Mocha coloured head with short retention. The nose is full of roasted malts, ground coffee and dark chocolate, with a touch of red fruit, umami and booze. Lots of coffee retronasal with just hints of bourbon. Flavour is moderate sweet with the bitterness of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Medium bodied. Long finish with lots of roast and chocolate, light bitterness.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Look - poured into a 5 oz tasting glass. Pitch black with a small head and some lacing.  Smell - strong coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and smokiness from the aging. Incredible complexity. Some booziness detected in the smell too.  Taste - coffee flavor dominates, followed by hints of chocolate and vanilla. A fair bit of carbonation, and smokiness is definitely present. Kind of like actually drinking an iced coffee. Finish is long and smooth. Really delicious.  Feel - full bodied, higher on carbonation than I would expect out of the style. A strong brew at 12.3%, but if you didn't check, you wouldn't even know because the alcohol is so well masked.  Overall - a phenomenal barrel aged stout that is really done right. Complexity paired with drinkability = perfection.

Look: Pours an inky black. About 1.5 cm of coffee coloured head with tight bubbles. Head slowly fades to a film that stays around for the duration of the beer.   Smell: Chocolate and vanilla straight up. Soon the coffee starts to come through, like espresso. A touch of raisin/dark dried fruit towards the end as the alcohol makes itself known.   Taste: Straight up, coffee. Like drinking a strong short black. The chocolate a vanilla comes through when you are a little more used to the coffee, but its a lot more restrained than it was on the nose. Roasty bitterness at the mid to front palate. A touch of bourbon. Definitely a bit of heat throughout, hiding behind the other flavours. Not much fruit, unlike the smell.   Feel: Full bodied, but with some prickly carbonation. The bitterness hits the front of the tongue and works its way back over the course of the beer. Good length and a little dry on the finish.   Overall: Its a fantastic beer, strong flavours, touch of heat but well masked and adds to the experience.

The chocolate and coffee are pungent and in your face, in a good way of course. The taste is also overflowing with blasts of chocolate and coffee, with a nice complexity. Founders did a good job on the carbonation level, not too crispy.    What a great imperial stout! Good job Founders!

It looks inviting, smells of dark plum and figs, tastes of faint coffee and caramel, and the mouth feel is a little bit syrupy (but then, how does a brewer dry out a beer with this much sugar content without falling into yeast decay taint?). Founders has walked the fine line here to produce a well-rounded masterpiece. Kudos!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 12oz bottle - 2018 vintage - 12.3% ABV - poured into a chianti glass at abiit 65F    Pours a glugging stream of motor oil brown, and sits in the glass obsidian black. Onyx. A plume of dark mocha head rises to the top, and proceeds to stand it's ground with a sizzle and hiss - holding two fingers of height for an impressive length of time. Eventualy, the head settles to a mocha film, and thick, sticky brown collar with tenacious lacing.    Nose is brightly roasted coffee out of the gate, carrying along a good smack of acidity, but without the green chili note I often get from coffee beer. Alongside the coffee, and boldly kilned malt, there is a strong presence of bourbon, barrel, and char. An oaky vanillin note presents itself. Molasses, brown sugar, a hint of maple, and oh so much coffee. No real dark fruit notes like the ones found in BCBS. Coffee is the dominant aroma.    On the palate, the coffee is thankfully more subdued than on the nose. It is very evident that this beer has spent a nice lengthy time inside a bourbon barrel. The opening note is semi-sweet chocolate, but then those familiar and beloved barrel notes slide right in. Vanilla, oak, char, bourbon fumes, very subtle licorice, very subtle cinnamon, more char, and then the chocolate turns dark, with tannic/charry/bitter/roasty/coffee notes unfolding late in the palate, and into the finish. There is a sweetness to it, but don't be fooled, this is not a dessert-sweet beer. Lots of dry, tannic, bitter notes to be found. Once the finish is in full swing, the roasted coffee once again presents itself as the dominant characteristic.     Mouthfeel on this one is slick, full bodied, smooth, slightly viscous, and essentially flat. The lazy carbonation can barely fight through the body of the beer - keep in mind, I do believe this was laid to rest in a barrel for an entire year? If so, very few bubbles are to be expected. There's the slightest bi of effervescence to provide some airy texture amidst the thick elixir, but I would hardly use the word "carbonated". More like, "almost sparkling"     Overall, this is a fantastic BBA stout, do not be fooled. I completely understand the prestigious repertoire this has. It's fantastic. I have trouble giving it stellar, world-class ratings, simply because there are some.insanely good BBA stouts out there. I think it's almost impossible to beat BCBS, and Bell's BA Expedition is a damn close second. HOWEVER....I find this offering from Founders to be more drinkable than the two of those. This lacks the syrupy sweetness and insane viscosity that those two beers possess. While I found those attributes to be part of what makes them so special, this dryer, less sweet and syrupy, slightly thinner beer that is KBS is definitely a beer all its own, and I must admit, is a little easier to drink in a sitting. Certainly not a fast gulper, but also not one that will take up to a day to finish. An outstanding barrel-aged stout from Founders that I will certainly spend money on in the future.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Sampled from a 9 ounce snifter.  Look: Deep black with a tiny amount of tan head.  Smell: Very dominant smell of vanilla.  Taste: Follows the noise with a delicious taste of vanilla. This beer is so smooth going down. I did not even detect the 12.3% ABV. This is one of the best tasting stouts that I have ever sampled.  Feel: Full-bodied beer with mild carbonation.  Overall: World-class on every level. I feel lucky being able to sample this beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Date: Bottled on 02/26/18, consumed on 12/12/18.    Appearance: Pours out solid and luscious black with a very minimal dark tan head.    Aroma: Semi sweet dark chocolate, bourbon, oak, coffee, cherry bark, raisin, roasted malts, and some slight vanilla. It smells nice and the adjuncts still pop much more than I had anticipated at almost ten months old.    Taste: KBS has some malty sweetness up front aided by the dark fruits and bourbon vanilla sweetness but it dries out some and gets a touch bitter thanks to the barrel character and the coffee. It does seem somewhat thin when compared to Barrel Aged Expedition Stout, The Abyss, or Sunday Morning Stout. However, this is a nice departure from onslaught on pastry stouts that have become so popular over the last few years and has a flavor profile that is reasonably close to a personal favorite, The Abyss, less some chocolate. KBS is a quality beer, it isn't worth chasing trucks for, especially when beers like The Abyss sits on shelves, but it is quite enjoyable.

The label says coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. and you will get a mouthful of all three. Pretty sweet and smooth considering that pedigree and the ABV it brings along for the ride. Alcohol feel is on the warming side and not the medicinal variety. Very smooth. I'd rather the chocolate and bourbon flavor be more prominent, but that's a completely personal taste and no knock on Founders   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Dark blackish brown appearance with no head. I smell mellow bourbon and a little chocolate. Taste is bourbon, big milk chocolate, toffee, caramel, black bread, a little coffee with a nice oaky hop finish. Taste resembles a Tootsie roll. I taste all these flavors separately then they all come together, starting with bourbon and ending with bourbon. Very little carbonation, fairly thick and very soft with a wet finish. This bottle was purchased 9 months after release and has lost most all coffee and much hop profile that would add some sharp contrasting flavors. Overall very good chocolate bourbon stout with a very mellow bourbon taste that does stand out. Even better fresh.

Lacing is very good too.    S: The smell is pretty strong on this one. You get a ton of cocoa, vanilla, coffee and bourbon. From the bourbon, you get a good amount of oak tannins and some light white pepper. There seems to be some light smoke and mineral notes too.    T: It's follows the smell very well. You get a ton of cocoa, vanilla, coffee bourbon, oak tannins, white pepper (much stronger than anticipated) and smoke. It's very complex and coherent and round. Surprisingly not too sweet either. Very well balanced. Not too much alcohol burn.     M: Super broad and thick as expected for the genre and the ABV. A bit sticky, but it's not too bad.    O: This is a world class beer, no doubt about it. It's super easy to recommend to all imperial stout lovers. The only thing I could improve on it would be to try different bourbon barrels.

Amazing aroma of dark roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, caramel,bourbon, vanilla and leather. The taste start of with strong flavour of dark chocolate and coffe, is also a slight sweetness of bourbon in there that balance the roasted tones perfectly. The finish has a bitterness that is balanced greatly with the strong malty flavour. The aftertaste is strong with a great lenght. The flavour improves even more when it warms up. Mouthfeel is creamy and oily with a full body and medium carbonation.   An amazing beer and a real flavour bomb. To enjoy slowly.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I love stouts. This is one of my favorite stouts, and having it on tap is the best. It has a good three layered body, decent lacing, and rich flavor accompanied with a good coffee smell. Since the aging process is quite significant with this beer, i feel the vanilla compliments the bourbon flavor, and makes the overall feel a little bit subtle and pleasant. I would compare this with a fine Malbec or a $70 wine bottle. I feel that this should be enjoyed a little bit on a cooler side, and then let your hands warm the beer to a comfortable temperature on your last sip.     Look: 4.5/5. Good three layers with a quarter to half inch head. This causes a decent lacing on the lower side, and not too much   Smell: 4.75/5. Perfect blend of ingredients, coffee and vanilla with a bourbon hint. The coffee has a toasted smell because of the age  Taste: 4.75/5. Good rich taste. It has got a refined taste that will make you smile, but does not leave an after taste. Perfect beer for stout lovers.   Feel: 4.5/5. It is a beer that i would recommend on a cooler night. Having this during spring time, on tap is perfect. You can feel three stages with this. First one where you take in the cold sip, the second one is where the flavor settles on your pallet and you get the stout flavor and the third one is where it soothes you as you swallow it.  Overall: 4.5/5 i recommend this and is my Friday or Saturday night drink at a local bar. Must try it’s and get one of the best beer drinking experience.

It starts with vanilla, caramel and then moves to bourbon and ends in dark chocolate with a big smily end.  T: Taste starts with vanilla and caramel. It then changes to the slight sweetness of dark chocolate and in between you a boozy blanket of bourbon that's just great. Just like Backwoods, this is a perfect marriage of whisky and beer.

Great retention, if not 'out of this world'.   The nose is a treat - rich dark chocolate and aged rum, complimented by lighter notes of medium roast coffee and vanilla. My mind keeps going to rum cake, or a true, aged fruit cake.   A velvety smooth feel and luscious chocolate flavour are the first things to stand out, like an authentic hot chocolate. Once again that fruity, sweet, rum flavour kicks in, right after the chocolate and lingering through the finish. I wish this came in cake form. Light burn of alcohol provides balance to the sweetness, which thankfully isn't cloying or heavy-handed. Dried fruit (dates, figs, raisins) flavours come to mind, and vanilla. A touch of coffee. Easy-drinking despite the intense flavours, with a medium body and medium-light, very fine carbonation.    Get your hands on this come Fall! KBS is an outstanding stout, with a complex marriage of flavours and luxurious feel. A pure delight, perfect for dessert - make it chocolate, with berries, or a coffeecake.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Thank you, Rkitchen!   Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) brown bottle into a conical pint glass; 2018 release (bottled on 02/21/2018).  A: Pours a very, very dark brown color (but not quite black) with excellent formation of a one inch plus, light brown head, moderate retention, but rings and rings of serious lacing.  S: Gorgeous nose with aromas of chocolate > coffee (but definitely both), vanilla, frankly very reminiscent of a chocolate ice cream malted. As warms, more of a bourbon note.  T: Chocolate and coffee are very evident, with vanilla and bourbon flavors much more evident. Thought I detected orange peel and spicy notes. Aging from oak and higher order alcohols both seem to be present. Bitterness imparts almost a birch or sarsaparilla note.  M: Full bodied with solid, very persistent carbonation. Creamy and smooth.  O: Wow! If you like stouts and porters, this is for you. Delicious, high quality stout, not much more to say.

However, I tend to compare it to Russian Imperials, and that is not a fair comparison at all.,,with that being said....the profile fits a barrel aged porter more than a stout. I know that technically, a stout is a stout porter....higher alcohol content....the current taste profile and thinness of this beer reminds me of a porter and not a stout....however times 2...it is a damn fine barrel aged porter...or a middle of the road barrel aged stout. All that being said...just make the thing 15 percent. It will hide the problems.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Smell is chocolate coffee with some dark fruit. Taste starts with the dark fruits then transitions into very good dark dutch cocoa powder. Then from mid to finish it has strong booze. Finishes with oaky vanilla then with hot cocoa. the hot cocoa finish does linger for a bit which is nice. Although this is a little thin and has more carbonation then i expect, overall this is a good boozy hot chocolate stout.

There's been other brews I have had that have not, but this one certainly does. From the time I poured it out of the bottle from the time I downed it, it was dark, laced on the pint glass, and did I mention dark...The smell was everything you would expect - boozy, chocolaty, full of the scent of coffee - and that goes for the taste as well. Mouthfeel is something I am rarely impressed with when it comes to beers - but this one was creamy, light on the carbonation (like I like it) and for all the bourbon - smooth. Yes, it was a special experience at the end of a long weekend to sip this and enjoy it.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 With 13K ratings, I'm not sure what there is to say about this beer. I can't score it at the levels it is listed here (4.6), but it is certainly a great beer. Lots of coffee and chocolate in the nose and taste, but I didn't get quite as much bourbon and barrel notes as I was expecting. A little rougher mouthfeel as the carbonation is higher than I like for the style. Great beer.

The aroma is roasted malts with light espresso and milk chocolate.  The taste is roasted malts with hints of roasted coffee beans, rich dark chocolate, burnt caramel, cardamon, earthy molasses and a peppery hop presence.  heavy body, medium carbonation, wonderful, spicy finish.    2016/2018  Chocolate, bourbon and barrel char. Malts take a back seat as it ages. Surprisingly it still has a nip of alcohol and it has kept a good amount of carbonation. 8 months to a year is still the sweet spot for me with this beer.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Sampling a cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into my snifter. The beer pours a pitch black color with creamy dense tan to brown head of 3 cm foaming up on a gentle pour. The foam fades to a sturdy surface layer slowly after the pour.  The aroma is deep rich and malty with dark chocolate and some bourbon notes, also a bit of boozy warmth even on the nose here. A little molasses and some anice with hints of coffee grounds. No hops showing up here that I can really pick out.   The texture is very smooth and carbonation is mild and gently rolls across my palate. The body is pretty thick as anticipated for this large imperial stout.  Flavor is a dose of sweet and also dark chocolate, some molasses and roasted coffee. Some rich bourbon also comes through and the booze is very well hidden for this high ABV. Again the hops are buried and make no appearance.  This is a super drinkable and smooth imperial stout for how large of a beer it is. Im glad to have had this bottle and would definitely buy and drink this again.

Nice aroma with notes of dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, elegant bourbon, cocoa, port wine and dark fruits.  Flavor with notes of dark chocolate, citrusy and piney hops, spices, coffee, molasses, licorice, nuts, oak, mild bourbon, mixed dark fruits and port wine. Dry and bitter aftertaste; clean without extending too much on roasted notes.  Bordering full body with perfect carbonation. it feels lighter. Alcohol of 11.9% is deceptive.  Superbly balanced RIS with great complexity without being confusing or having single flavors predominating over others. It does have an original flavor although many have followed it. And sure, part is hype (I was debating about giving it 4.5), but still a superior well-crafted beer.

Oh man, a flavoured stout that actually tastes of the stuff it's flavoured with. The bourbon in the aftertaste is very aggressive after not long. Very much reminds me of a stout with chilli pepper. Otherwise quite sweet but the bitter whisky aftertaste turns my stomach a little.    Started well but after a few minutes, oh boy is it aggressive. Give me a Good King Henry any day.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 355 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before Feb 13 2019 and served barely chilled. Not the first time I've tried this - I enjoyed the '17 batch, but never got around to reviewing it.    Pours ebony jet-black, topped with a half-finger of frothy, dark tan-coloured head that wilts within 90 seconds; a bubbly cap and wide, creamy collar remain, along with a liberally-applied coat of lovely lace. On the nose, coffee grounds virtually leap out of the glass and tantalize the nostrils; they're accompanied by robust notes of molasses, bourbon, oak and baker's chocolate. Minor hints of vanilla, smoky ash, herbal licorice and ethanol also come through as it warms.    If you're trying your first KBS, ensure that you're seated before you take a sip - it's so tasty that your knees might start to wobble and give way. OK, maybe I'm exaggerating, but rich, decadent and intense are still the adjectives that immediately come to mind - roasted malts and coffee beans, dark chocolate and vanilla, as well as bourbon whiskey, molasses and oak wood combine together into an absurdly yummy conflagration of flavour. Towards the finish, hints of herbal licorice, burnt wood and bourbon provide an added kick, with the latter element lasting on, well into a boozy-sweet aftertaste that lingers. The ethanol is well-integrated with the flavour profile, but still very potent and impossible to dismiss; it's actually concentrated enough to numb the palate somewhat after a couple of sips. Full-bodied, with very low carbonation levels that barely even register; it has a silky-smooth, satisfying texture on the palate.    Final Grade: 4.59, an A+. Founders KBS is one of the best stouts I've ever tried, and an undoubtedly excellent, world-class beer that I'd be thrilled to drink again. There's no subtlety to be found here - this one wallops you in the face, over and over again, with more coffee, chocolate and bourbon/oak than your taste buds will know what to do with. I don't know if it's one of the 50 best beers on the planet, but it's a damn good one either way: I'll be picking up a few more bottles before the stock runs dry, because it's not as if beers this amazing show up in Ontario every month.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Look The beer pours deep brown, though it’s pitch black in this glass. There is a thin light brown head that dissipates quickly; the bubbles are fairly uniform. There is no lacing left on the glass.     Smell: Lots of molasses and chocolate. No coffee or oak on the nose, which is surprising considering all my beer friends in California have assured me that 2018 is nothing but barrel.     Taste: The taste follows the nose. There is lots and lots of dark chocolate, which these dominates all the way through. Not much molasses in the taste. Coffee is again not apparent. Very slight barrel warming in the very end, with just a tiny hint of oak. I’ve had the 2017 CBS and the taste is definitely reminiscent of that in some sense. Alcohol is very well hidden for it being a 12% beer.     Feel: Medium body, medium carbonation. Don’t know what else to say.     Overall: Considering the California prices, I got this 2018 bottle for pretty cheap. All my beer friends have described this beer as an underperformer due to too much barrel on both the nose and the smell. Honestly I’m not getting much of that. Chocolate is definitely the dominant flavor overall. This stout is very well made and is great overall, but it’s definitely not a standout among its class in 2018. Would I buy more bottles at $2.50 a pop again, absolutely. Is it worth to seek out or spend more for than its real market value currently — definitely not in 2018 NorCal.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 A- Pours a very opaque, and very dark brown color....near impossible to see through. The head starts out about one finger thick and looks super frothy!.....it is toffee colored and retains rather well into a half finger thick layer over the brew. The lacing, while thick, doesn't really do any sort of clinging around the inside of my glass, leaving only behind a couple of small scattered blobs. Decent looking overall!    S- Huge amounts of dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, black coffee, some vanilla molasses sweetness, bourbon barrel woodiness. The overall aroma is rich, delicate and smooth. Hints of black and dark chocolate barley malt make their presence known too, and the finish is of a dry Earthy sweetness, with perhaps some fresh coffee bean grinds and subtle hop bitterness.    T- Wow, this is a nice tasting Stout! Huge deep dark chocolate right up front, with background notes of licorice, oak aged bourbon, tender vanilla bean pods, dark fruit pits.....kind of a rummy booziness, and lots of dark/toasty malts that provide a dry astringency throughout the finish! There is an alcohol burn that runs from the back of the throat straight down into the gut and the dryness/booze lingers a little bit on the palate.    M/O- I was very surprised with how bubbly this is!......plenty of effervescence to this medium-full bodied brew! The drinkability is kind of low in my opinion, as it is much too rich to have more than a half bottle of at any one time.....definitely a sipping beer and it needs something sweet (or a nutty chocolate) to pair up with this. This is a good beer, if not a little overrated.....it could be a little more sociable and a little high in alcohol content.

Smells of chocolate, alcohol, and roasted malts. Tastes of bitter chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and oak--alcohol is definitely present but not a kick in the teeth. Coffee, more wood and more chocolate as it warms up. Super smooth and creamy mouthfeel, heavy and syrupy body with low carbonation. This is great, but maybe not up to the massive hype. Wish I could compare to some older versions.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Holy Moses! This beer is no joke. Rich, chocolatey, and delicious with a kick like a Southern mule. I thought I knew what I was getting into with this bad boy, but when push came to shove, I was woefully unprepared. I managed to score a 32oz growler of this nectar from a tap house today and was looking forward to settling into a good movie and a couple of imperial pints. It pours a bit like bottled Guinness, and not that fancy schmancy widget "draft bottle" stuff, but rather the old school, tan label, "we scored a crate off a truck in Armagh" Guinness bottles. Thin, but not watery. Black as coal, with almost zero carbonation. A tiny cocoa brown head forming at the top of the pint. I was instantly intrigued.   As for bouquet, it is stouty and complex without being overly so. There are hints of dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, and (unsurprisingly) bourbon.  I tipped the pint to my lips and BAM! The taste. Smooth, thick, coffee laced, with a delicious oatmealy richness, but what most surprised me is the dryness. The high ABV is reminiscent of Monster's Barleywine more than any stout I've ever had. At first, it almost put me off. But the more I had, the more I realized how delicious and balanced it is, even with its extraordinarily high alcohol content.  The mouth on this beer is slightly syrupy and thick, as it coats the tongue, but it maintains its traditional stout drinkability. It's as if a standard, run of the mill, draft Guinness had a love child with Sam Adams notorious triple bock. Potent, yet incredibly drinkable.    This is not a beer for beginners, or for tossing back. Its high ABV and complex profile will knock you down the stairs if you aren't careful, but It is rapidly becoming a new favorite and may just have become my new signature beer.

T: Rich dark chocolate, roasted malt and a bit of smoke, mingles with earthy roast chocolate, a small note of sweet vanilla, dark stone fruit and vanilla, very complex with lots of different things going on but it blends together very well.    F: Big body, creamy but some acid from the bourbon.     O: Excited to finally try this and it fully lived up to the hype.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 I’ve been waiting a long, long time for this one: Founders KBS. I’m a touch apprehensive reviewing KBS, what with my FBS review still the most liked on BeerAdvocate, it’s like a beer reviewers version of a sophomore album, how do you follow that? By doing the best damn review ever! [no pressure] So here we have it, Founders mightiest of whales (only CBS comes close to the legend status of this brew). Must be reasonably fresh as well – it’s got a BB of 13.02.19 (I’m guessing Founders have a 2 year BB, so that would make the bottling date: 13 Feb 17). That been said age isn’t too much of a concern, apart from reports of coffee-flavour dropping off, this should be really tasty firecracker of a Stout.    Poured from a 355ml bottle into a Duvel tulip.    A: Blacker than Darth Vader’s knickers, which are a combination of obsidian and jet black, with a thin tan lace ring and minor head retention – it looks exactly like FBS, so formidable that it warrants a 10/10 too.    S: Unlike FBS this has quite the complex aroma: bourbon sweetness, of course, oak/woody/vanilla tones, dark chocolate, roasted coffee, (no doubt) unwarranted hints of spirit giving off an almost Japanese sweet potato shochu character (yeah, I thought that was weird too). Unsurprisingly KBS is making my olfactory senses it’s bitch, thanks KBS, yes I will do anything you tell me to do. 9/10.    T: “POW! Right in the kisser!” says KBS. This is a mighty, yet smooth as an R&B singer, American Imperial Stout, right up there with the best of the best, all hail KBS! [we’re not worthy, we’re not worthy!] Flavour profile is: roasted coffee, dark chocolate, bourbon, oak/woody/vanilla, molasses, with a light coffee bitterness in the finish, and a kiss of bourbon burn at the back of the throat. This is simply awesome. Balance is sublime, even though the aroma hinted at ethanol, the flavour profile hides the 12.3% ABV exceedingly well. A real sipper of a brew here. 10/10.    M: Heavy-bodied, viscous to the max, as is the Founders way, with a smooth/creamy/luscious mouth-feel. “Oooo this beer is sexy!” [said in a James Brown voice]. Can’t beat Founders body. 10/10.    D: Near perfect Imperial Stout this is. One thing to be noticed though towards the end of the glass – my tongue actually went numb, which could have been a combination of the heavy ABV and it just plain shutting down due to flavour overload. Founders delivers gold with my new favourite Stout. 9/10.    Food match: The only food to match with KBS: KBS [in food form].   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5 A: So brown it's black. No light gets through. Pours like tar with minimal head.    S: Smell of malty, creamy, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and roasted nuts right off the bat. Smell drifts and changes, almost a dance with each move hitting the spot. This smell is happiness on a cold day and warms your heart. Exquisite.    T: Wow. So complex, so dark and rich. Tastes of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and a nice roasted malt. I can't quite pin down how they all play into each other, but it works and I'm amazed at how each sip seems so different than the last. Hides the alcohol well.    O: World class. Incredibly intense without going over the top. Probably won't be able to drink too many of these, but it's a paradigm changing experience. Sets a new bar for dark beer in my book.

Cream, burnt black coffee, dark chocolate syrup & mild oak notes in the nose.     Medium mouthfeel.     Cream, burnt black coffee & dark chocolate syrup flavors up front; mild oak & mild bourbon heat notes on the finish.     No coffee at this point, but I can never taste any anyways. This tastes like a McDonald's coffee with cream & chocolate syrup added, plus a splash of bourbon. This is an average beer.

This will make you say aloud YOU SHALL NOT PASS until the next one!

Sweet dark malt and roasted malt flavors followed by medium high hop bitterness. Finished semi-dryly with roasted malt and boozy notes and a lingering earthy bitterness.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Definite chocolate and coffee but the star is the bourbon undertone. There are other brews that tout aging in bourbon barrels (and are very good), but you really get the alcohol taste with those. While this one does as well, it's not nearly 'in your face' (to me, anyway). Very good.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.75 2018 Release:  L - Deep, opaque black with a dark tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly but leaves behind a decent amount of lacing behind.   S - Bittersweet chocolate and coffee on the nose along with a decent amount of malt and hints of bourbon. The smell is good but it's not strong at all.   T - Tons of bittersweet chocolate and bitter coffee throughout followed quickly behind with bourbon and oak. The bourbon leaves slight warming alcohol notes on the back end. Vanilla and nuttiness are intermixed throughout as well along with a roasted, malt backbone to tie it all together.   F - Medium to full bodied but leaning more toward the medium side of things with a light amount of carbonation. Silky smooth, but syrupy at the same time. Personally, for such robust flavors, I think the feel could be much fuller.   O - This is a hell of a bourbon stout with rich complexity that definitely lives up to the hype, but that said I do think there might be better or at the very least equal bourbon imperial stouts out there. The only weak points of this beer are the smell which could be stronger in my opinion and the feel could be fuller. Otherwise, a fantastic stout.

The smell is like a boozy log cabin! That's a trip I want to be on. Those barrels and their distinct liquor taste and flavor have mightily seeped into these beers. It's everything one desires in a big ass stout - it's nutty, creamy, robustly dark with coffee, chocolate... A velvet smooth nectar from Jesus. This 12.3% mofo deserves the title it holds and the reputation is merited. Cheers.

I proudly salute Founders for creating such an exceptional beer!!

Like licking the inside of the barrel after it was emptied of beer.

The hallmark of this beer has been the velvety smoothness and aged depth. That’s missing a bit to me. Still a great stout, but not the undisputed king status it once held. If I get me hands on another one, I will let it age for a while.

No overpowering alcohol despite the content, but instead softer vanilla, coffee, and subtle roasted malts.   T: this beer saves the best for the taste. So perfectly balanced for an imperial stout. It's easy to get coffee and chocolate, but the vanilla flavors from the oak help round it out nicely. Bourbon flavors permeate throughout but without overwhelming.   M: heavy enough but if there is a weakpoint in this beer for me I think it's here. Just slightly too thin for me  O: overall it's an outstanding beer. Probably my favorite imperial stout that I've tried yet. The flavors are just so perfectly balanced and it rounds out so nicely at the end it's just a pleasure to drink. My only regret is that I'm trying it at the beginning of spring instead of on the first cold day of winter.

I'm not sure I agree with the description, "subtle hints of chocolate and coffee." The chocolate and coffee was so strong it completely overpowered any semblances of hops or malt. These flavors even overpowered the bourbon, which is a shame, especially since this is likely the most expensive and time consuming process of production. I was tempted to put a scoop of vanilla ice cream in there just to embrace it. I've got a few more left, I'll give it a try. As far as other attributes; it looks, smells, and feels great...just be prepared, don't expect it to taste like beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5 Bottled on Feb. 9, 2018. Pitch black with a good amount of khaki foam for a big stout. The aroma really pops with rich, decadent notes of mocha/vanilla/bourbon that are nicely blended together. This is a pretty fresh bottle, so the booze notes are somewhat prominent, but they don't smother the aromas of the base beer. Coffee notes are quite a bit more subtle than in other Founders coffee beers like Breakfast Stout and Sumatra Mountain Brown.    Bittersweet dark chocolate and coffee hit the palate first. A brief wave of sweetness fades as the bourbon and wood flavors come into play. Booze only intrudes on the finish. Mouthfeel is very soft and smooth, and the only knock against it is that Founders couldn't match the richness/chewiness of their Imperial Stout. Having finally gotten my hands on one of the longest-tenured, most venerable Bourbon barrel stouts, it definitely lives up to the acclaim it has received over the years.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Appearance: dark, DARK brown; a wee hair shy of black, yet not black. The head forms a 1-finger of coffee-and-cream colored foam with excellent retention. Dark brown, silky and luxurious when poured. Velvety. This beer does not resemble 10W30 when poured as so many other imperial stouts do (which is neither a positive or negative.)    Aroma: wonderful. Boozy. Chocolate, fudge and coconut. I wouldn’t have picked up the coffee if it weren’t referenced on the beer’s label.    Flavor: very boozy but not hot. Milk chocolate, coconut, bourbon and oak all in harmony.     Mouthfeel: thick and chewy; a meal by itself.    Overall: very, very good. I commend Founders for bottling this in 12oz bottles; a 750ml would be way too much. The 12oz format allows me not to have to share it. This BA imperial stout is near the top of a long list that I’ve tried. I’d put it alongside Bourbon County and Pirate Bomb as the best.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 So excited to run into this. Finally appeared at my local Whole Foods (highest praise for their beer selection). Pouring one into a goblet on a late Friday morning. Happy 4/20!    L: Looks pretty typical of a BA Stout. Black as night, with a centimeter multicolored mocha/tan head. Hard to see how well-carbonated, as light cannot penetrate more than a centimeter, but from the persistence of the head, it can be assumed it is substantially so.    S: Very sweet. First I get maple and chocolate syrup, a splash of espresso, then toffee, vanilla, bourbon, fudge, molasses, coconut cream, then some subtle hop character of sage and lemon, salty soy sauce and a finish of dark roast coffee. Smells delicious and beautifully balanced.    T: Like giving God a rim job. Holy. Shit. The level of sweetness is somewhat subtler and comes off absolutely PERFECT on the palate. Chocolate and vanilla battle for dominance within an oak bourbon barrel, but coffee comes in and beats the crap out of both of them, with a little assistance from soy sauce and herbal hops. Finish is acidic, dark-roasted coffee with no cloying sweetness, and just a hint of hops that complement the roast.    F: Smooth, with a creamy consistency like whole milk. Not syrupy at all, as you might think from the smell. I would guess this crisp finish is likely the first attribute that would suffer with age.    O: SO damn good. It brings me back to my single random encounter with BCBS. Definitely a world-class BA Stout.    Edit: P. S. Had another one a little colder in the evening as an experiment. It is acceptable to drink the this brew at any temperature between 45-65°F, but peak deliciousness is somewhere in the higher range, around 58°.

S - Smells like my morning cup of Joe! A hint of the bourbon and can vaguely detect chocolate.  T - Wow - first sip was incredible. I know the beer has high ratings but was going in being critical and was not let down. Coffee up front, with hints of chocolate - chocolate flavors finish stronger with coffee notes lingering and the sensation and flavorings of the bourbon starting to come into the picture.  M - Perfect.  O - Wow. Again. Was somewhat expecting this to be over hyped and plagued by group think but this is truly an exceptional beer! I was not let down and will be looking forward to chasing this beer down every year just as I do with the Hopslam ale.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 This beer is a legend and another that has somehow become fashionable to take shots at, sort of like Hopslam and a bunch of others. Not sure how Bourbon County escapes this, maybe because it's a sloppy boozy mess? Anyway, absolutely easier to find than it was two or three or 8 years ago, but still outstanding.    I get about 1/8 inch of head after an aggressive pour, quickly dissipating into a ring of tight, creamy foam around the perimeter of the glass. Not quite black but very dark. Aroma dominated by chocolate moreso than coffee, light bourbon on the nose. Not overpowering whatsoever. Excellent.    Tastes like it smells. Very smooth going in and zero alcohol burn. I would never guess that this beer is even similar in abv to say, Black Note. Nice chocolate flavor, very faint coffee presence, zero alcohol. This is not to say that it's a training wheels beer, but rather it's approachable and actually superb.    Medium body, decent carbonation, which surprised me. Similar in the mouth to the last batch of CBS.    This beer remains world class. I do not have anything close to a criticism of the beer itself, and it's not even difficult to find anymore. I guess it's expensive? I paid $8 a bottle, I suppose that's a lot. Recommend highly.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 I'm not a big fan of stouts (even though my highest rated beer is a stout... go figure) but this is something glorious. I didn't see any ABV on the bottle at first and I'm here drinking it and thinking to myself: "I'm only half way done with the beer and I feel drunk!". haha. What is truly amazing is that this 2018 release has 12.3% ABV in it and you CANNOT tell it is that strong. Masterful blending! I've had beers at 9% ABV and you can tell it is strong by the burning alcohol. Not this beer!     Inky black in color, khaki colored head, smells of cocoa and coffee. The taste is VERY smooth. The bitters are there but it reminds me of the sort of bite that you get from drinking Barqs Root Beer. It doesn't turn your face inside out, very smooth and easy to drink. SO easy to drink.    This is my first time trying KBS so I can't compare it to prior years but comparing this to other stouts... this is my 2nd favorite stout I've ever tried. I've tried several stouts and they are often WAY too bitter. This is more my style. Really good beer! The negatives is how expensive it is and how difficult it can be to acquire.    I'm drinking it to celebrate finishing my taxes! I needed something to uplift me after such a grueling tax season. Note to the wise: drink this carefully. I drank 3/4th of it in 15 minutes and I'm a bit drunk!

I had this beer several years back at a tasting event, and I remember it being superior to what I just imbibed. Last year's regular breakfast stout also seemed a bit more one-dimensional than in the past. Could be in my head. Still very delicious. Vanilla extract scent, Espresso-forward with a dry cinnamon finish. The closer to room temp, the more you taste the bourbon on the back end.

Can taste the alcohol at the finish of this one. Pricey, but worth it. Only critique, which is a personal preference, would be...I like stouts to be a bit creamier.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 12 oz bottle, bottled 2/15/18 , 12.3 %, poured into a tulip glass. Pitch black, no head, only a thin rim of off tan lace. The aroma is even; coffee, vanilla, chocolate, a smidge of oak and bourbon. Flavor is right in line, very well balanced, the barrel comes through more as it warms, and with it there is no heat or burn. Mouthfeel is medium heavy, with a decent amount of carbonation holding it together. Slight stickiness as it warms. After several years of not finding this, glad to finally get the opportunity to try this for beer #700. It's a very well blended beer, everything is there, and no flavor dominates.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 It’s hard to give a lasting review as this beer changes slightly each season. The 2016 and 2017 were phenomenal. 2018 (this review)is a bit too coffee forward which eclipses the bourbon and chocolate profiles. A hard pour into a snifter glass gives a nice tan head. Tilt pours don’t fully form the head. I smell the coffee more than the bourbon, chocolate or oaky barrel. The beer itself is as dark as my soul. It’s has a nice silky feel and the flavor lingers on the tongue. Again, this is my impression of 2018 KBS solely. I prefer the 2016 rendition.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 2018 vintage. Poured from 12 oz bottle into snifter. Bottled on 03.05.18. 12.31% ABV.  A: Pours an extremely dark brown with nice 1 inch dark mocha head with good retention.  S: Smooth dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, cream, vanilla, and a hint of bourbon.  T: Very smooth dark chocolate, soft medium roast coffee, vanilla, cream, sweet bourbon, and hint of charred wood.  M: Extremely smooth. Viscous feel. Darkly sweet. Mild alcohol burn. Charred wood comes through more in the finish. Nice lingering and maturing on the palate.  D: Finally got around to this one! Solid brew...but very expensive. Will be interesting to see how this develops over time.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2018    Look - This beer is dark and rich looking, a good solid black. However, it still had a nice, healthy finger and a half of tan, frothy head to it.    Smell - The smell of coffee and chocolate was very noticeable immediately upon opening, even from a few feet away. There are also significant notes of wood from the barrel-aging as well as a cinnamon note I didn't expect.    Taste - This is coffee forward, but almost a flavored coffee. It was like a cinnamon espresso type flavor. The chocolate was actually more subtle than expected given how strong it was on the nose. The vanilla was also prevalent, along with a certain dry, woodiness. Some boozy notes are present as well, but overall the cinnamon takes the stage.    Feel - This was surprisingly smooth and creamy, like an Irish stout, rather than thick and oily like so many other barrel aged stouts.    Overall - This is an absolutely delicious cinnamon coffee with cream stout. I have no idea where the cinnamon came from, but it was there. This had a great balance of sweet and bitter to it. Overall I really enjoyed this, definitely more than last year's release.    Pairs Well With - An afternoon pick-me-up.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 An outstanding example of a good breakfast stout. Not too boozy. It's balanced, thick, remarkably smooth and black as pitch. First time I've had it. Poured from a bottle into a wide-mouthed chalice. Excellent.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 2018 12oz. Not to boozy at all, I shared some with a friend without telling him what it is and he simply said "tastes like a good stout". Big coffee and chocolate without much barrel flavor but in my mind that is a good thing. While I enjoyed the feel I wish it were a little thicker.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Poured from 12oz bottle into 20oz imperial snifter glass. Bottled 2/19/18.   Look: Pours dark brown, near black. About 2 and a half fingers width of a frothy tan head was attained from a simple pour (which dissipated rapidly). Good amount of lacing on the glass.   Smell: Oak forward, with slight chocolate presence. Some coffee is present on the nose, but I am not picking up much. Bourbon isn't detectible on the nose.   Taste: Oak, oak, ash, and more oak. The flavor is overpowered by the oak barrel presence. Even as it warms, the chocolate does become more pronounced, but at minimal levels compared to the oak. I am not sure, but taste wise I am not enjoying this as much as I hoped. The bourbon flavor is present on the finish, but yet again, the oak overpowers in a woody sense.   Feel: Medium body and medium weight, with moderate carbonation for the style.   Overall: I was really disappointed with this years KBS. The oak was just too overpowering for my liking. Maybe next years will be better. Regardless, I am glad to have tried. Cheers!

Bottled 3/6/18, 12.31 ABV.    L: Poured into a ST. Bernardus snifter, Nice almost ebony color, 1/2" mocha colored head that subsided to a small island with a ring of lacing around the glass. The head disappears as the beverage is consumed and the lacing remaining on the glass is minimal.     S: Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oak and booze with a hint of caramel and dark fruit. As it warms boozy alcohol increases as does the caramel.     T: Oak, vanilla, dark chocolate, slightly bitter coffee and char at first, creamy dark chocolate, vanilla caramel cream, raisin, date, alcohol and oak in the middle with bitter chocolate strong bitter coffee more oak, caramel, vanilla, alcohol and bourbon on the end. The bourbon, booze and bakers unsweetened chocolate stays with you for some time, well into the next sip. The ABV is evident as would be expected for a 12.31% brew, it is not overwhelming but there is some heat.    F: The mouthfeel is world class! Thick and creamy, chewy and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation.     O: An extremely complex, chewy beer with world class mouthfeel and some great flavor profiles working well together. The only element that keeps it from being as good as CBS or Morning Wood in my opinion is that there is some heat and grain alcohol smell and taste that is objectionable. I believe that some time in the cellar may turn this into an outstanding beer but as a fresh pour, it is really good with possible potential to be more. I have three more from this batch that I will allow to mature and if warranted I will come back to this review and update.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 4 I first must say that I have not rated KBS because I thought the hype was ridiculous. I had no problem buying two cases in the 1 bottle only heyday. I really enjoyed it and will admit to "overdoing" it. That being said this is a fresh review years later. Looks black as used oil with a mocha colored head. Tastes like burnt toast,vanilla,coffee,chocolate,hops. Feels very smooth and well balanced. I remember more creaminess, (perhaps more oats) Overall a highly regarded Adjunct stout. Revision;4/25/18 : I remember this stout as being a bit more chewy and substantial,the chocolate seemed thicker and the coffee stronger. Seems a tad bit watery from what my memory recalls. This recipe seems thinner than the original release.

Got an inch or so of dark khaki brown head that is fairly stable and sticks to the side of the glass, very pretty beer. Smell is big, with the chocolate and coffee up front, a touch of bourbon and a little booze on the nose. Taste is a lot of chocolate and coffee, almost like mocha. A little bit of bourbon, but not quite as much as I’d expect. Feel is viscous af, with a little alcohol burn, but very luxurious. Overall, damn fine stuff, but it could really use some age. I wish there was a little more bourbon and oak character, but with all of the extra flavors, a little aging could adjust that. Good, good stuff, but it’d be good to buy two and stash one.

This is one of the few beers that I preferred from the bottle. The draft tastes slightly more alcoholic than its counterpart. If your vessel is a bottle, pour this guy hard to create a creamy foam that is bursting with chocolate aroma. The first sip delivers velvety bourbon flavor followed by chocolate and coffee. The most surprising thing with this beer is how smooth the beer is given the ABV. Not much alcohol taste compared to many other bourbon barrel aged beers. Very well crafted. If you are deciding between this and CBS, get both. However the KBS isn’t nearly as sweet and has much stronger bourbon flavors. Personally I prefer the CBS but true bourbon fans should travel to Kentucky before picking up the maple leaf.

Outstanding looking stout.     S: Big oak aromas out front on the nose. Along with oak there are also faint amounts of chocolate. Not getting any coffee smells out of the beer.     T: Flavors are similar to the nose but with the addition of coffee. Oak, again, seems to be the main flavor. But more flavors are noticeable here than were on the nose. The beer has a stronger chocolate like sweetness and there is also a clear amount of coffee.     M: Medium bodied stout. A bit thinner than the flavors would imply, but makes for an easy drinker. Flavors and other areas make this beer an easy drinker.     O: Very nice beer. Didn't get much coffee from the nose but it was apparent on the taste. Hopefully with some age the oak flavors dial back some. Will be looking for more of this as I only bought a single.

Very creamy, very smooth. Yet robust. Hard to find fault in the mouthfeel.     It's rich and balanced enough to warrant it's public praise. Happy to have a chance at it. Worth the steep price? Maybe, and I'm apt to re-visit future vintages if avail.

Everything blends together in the best way and I mean the best way. Nothing is overwhelming yet everything stands out. Bravo Founders!

This year I picked a four pack up at Brooklyn Fare in the West Village. I'll write a review later    After drinking a great double chocolate stout from Lancaster brewery in PA, having KBS tonight was a treat. This is a legendary stout that lives up to the hype every year. I don't have tasting notes from the prior years, but this hits me with a much boozier smell and taste. A nice surprise. Will be trying them side by side at Upright this week.    L: Dark, midnight color  S: More chocolate than coffee notes. Boozier than I remember  T: Smooth, chocolate upfront, hints of vanilla first, then coffee. Not just any coffee, a note of brown sugar, a drop of half and half, almost espresso with a 1:1.2 ristretto. Like syrup. more like a Typica varietal of arabica, sweet and full, able to hold up to the other strong tastes. Bourbon at the end with a much more boozy note that is welcomed an appreciated   F: Let me pour another. Velvety mouthfeel, lighter than the big tastes. the weight of a neat bourbon  O: I will buy a couple dozen to enjoy over the year. Quite amazing. Great job

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 12oz bottle. 3/6/18 bottle date. Appearance: Opaque black with a thick dark khaki head and great lacing Aroma: Medium roasted coffee, dark chocolate, a touch of dark fruit, vanilla, and slight malt oxidation. Taste: Rich dark chocolate sweetness up front, a light roasted coffee, a touch of vanilla, and a light oak character with a touch of bourbon heat. Some dark fruitiness arrivescafter the swallow. Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy bodied with a touch of creaminess and a low carbonation. Bourbon barrel brings only the slightest alcohol warmth in the back end, surprising for a beer of this strength Finish: Dark chocolate abounds, with some lingering coffee roast and a touch of vanilla and oak. Overall: Unbelievable balance between the strong dark chocolate malt character, a strong but balanced coffee roast, and an underlying oaked character of vanilla and spice. Remarkably smooth for a beer with this much complexity going on. Definitely a beer for relaxing by the fire

Actually, had purchased, held & drank the Founders' CBS before this one. This one definitely tops that - for my tastes. Delicious! Satiates my palate for chocolate / coffee / bourbon finish. Well-worth the price to savor.!

Holding this up to the light, no brown or red here folks, this is all black.    A: Heavy bourbon with a little bit of coffee and roasted malts. A little intimidating at first, even though you know this beer is about the bourbon - after a few sips, loving this aroma more and more.    T: Oh man, just an absolutely wonderful balance of a strong imperial stout with the deep, rich bourbon flavor. Not overbearing at all - bourbon here is better blended than Backwoods Bastard. Coffee, malts, some chocolate, this treat has it all.    F: Smooth, suprisingly medium for such a strong ABV brew, low but solid bitterness. Pretty clean, delightful sipper, whiskey doesn't linger.    O: This beer lives up to all of the expectations. Plus, it's a pretty tremendous value for what it is.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Original review (on 4/7/18, National Beer Day):    look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5    Smooth stout with strong notes of chocolate and coffee, weaker hints of bourbon, vanilla and oak. Nice dark almost-black color but not as rich or creamy as I was expecting. I was disappointed and expected a greater beer considering all the hype that surrounds KBS week every year. Surprisingly subtle mouthfeel.    Updated review (on 8/21/18):    Really wanted to give the famous KBS another try since I was disappointed the first time around - maybe I had a bad batch? Also saw the opportunity to try it on tap, and boy am I glad I did. Completely different experience! Great dark brown, almost black color with immediate great frothy tan head that slowly faded, along with some nice sheets of lingering lacing. Smells of dark coffee, chocolate and a little vanilla. Tastes of dark roast coffee, dark slightly bitter chocolate, molasses, vanilla, malt and a little caramel. Great bourbon oak undertones with some hints of sweetness. Smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel and just the right amount of carbonation. High ABV is well-hidden in this beer’s incredible flavor. Not too heavy or overpowering at all. I think this beer’s reputation is well-deserved and I’m convinced my original bottle of beer was just not right.

I was mostly surprised at how strong the taste and smell of bourbon was. Unfortunately bourbon is not my taste in beer too much . I liked the beer but I can’t say I loved it because of that. However for a bourbon breakfast stout I’d say this has to be one of the best and I’m rating it for what it is and not on my preference.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Pours a dark brown, almost black, color with a thick, two finger, light brown head that is slow to fade. Smell is bourbon, chocolate, coffee, malts, hint of herbal notes. Taste is vanilla, chocolate, oak, malt, with bourbon coming in at the end and a hint of heat at the finish. Creamy, medium-heavy feel. Really solid beer, maybe not quite up to the hype but I certainly would enjoy this whenever I got the chance so not far off.

L: black with a good dark head. It's frothy and delicious looking.    S: this smells great. You can pick up a bit of heat from a high alcohol content, dark chocolates, coffee, and bourbon.    T: oaky, with bourbon and chocolate. Lots of good roasted malts and some nice heat from the booze.    F: smooth, creamy, with light carbonation. Very pleasant.    O: worth the price, don't pay more than 25 a 4 pack though, and drink slowly. They really hit it this time.

An instant favorite.

The aroma is balanced throughout even as the beer warms. Dark would be an understatement of this stout’s color as no light escapes this pitch black beverage with dark lacing. Bourbon, oak, dark bitter chocolate, and dark roasted coffee flavors. The higher level of alcohol creates a bit of sweetness to complement the malt but not enough tgat id call thus a sweet stout at all. A note of a bitter dark chocolate lingers in the aftertaste alongside the bourbon flavor. Moderately full-bodied beer that seems a bit lighter due to the higher carbonation. Strong alcohol weaves itself into the numerous flavors throughout the beer but diesnt over power.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Lucky enough to catch a few 4-packs of 12-oz bottles, 2018 vintage. I don't know what all the hype is about... oh wait, yes I do. It's nothing less than entirely delicious and way too easy to drink quickly and frequently. On aggressive pour to a snifter, jet black and makes a tall, tight bubbly, mocha brown head. After a few minutes, the tight bubbles change to open cell, which eventually fade to a thin tan ring with lacing that stays. The nose is primarily dark chocolate, with a hint of coffee/espresso. First sips follow the nose, plus a tiny hint of bourbon. Mouthfeel is full, thick, with great lasting flavor. Alcohol is nowhere to be found, so drink carefully. No real hint of any hoppiness or acidity, just sweet and dark malt. Mellowness and drinkability reminds me of the 7-year aged DFH WWS, without the wait. Agree with other poster about stockpiling, if there's any left, is a good idea, especially considering how difficult it has been to score in my area at release...this year being an exception. A little more warming brings in more bourbon up front, then the coffee/espresso, with a chocolate linger. It disappeared too fast..a crushable stout! Just be home when you do that. I also scored two 2015 at Christmas, cellaring, which now seem at risk of being popped.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Breakfast Stout is already arguably my favorite beer, but I am not much of a "hunter", so I've failed to score KBS for years. Finally in 2018, I was at the right place at the right time and scored some.     KBS is that great Breakfast Stout beer turned up to 11. The coffee really came through for me and lingers, along with vanilla from the bourbon. There is a lack of booziness compared to what I'd expect from a bourbon barrel beer with this ABV. Even at $25.99 a 4-pack, I want to stockpile it.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Bottled 3/13/2018 ; 12.3% abv  Pours just short of black , with moderate, fine, creamy long-lasting tan head & lacing .    Smells of cocoa, (good!) black coffee, a little bourbon, and a hint of barrel char.    Flavor is bourbon, cocoa, bourbon, coffee, a little barrel tannin,and ending with a slight bit of bourbon "heat/flame", and light bitterness, that linger on the tip of the tongue. I see others lamenting lack of bourbon, but for me, I think I will probably like it better when that mellows & blends a slight bit more. Will have to revisit.    Feel is moderately thick/oily/creamy initially, then a little very fine carbonation prickle, that comes and goes 'til the end.     I don't have much to compare it to, as '16 was the first time I arrived in time to get it, gave away all but 1 bottle, and there was a heavy snowstorm in '17, & I only got there in time to get 1 bottle. As such , maybe that's why I'm not disappointed, as other regular imbibers of it seem to be, in their reviews/comments. :) [I.e., enjoy what's in your glass, that such wonders are in your glass,BAs. :)] That said, if I am remembering correctly, and I may not be, I liked '16 slightly better. Ratings are for '18.  Overall, very good ,and well worth it, IMHO . ($21.99/4pk)

Flavor wise, I was expecting to be blown away but there was no one thing that stood out. Solid BBA Stout flavor overall, however imo minimal chocolate, the coffee comes through a little bit. Especially with the hype around it, I was anticipating a killer beer, but did not live up to expectations for me. However, still a very solid beer that I would recommend to anybody at any day.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 2016 batch    Pour is that just shy of black dark brown that lets no light through. Wet brown head dissipates fairly quickly, but leaves some decent lacing as I sip on this.   Nose is actually pretty underwhelming. I'm not getting much... in general. There's some char and dark chocolate and coffee and a touch of booze which I attribute to the bourbon, but honestly it's all a lot more faint than I'd anticipated. Less 'subtle' than just low volume.  Flavour though... well. This salvages what was turning into a mild disappointment. A bold front of roast burns away quickly revealing acrid black coffee and bitter dark chocolate. A touch of oak, but only just a touch. After that crescendo the release is a long smoothe brown slope of creamy dark chocolate with flecks of coffee bean that carries through the finish and leaves the same lingering mouth coatin feeling of eating a bunch of high quality dark chocolate.  Decent amount of carbonation but only a medium body at best, the alcohol is folded in well and serves more to warm the belly than to burn the throat. Like, I KNOW that it's double digits ABV, but it's easy to forget.    KBS has an incredible reputation. Founders in general is well known for (among other things) having an unparalleled touch with dark grains. I am glad to (further) confirm both of these as true for myself.   Thanks to @WesMantooth, @FlintB, and @BullDoza for having sent me KBS in the various NBS BIFs in which we've been paired.

I pick up the malt sweetness then the coffee/chocolate comes in, bourbon tones, there is a little tart cherry, slight heat, some residual mallasses and bourbon that seems to linger with bitterness to balance out the finish. It has a soft smooth mouth to it, its slick and seems to disappear making you want more. This beer is smooth for how big it is, it has loads of character and flavor with a complexity that keeps you interested. Well done Founders, Cheers!!!!

Taste is great. I find that the balance between coffee and chocolate is difficult, but this is incredibly well balanced.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 2018 vintage drunk 3/10/18. Picked up at taproom today; this is fresh! Poured into same tulip glass as 2017 vintage.     Pour: same as 2017. Awesome!    Nose: lots of coffee, some more coffee, some dark chocolate, very, very slight bourbon. Maybe a little dark roast malt sweetness. Doesn’t seem as complex as in the past with bourbon and sweetness reduced from what I recall and my notes.     Taste: again, coffee and some more coffee. Very little booze, some caramel and toffee notes. Burnt toast, slight bitterness. Relatively clean. Surprisingly little bourbon compared to previous fresh vintages.     Mouthfeel: similar but maybe even creamier with less alcohol burn. Really thick and satisfying.     Overall: this is really good but maybe not as good as in the past. The lack of bourbon flavor is a negative for me while the other characteristics are solid. I love coffee so that is good. Would like more of the chocolate as in the past. Will try another bottle in a few weeks.     Numerical rating reflects the 2018 vintage. Prior vintages were higher.     ==========    2017 vintage poured into a tulip glass.     Pour: deep, dark, brown/black with a solid two finger tan head that only slowly dissipates leaving lots of lacing. The lacing lasts, and lasts. One of the most beautiful pours I’ve seen.     Nose: heavy malts, caramel, bourbon. The sweetness dominates with the bourbon well balanced. Not over powering; maybe more subtle than expected. Very pleasant.     Taste: creamy malts and bourbon hit first with hop bitterness right behind. Lots of coffee and dark chocolate. Some caramel and molasses provide a subtle sweetness, a hint of vanilla and dark fruits. Really well balanced with only the hop bitterness being a little more than I would want. Compared to fresh, the bitterness has mellowed and the bourbon is a little more subtle. Improves as it warms. I started at low 40s warming to low 50s. A really tasty treat.     Mouthfeel: creamy with bourbon coating the mouth. Mild carbonation, which makes the beautiful head even more impressive. The hops and alcohol linger a bit and, as with the flavor, maybe linger a bit to much and long. But that’s splitting hairs.     Overall: one of the best. This is a great sipper that improves as it ages. Keep a supply in the cellar. This was a year old and fabulous. I’ve had two year old and it is even better. Can’t wait to try three year old soon.

look: 3 | smell: 1 | taste: 2 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3 I just don't understand the hype around this beer.    I've tried it for two years in a row now at different stages. Last year it was super boozy and this year it's nothing more but a coffee bomb. All you can smell or taste is coffee. I'm not a coffee drinker so maybe that has something to do with it as well but I just don't think it's that great.    This year the ABV comes in at 12.3%. The positive is that it's beyond super smooth. There is no booze taste to it at all, but that's part of the problem for me. I want to smell the bourbon in it and it's just not there. Nothing but coffee. No chocolate or dried fruit either it's straight up coffee.    I can say I've given this more than a fair share and I'm just not impressed.    It's not a bad beer I suppose it's just not my thing and that's fine.

look: 3 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3.5 Let's review the highly sought after and hard to come by Founders KBS. Founders is a real hit or miss brewery. Some of there stuff is the best beer around town and some of it is downright dreadful to drink. That high abv is not perfectly hidden. Due to the barrel aging the coffee & chocolate have been flattened out. The bourbon is definitely there but it does not seem to be mixing well with the other adjuncts that they put in it. This is a big & boozy mess. This is interesting because their regular breakfast stout seems to always be a crowd pleaser in the fall & winter time. I don't see what the fuss is all about for this beer. For me this beer does not deserve the praise that it's receiving. Cheers! B-

You can immediately discern major differences, the biggest of which to me was that KBS has much more dark fruit flavor than BCBS, which really punches you in the face with huge smoke and chocolate flavors. I tend to prefer the smoke/char of BCBS but there are many who prefer the Founders flavor varieties (including my wife!). Either way, KBS is still a fantastic stout!!

The beer is an inky dark brown color and opaque. The head tatted lacing on the glass as it dissipated.     A bourbon bouquet leaps of the beer like an old geezer with a spring in its step. Furthermore, the aroma of the beer is vanilla, dark chocolate, rich roasted malt, dark roasted coffee, oatmeal, vino, wood, earthy, yeast, bread, raisins, stone fruit, molasses, alcohol, burnt sugar, caramel, and a touch of floral.     The flavor profile in this beer is dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, wood, bourbon, fruity esters, vino, bread, yeast, earthy, stone fruit, molasses, burnt sugar, caramel, floral, and oatmeal.     The body of the beer is creamy, chewy, and thick. The mouthfeel of the beer is full, medium carbonation, and full finish.     The bourbon flavors in the beer weave a delicate flavor profile with immense depth. A rich and complex beer in the flavor department. Outstanding would drink this beer over again.

The beer is a pitch black brew with a thinner dark brown crown. Resembles mocha. The crown doesn't stay around for as long as I thought it would. Just a couple of minutes and it only has an outer ring.   The smell is boozy and chocolately. Almost like a cocoa powder. After that it has hints of barrel and coffee.   The taste has the bourbon in the front, the chocolate in the middle and the barrel and coffee in the back. Very balanced. Nothing stealing one thing from the other but just showing different times to come in. Like a well rehearsed play.   The feeling is warm right off the bat, but not burning in any way. The chocolate and coffee coats the mouth as it goes through and stays, leaving you clearing your mouth absorbing all the flavor.   Overall, I love the consistency of this beer. They pull it off every year without too much different about it. They have what they want to achieve figured out and they also know how to pull it off, year after year.

Dark, dark brown with virtually no head or lacing (this probably has something to do with the age). Very strong aromas of coffee, coffee liqueur, and sweet oak. The palate is equally intense and quite boozy. Not enough dimensionality to really stand out for me.

I would type a just about perfect execution of the style, not to pad the stats but the consensus is correct. It was served in a snifter from the tap.

This is like that, only with charred espresso bean-flavored dark chocolate. Bottle date 02/21/17, poured into a glass goblet. This is, dare I say it, the color of a buckeye: deep, dark brown body, with an aggressive pour yielding a thick three-finger dark tan head. Big aromas and flavors of dark roasted malt, espresso bean, dark chocolate, and bourbon, with a little tart black cherry in the background. A little sweet, a little hot, and incredibly smooth, with no harsh bitter edge at all. Finish is quite dry for such a "heavy" beer, with just a hint of oaky astringence. World class in every respect, and well worth waiting in line for.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 2017 release.    I have been drinking these since April. I have had 12 oz. bottles, draft pours and did manage to get a 32 oz. growler back in May. From memory and notes I would definitely say this one was best fresh as some of the flavors have diminished slightly.     The oily near black body hasn't changed, nor has the thin swirling two tone mocha head. It still has visible legs of alcohol and leaves spots of lace on the side of the snifter.     The robust nose is still excellent, the chocolate now overpowers the bourbon and coffee and the oak seems to have disappeared. The alcohol is nearly absent.    The taste follows suit, chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and oak barrel flavors harmonize. The flavors have tailed off a little and aren't quite as synergistic as they once were but are still very balanced. The alcohol combines with the caramel malt to add a nice leaf tobacco burn. Full bodied and creamy this goes down almost too easy for an 11.8% Imperial Stout.

Watered down coffee, fizzy, a drain pour... and I loved the 2017 version! It smells okay a little bourbony but it is so thin in body and quite awful in taste that it had to go down the drain this year! Thankfully I had a Yeti on reserve.  Okay if you want to get a buzz I guess at 12.3% but in the taste and body they royally blew it this year. I mean really bad. Don't waste your money if you prefer a stout with some body and taste substance to it. Do spend $22 a 4 pack if you like a watery and barely bourbony and lacking substance beer.  The only substance this beer has is high ABV... there must be more than just High ABV to equal a beer worth buying for me. Cheers sorry if this disappointed anyone but being real.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottle Date: 2017  Palate Contaminants: other beer    The look is a down-the-middle dark brown with a very small amount of fine head.    The smell is dark malt and freshly ground coffee, very freshly ground. There's as much depth to that as anything I've had, not bitter at all. I get some desiccated fruit, as well, mostly non-sweet dates. Concentrated vanilla starts to show up as it warms.    The taste (for me) is raw cookie dough in the base. Some of the flavors (coffee and vanilla, namely) I often get in a brew, but there's a level of savoriness that I haven't run across before for those flavors. It has plenty of coffee, but there's also a slightly lactic sweetness. I keep getting close to saying bitter cocoa, but it keeps splintering into separate things, meaning I can never really pinpoint some sort of chocolate. Vanilla extract pervades the taste, and the level is very even throughout. I do get a little alcohol heat, but that's only because I was really paying attention to my first ever bottle. The only bitterness is on the back end, and it's slight.    The sweetness is lacking in the aftertaste, but there's lots of savory coffee left. It's very smooth with foamy carbonation, but I can get a little prickliness out of it.    As Darth Vader said, "Impressive. Most Impressive."

Nose is primarily vanilla, oak and of course bourbon boozyness with a long lingering damp musty forest. Dark toasted oak and bitter black coffee dominate at first with a brow rich earth. A sweet creamy vanilla bean icecream shines through the middle just briefly. More booze comes out at the end with dried leaves and cedar finishing surprisingly dry. Dried figs and plums are also present on the finish. Great balance of sweet and bitter, dry yet smooth. There was a lot of hype around this beer. It is delicious. Well crafted and well balanced with a ton of flavor.

Smells intensely of coffee, chocolate, vanilla and a hint of bourbon. Taste follows the nose, with amazing coffee, chocolate and vanilla flavours, complemented incredibly nicely by a subtle bourbon note. This has got an incredibly smooth and creamy full-bodyness to it, with really intense and well-balanced flavors. Even though this has almost 12% ABV, the slight boozyness is such a wonderful shade of bourbon that it doesn't feel unpleasant at all. Fantastic stuff.

This is an incredibly comforting beer. The booziness of the bourbon is warming without being overpowering. In every sip, KBS feels smooth and creamy with just enough carbonation. Despite the price, it's worth picking this one up at every opportunity.

Pours a thick oily black with minimal head, aroma of dark chocolate, coffee, hint of vanilla. Tastes of smooth coffee, chocolate with faint licorice, cherry and warming booziness.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 2016 edition    A: Poured into a snifter to a deep black topped by a finger and a half of dense dark tan head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass leaving minimal lacing  S: Smells of coffee, chocolate and roasted malts with a little caramel, vanilla and oak on the back end.  T: Taste is coffee up front followed by some bitter dark chocolate and roasted malts with a little charred wood. hint of burnt sugars as well. Good oak, caramel and vanilla with some slight sweetness. Swallow is more chocolate and coffee with some lingering barrel with more caramel and light vanilla.  M: This is a full bodied beer with a silky smooth and slightly creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is light but adequate and the beer has a drying finish.  O: Overall this beer is outstanding. The 11% ABV makes it a very drinkable beer. It has good flavors and great complexity which makes it a joy to drink. This is one worth seeking out.

Sits pitch black in the glass white a khaki ( light beige) head that leaves evidence of its presence in the glass and never fully dissipates   A: smells like breakfast, coffee, pancakes with syrup but not too much.   T: the taste follows the nose, coffee right up front bold astringency followed by light sweetness.   M: one of my favorite B.A stouts to drink.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours like oil. The head is moderate, quick-subsiding khaki with minimal lacing. Major props to the fact that this appears to warp surrounding spacetime with its utter black-ness. Also note: I didn't have to consult some yogi in the astral plane to acquire this beer as some below apparently did - this review is not coloured by 'wanting' to like it.    Aroma is coffee oils, baker's chocolate, and browned butter. Palette is deep, complex sweetness, recalling sticky toffee pudding with boozy raisins. The bourbon is mild, lending some rubber-ish heat that joins the bitter coffee to tame the decadence. Throaty heat increases as things settle.    Mouthfeel is smooth, but slightly thinner and more effervescent than what would be optimal for the taste. Denser head might help out here.    Overall, not as complex as some of the other big names, but that's not what it's aiming for. Founders succeeds at delivering cohesive, uncompromising, character-forward brews, and this is the pinnacle of just that.

Aroma – Coffee and chocolate. Coffee fades somewhat allowing a little bourbon to come through. Chocolate remains.   Head – Large (Maximum 5.7 cm, aggressive pour), brown, medium density froth, good retention, diminishing to an irregular four to seven mm creamy ring fed by gentle effervescence and a complete layer with a raised rocky hillock. No detached lacing.  Lacing – Not very good, but typical of BBA at the higher alcohol levels (11.8% ABV). Two columns of tiny to medium bubbles, connected to the receding ring.   Body – Dark brown/black, opaque.  Flavor – Alcohol, coffee, and chocolate. Some bourbon, particularly in the aftertaste. No hops, no diacetyl.  Palate – Medium, creamy, lively carbonation.    Impression: A very good BBA stout, although somewhat alcohol-forward. The chocolate and coffee are well balanced and hold their own against the alcohol. I found this very easy to get and ended up buying five or six cases, two for other people.    Appearance 4.25, Aroma 4.5, Flavor 4.5, Palate 4.5, Overall 4.5.

Pours a very dark brown with a brown head that dissipates quickly but not completely. The nose is chocolate covered cherries. Taste is chocolate, cherries, hints of bourbon, and very faint coffee notes on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium with a chalky, dry dry finish. I was expecting a heavier mouthfeel. Great beer. Definitely a sipper. I have another bottle and will age it for another year or two and see if I get some different flavors.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.75 First ever review. I picked up a four pack of the 2017 vintage back in June and this is my third time having this.     Look: Violent pour into a 16oz tulip produces a one-finger khaki head that sticks around for a minute or so. Color is black as the night, slight bubbles rising to the top.    Smell: Vanilla, bourbon, faint coffee.    Taste: Smooth chocolate and coffee up front, booze and oak on the end. Coffee lingers, especially as it warms up. A gorgeous melange of decadent flavors that makes this style so appealing to me.    Feel: This is where the 2017 loses points - it is too carbonated for me, with an effervescence that is distracting. However it is still thick and coats the tongue, though not as viscous as I'd like it to be on account of the bubbles.    Overall: I prefer the prior vintages of this that I've been fortunate enough to have (2015 and 2016) but it is still a premium BA stout. It's always nice to walk into a packy or gas station and be surprised to find this is available (though it doesn't happen very often!) - there is definitely something to be said in favor of widespread distribution, from time to time. Will be aging my last bottle for at least a couple years.

Definitely did not live up to the hype; I'll need to try from the bottle some time because the BA I was with said it was much less impressive on tap than from the bottle.    Edit: Had again on tap in late September and I was more impressed. Slightly adjusted ratings upwards.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I live in LA and for months I've been trying to track down a bottle of this. Well, I couldn't believe my eyes when I stumbled across a 2016 release at a craft beer store on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, Brazil! It cost the equivalent of $17 for one 12-oz shorty, but I couldn't pass it up.  Poured jet black, viscous, into a small glass, yielding a small tan head without much retention. The aroma is of roasted espresso beans as well as some more raw and assertive wet coffee grinds, warm dried fruits such as raisins and dates, bitter dark chocolate, cinnamon, burnt caramel and other roasted and toasted dark malts, some booze, oak. Not the most aromatic stout I've had, but inviting nonetheless. Taste is of all of the above, with the roasted espresso and the bittersweet toasted caramel malts dominating, with bitter chocolate and some barrel character and booze. Thick and resinous body, mouth coating, some alcohol burn present, with a long finish that it is a bit bitter, mainly from the malts.  Comparing similar-ABV imperial stouts, I'd say this is slightly better than AleSmith Speedway Stout in its complexity, but I'd put the 16%-ABV Avery Tweak on a bit higher level. Still, this is incredibly well crafted.

Sugar in the raw? Subtle.     T-Coffee. Baking/unsweetened chocolate. Charcoal/smoke. Vermouth. A teensy bit of bourbon, but I keep comparing this to Bourbon County and it's nowehere near as aggressive.    Feel-thick, oily, minimal carbonation; almost seems flat. Dry at the end. A tiny bit of heat, but nowhere near as much as Bourbon County Stout. I love big thick syrupy stouts, but just personal taste, I like a bit more carbonation.    Overall: Not to keep comparing this to the famous Bourbon County Stout, but good god, this is exponentially easier to drink. Bourbon county makes me feel like I'm drinking 16 ounces of straight bourbon, it's so aggressively boozy. This is a fantastic, subtle, barrel-aged stout, with just enough kick/heat to let you know it's been in a barrel and is 11%, but just barely.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2017 release. Dark like a stout should be, modest amount of mocha colored head that faded a little quicker than I thought it would but left a nice ring of foam along the sides. Not much lacing. Smells delicious...of coffee, bitter chocolate, maybe a hint of cinnamon. The bourbon and coffee really come through in the taste, chocolate is a bit muted but is definitely noticed in the aftertaste and a bit on the boozy-side. Very easy drinking despite the booze. Definitely a top notch beer. I don't drink many stouts, but when I do I find them to be pretty enjoyable. Will be saving my remaining ones for the colder weather.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Tasted from bottle. Black in color with a dark brown head. Incredible aroma of chocolate, coffee, caramel, oak, molasses. Taste is a mixture of dark chocolate and coffee with slight smokey notes. Very smooth and hides the high ABV incredibly well. Full bodied with a sticky heavy mouthfeel at first giving way to a dry feeling. Taste really lingers on palate. This and Bells Expedition are the 2 best stouts I've had. Very very well done.

This is definitely a "sipper" and in small amounts. It's one of those beers that is hard to find, and when I found it on tap, it was a surprise. The server poured it in a 20 oz. Imperial Pint glass! Perhaps did not know "what" was being poured? Either way, 20 oz. was a HUGE amount of THIS beer. Very happy to finally taste this "unicorn" and was impressed with everything about this delicious stout.

Real nice, very well balanced, and a pleasant surprise to find it on tap today!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Pours black with a long lasting half inch dark chestnut head that leaves a coating of lace on a tulip glass.    The aroma opens with coffee and mild bourbon against a dark chocolate background. Light vanilla comes out with warmth as the coffee aromas intensify.    The flavors pick up where the aromas left off, adding sweet fruity flavors. Bourbon diminishes with warmth, but is always quite present. The finish is long and mild.    Alcohol, while as strong as expected, is far from hot. The body is thick and smooth with a soft cotton texture. Carbonation is well suited.    This is an excellent sipping beer. I enjoyed it with conversation over lunch at the Village Tavern and found it to be well worth the years of anticipation.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Maybe this is an off-year, but I really don't see the hype. It's a tasty stout, dominated by coffee, chocolate, and vanilla flavours, without being too sweet. But there's just not the kind of depth or complexity of flavour that would justify a 100/100. (I don't taste the barrel-aging at all, for instance.)

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Beautiful opaque obsidian. Black as night. Thin tan head that dissipates quickly. Smell has wonderful chocolatey, pruney, coffee notes but is dominated by a booziness that is a little overbearing on my nose. Taste is much more balanced, figs and chocolate, oak and bourbon, big and bold but not so boozey as the nose would hint. Very nice bourbon barrel stout. Incredibly clean on the palette for such a big beer. Certainly fills the tongue, leaving no taste bud idle, but also clears out in a respectable time and gives the impression that you could drink a couple of these without getting syrup mouth. Overall a very good bourbon barrel stout, but seems to me to be a bit less balanced than it used to be (this is the 2016 release). May be just that it's been some years since I had it and my palette has changed but the nose seems much boozier now and the taste seems more bitter. Great brew though if you're looking for a big stout.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Pours like a thick black ice cream float. Even the thick head looks like chocolate mousse.     Smells like dark chocolate espresso cake with rum or of course bourbon. Basically a chocolate covers espresso beam Lots of wood from the oak.     Taste is incredible. Many many stages and it just goes on forever slowly warming along the way. Sweet chocolate and brandy notes up front. Vanilla bean. Plenty of espresso. Sweetness stays on the palate as a more dry bitter dark chocolate flavour takes over the middle. Actually a decent amount of Bitter coffee and earthiness. Later on some oak lingers. Warms the throat a bit. Actually as it warms a bit of tobacco comes out.     Mouthfeel is amazing. So much body. Like an chocolate mocha ice cream float. A bit of tingly carbonation keeps it just fresh feeling enough.     First time trying and as good as I've heard. Id call it a Dessert beer over a breakfast one. Should have bought more than one. Very pronounced and genuinely "natural" tasting flavours yet still so well balanced with everything clearly distinguishable.

It turned up at Hungry Brew Hops in Newmarket, Ontario a couple months ago. Sorely tempted to get it but the $18 price tag for a 355 mL bottle just seemed too steep. Fortunately it arrived at the local LCBO in Hamilton for $7.25. Couldn't wait to get this one into a glass! Slightly chilled it and poured it into a snifter.  L: Pours a jet black with an inch of brown foam that dissipates quickly.  S: Enticing smell with coffee predominating. Notes of mocha, licorice and some bourbon.  T: Wow! Superb. Coffee, chocolate, licorice, boozy (got that bourbon burn going on). A joy to sip and sort through the complex flavour profile.  M: Viscous, chewy and dry.  O: Stellar beer. Wish I could get a reliable supply for this one. The taste and feel hangs together so well. Worth the hype.

Very pretty beer to drink.    very smooth taste .Dark Chocolate ,vanilla, bourbon. Those are all top notch complex flavor profiles .    savoriness level is great.    I opened this beer expecting to be disappointed. 2017 release sat on the shelves at my local and seemed like a fall off from previous years. To me it tasted aged or overly mellowed already upon release. Now it just the same solid beer it has been over the years, smoother maybe.  Buy as much as possible rating increased. Founders is great.

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 From a 355ml bottle served at 11 degrees Celsius into a snifter. The beer warmed up to room temperature during consumption. Best by date: 20.12.2017. 11.9% ABV confirmed.    Look: It's like pouring used engine oil out of a bottle. An opaque black with .5cm of mocha head that basically has no retention. A partial film is formed on top of the beer after it quickly dissipates. Poor retention which comes as no surprise for such high ABV beer. Some lacing.    Smell: Bam! Strong, sharp, rich, and complex. The beer hits you with a massive range of dark, roasted malts with slightly burned notes of coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, licorice, tobacco, and restrained bourbon. Faint alcohol note.    Taste: Bam! Like a sledgehammer. Strong (read intense) and bitter. Major notes are roasted malts (borderline charred), chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. I'm also detecting some dark fruit, tobacco, licorice, and caramel. The finish is long, strong, and the bourbon really comes through here.    Feel: Full body and mild carbonation. Heavy, thick, and slightly chewy with mild astringency and restrained alcohol warmth.    Overall: Big, bold, complex, and harmonious. Wonderfully balanced displaying excellent craftsmanship. World class and a must-try. My favourite bourbon barrel-aged beer so far. I think the beer lives up to the hype, however I'm left wondering how much I've been affected by it and to what extent does the hunt and the price tag have an effect. I suppose in any case you should grab a bottle if you can.

This has been on my beers to try for 3 and a half years so I made sure to stock up. Still can barely believe its in Canada. Best before December 2017. I believe this is most recent vintage and advertised at 11.9% ABV. A fine way to conclude the Canada Day weekend.    Appearance - dark, dark brown, nearly black ominous. Capped with a finger and a half of frothy tan head. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Good if not quite great head retention.    Smell - dark chocolate and secondarily coffee to an extent I have rarely experienced. Vanilla shines through too with something akin to marshmallow as it warms. The bourbon starts showing up in copious quantities as the beer gets closer to room temperature. Effing phenomenal. Quite possibly the best nose on a beer ever. If not then in my lifetime which is good enough for me.    Taste - chocolate and creamy with some vanilla, plenty of bourbon as well. Bold flavors throughout, but the flavors ramp up a couple notches of intensity as it warms. Complex with lots of roasty notes and some bitterness, yet enough sweetness and richness to be a dessert beer on its own. At times can finish a little hot and boozy.    Mouthfeel - smooth, voluptuous, dense and heavy. Well carbonated, yet easy enough to drink on a summer's night. Flavours stick, but not cloying and the beer has enough balance to make this the truth.    Overall - as the label reads KBS is a very different beer than the breakfast stout. While it doesn't put out just incredible intense (coffee) flavor, it puts out many, culminating in a delicious dessert beer that's just fine on its own. While possibly not quite as good as the original, still an incredible beer worth all the praise it has ever received. Worthy of the hype!

BBS have been a favorite of mine for awhile now. So far, THIS ONE TAKES THE CAKE! My current favorite beer, the best beer to have touched these lips. Now for the 5 star review.    Drinking out of a snifter from a 12oz bottle.    A: Jet black and when poured little to no head    S: Chocolate, Chocolate, slight vanilla, coffee, coffee    T: Dark roast, cold pressed coffee mixed with alcohol, semi-sweet milk chocolate, a little heavy cream, then chilled, shaken, and strained. Carbonation is noticeable, but doesn't interfere with the greatness of the beer.     M: Somewhat syrupy, snifter gets kinda sticky by the end of the beer which is expected from this type of beer.    O: The is a glorious BBS! It hits all the flavors, smells, and meets the ABV levels that I like in this style of beer. If you haven't tried it, IT'S A MUST TRY!

The smell has some bourbon up front with coffee, chocolate and oak coming through to try and combine with the bourbon but still stays secondary, vanilla only comes out as it warms. The taste is slightly sweet, but burnt/roasty/smokiness of sorts goin’ on, vanilla comes out again but subdued, hmmm...yes a bourbon aftertaste and finish. On the palate, its pretty heavy, yet smooth and rich, not sessionable (nowhere close, not sure why I had two of these tonight, but I know I’m goin’ to bed after this), boy oh boy that ABV is felt [the heat is there], carbonation is adequate. Overall, this is smooth, wow, what a nice mouthfeel, I can see why so many people absolutely love this.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Will it live up to the hype? Been sitting on this one for a few months... bottle dated 2/23/17.    Poured into a snifter. Black as oil with a half finger dark tan-brown head. Most of it dissipates fairly quickly but it lines the edges until the final chug.    Aroma is coffee, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, molasses. Sweet yet savory. Loads of chocolate but you can easily appreciate all of the the aromas as well.    Taste is rich chocolate. So rich. Just a deep bourbony, chocolaty blend of flavor. Sweet but not cloying.     Feel is heavy, lightly carbonated, smooth, and creamy.    Overall, the most balanced BA stout I have ever had. No one flavor dominates-- the coffee, chocolate, and bourbon all shine through in the just the right amounts. Perhaps just a tiny bit too boozy but honestly this beer is difficult to criticize.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Another beer fallen into the depths of hype hell.     While this is a decent beer, it is not by any means worth its price and its scarcity.     Founders breakfast stout kills KBS in my opinion.

Aromas consist of the same aspects of the taste. The flavors are off the charts! Packed full of espresso, dark and milk chocolate, caramelized sugar, vanilla, and baked bread. The feel is warm, smooth, with a full body and medium carbonation.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Really nice, good woody bourbon smell an beautiful malt character, so mellow and smooth. Not really mind blowing enough to warrant 100 rating IMO. Still a very good beer and glad I got to try it though.    *********************************2017 revisit... i am guessing they do it pretty much to the same recipe each year, this year I seemed to get a bit more of a savoury, dare I say Vegimitey, element in there. Upped my taste rating accordingly.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.75 Picked up at Stagecoach Liquors in Newbury Park, CA. 2016 release, bottled on 2/11/2016. 12.4% ABV. 12oz bottle.    Look: Pours a beautiful jet black. Very small head of dark tan foam. Very thin, quickly dissipating lace.  Smell: Overwhelming coffee hits you initially. It is quickly met by an amazing sweet chocolate that perfectly balances the initial coffee bitterness. An evidence of toasty caramel malts plays with the back of your nose.  Taste: Again, you're met first with a great bitter coffee. A sweet boozy warmth comes next, with a subtle breadiness and more of a dark chocolate feel.   Feel: While it pours very thick, the mouthfeel was surprisingly thin with a much stronger carbonation than I expected! While you don't get too many hints that this beer is 12.4% from the taste, you feel that bourbon burn in your stomach right away and get a nice stickiness with each sip. A smooth beer, even with that surprisingly high carbonation. It also does thicken as it warms.     Overall this beer is fantastic as I predicted it would be. Coffee dominates the profile , but with a great balance from the chocolate, caramel, and booze. This beer had such incredible hype that nothing short of perfect would have lived up to it. It definitely nears the top of my stout lists, however if in my opinion I'd place Alesmith's Speedway Stout and North Coast's Old Rasputin IRS slightly ahead of it. But 100% worth trying if you come across it.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 12oz bottle, shared by a shitty (sorry, 'know it all') random at rogerdandy's latest typically epic bottle share, while I monitored everyone's frolicking spawn in the backyard, because, y'know.    This beer pours a solid black hole, with two flabby fingers of medium brown head, which leaves some scattered island chain lace around the glass as it slowly sinks away.    It smells of pungent Bourbon barrel notes - bittersweet cocoa powder, cafe-au-lait, grainy and roasted caramel malt, black licorice, and a further barely-restrained oaken booziness. The taste is bready and doughy caramel malt, some free-range ashiness, bitter coffee, still heady Bourbon (the barrel and the whiskey therein), milk chocolate, anise candies, and a weak earthy, leafy, and perfumed floral hoppiness.    The carbonation is quite average in its meek-ass frothiness, the body a decent middle-heavyweight, and dead, dead smooth, with a nice, full and rounded creaminess, to boot. It finishes in a sweet confectionery and saucy, southern Bourbon manner, if I do say so myself.    Overall, this is certainly a stellar big-boy brew, with lots and lots of the promised and expected flavours, while not disappointing in the least. Totally worth sampling or imbibing deeply should one get the opportunity at a later date. We shall see, we shall see.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottled February 2017 poured into a teku at 55 degrees 11.8% ABV. The beer is black with no light passing through. The head is light brown and leaves significant lacing. The aroma is coffee and black chocolate with a hint of bourbon and oak. The taste is an even mix of dark chocolate, coffee and malt with nice bourbon barrel flavor on the end. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium to lowly carbonated and balanced in terms of bitterness. Overall, great. This is a case study in balance. At no point does this become a boilermaker that tastes like stout with a shot of cheap bourbon. Recommended if you're a fan of the style.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pour looked thick, almost like oil coming from the bottle. A very vigorous pour yielded a finger of thick tan head that turned into a ring fairly quickly.  Nose for me was predominantly a dark chocolate, not much of the bourbon barrel I was hoping for from a highly acclaimed brew.  Taste followed, lots of dark chocolate. I drank this one slowly, let it warm but never really got the barrel presence I was hoping for. Maybe a little hint of coffee.  Mouthfeel was nice, thick and almost oily. That chocolaty flavor lingered.   Overall a tasty brew but not quite living up to the hype to me, maybe I expected more going into it than I should have but I have a few bottles sitting to try again another day.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 2015 Bottle    A: Moderate chocolate, lightly sweet malt, followed by coffee with light vanilla and bourbon notes.    A: Black color, opaque, with a thin tan head that quickly dissipates into a thin ring around the glass.    T: Moderate chocolate upfront, followed by a moderately light coffee, lightly sweet malt, with faint vanilla and bourbon character and moderately light roast bitterness on the finish.    M: Full bodied with moderately light carbonation. There is some alcoholic warmth, but the extended aging mellowed the sharper notes.     O: Super tasty; the beer has a great chocolate, coffee character that's well complemented by the vanilla and bourbon barrel. It's a big beer, but drinks a little thinner, than other Imperial Stouts.
