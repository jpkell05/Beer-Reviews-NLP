look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Another beer that I've had many, many times in the past but hadn't bothered to review here until now.    Rich golden color, fairly good clarity with a very slight haze. Pours a a rocky white head, creamy and lingering.    A rich and complex hop aroma. Elements of typical citrus and pine, but nothing overpowers. A bit malty sweet as well    Flavor starts slightly sweet with a citrus hop flavor, and hop flavor dominates throughout. Has a gradual transition towards a bitter finish - not a sharp break toward bitter. But the drying bitter finish comes through strongly in the end.     Medium body and carbonation. Not astringent despite the hop bitterness    This beer has never seemed as special to me in bottled form (as this sample was). Aspects of the hop flavor come through better in the draft version, which I definitely prefer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Always enjoyed this IPA on tap or for a hop fix, back in the day. Surprised I'd never reviewed it so, after Dry January and now craving some hops -- here goes.    Poured into my Libbey Imperial Pint. Bottled-on date of 12/11/18 -- so not terribly old.    L -- Clear, deep gold with a white head that pours very dense and holds up well, leaving nice lacing as it slowly settles.    S -- Pine resins up front. Vague biscuit malts fighting to be recognized.    T -- Same pine resins up front in the flavor, if not as harsh as in the nose. Lightly sweet biscuit malts balancing out the hops nicely. Bitter resins rounding out the finish and aftertaste. Light citrus notes at the very finish of the drink.    F -- Mouthfeel is soft to crisp with a light-medium body.    O -- While I wish there was more malt character in the nose, and maybe more citrus esters in the flavor, that's just my preferences in an IPA. There's no mistaking what's in your glass with this beer, and it's very well made.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 It's not the best IPA. It is very hoppy. Maybe I just don't like the hoppy being that bitter. But even other IPAs that are more bitter don't leave this stale aftertaste. It's not all horrible... But maybe the name hints at the fact that it is made quickly and with low grade . It says it has over 60 hop additions over a 60 minute boil... maybe that's why it is so hoppy. But Im just not a big fan. I think it could be better. Maybe the beer im drinking right now has just been sitting on the shelf too long. who knows. I'd buy again if i had a choice between miller or keystone, but it isn't the best IPA I've ever had. If i want a really hoppy bitter beer Id drink loose cannon.   Michael Overzat   Precision Digital Media   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 I am not a big IPA fan. I don't like too much pine or grassy notes. This is more mild hops and citrus and a bit of malt for balance. I would drink again.

APPEARANCE: pours a clear, copper color with two-fingers off-white head that slowly dissipated until a thin, unbroken layer of small bubbles remained, there is significant lacing on the glass, medium carbonation.    SMELL: initially bread and pineapple.    TASTE: initially bread and pineapple citrus, there is an earthy note on the finish.     PALATE: Medium body and carbonation.    OVERALL: this is a great looking IPA but the taste is just average, this is a good IPA but I would not seek it out again.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Truly a wonderful IPA that is well done through and through.   To be honest, I dont like the presentation of the label. Its a little cheap looking and for a long time I never bought this beer because of that. Luckily, the reputation it has in the beer community far exceeds its looks. First let's talk about the aroma. Nice bright citrus and pine aroma with a tail end of malt. The smell reminds me of grapefruit and maybe some pineapple or mango. The taste complements the aroma. Upfront you get a bright fruity start. A tad bit of sweetness but mostly a mango, pineapple and grapefruit tartness that lends perfect to the style. The middle of the sip has all the Malt backbone and bold richness and exits your pallet with a buildup of pine and citrus hop notes. Damn near perfect for a IPA. The feel is crisp, clean and refreshing. This IPA is smooth with a medium body and semi dry finish. I think this a well done beer and whold highly recommend you try it.

Tastes of sweet caramel malt. A little spice, but otherwise not much hop presence. A decent ale, but doesn't really feel like an IPA.

It's complex, fruity citrusy and well balanced. The 90 minute can fix you if you'd like more substance; but this one is a nice beer all around. Doesn't overwhelm but doesn't need to. And beside me, this is the best stuff to come out of Delaware.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 From notes 8/23/14: Pours a clear pale gold producing 3+ fingers of off-white, finely bubbled, foamy, lasting head that leaves motes and blotches of lacing. Aroma is sweet with hop notes of pine and citrus backed by caramel malt and something floral and candy sugar like. It is heavenly hoppy from mid-sip into the aftertaste. Taste is more balanced than its 90 minute sibling. Starts sweet and finishes bitter-sweet with a dry, peppery finish. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with moderate-high carbonation; peppery bite, lightly chewy, finishing dry with an astringency lasting deep into the aftertaste.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A: Pours a thick head. Color of straw and almost completely clear if not for a few carbonation bubbles. Incredible lacing.    S: Grassy, oily, piney, floral hops. Maybe some citrus.    T: Smooth with a hop nose. A decent IBU is present throughout. Some sweetness and finishes clean like most dogfish head beers.    O: Pretty good IPA. Balanced, but has enough of the hop hit you want from an IPA.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Rating beer will obviously always be a subjective endeavor, that being said, this is a fine IPA.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA - 6% - 60 IBUs  Date: 08/28/18, tasted on 09/17/18.   Appearance: Clear and bright straw yellow with a finger of white head.  Aroma: Wonderful assorted hop aromas, a bit of sweet but light malts, and some resiny spice notes. There are also grassy aromas and a light dankness.   Taste: Big crisp and clean hops flood the palate, though the bitterness remains relatively low. The malts are more apparent on the taste than they were on the nose, but they never get in the way and thankfully allow the hops to shine. Speaking of the hops, they are a very pleasant mixture of pine, lemon, and a small amount of pineapple. The malt profile is more along the lines of saltine cracker to very light toast. The finish leans more toward dry and is very clean, leaving only a brief residual bitterness.   Biased comments: Light, but full of flavor, 60 Minute is a beer applicable to almost any occasion. I actually prefer this lighter and dryer beer to 90 Minute, which ins’t a bad beer, just overly sweet and malty.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Brilliant and clear golden body topped with a thick, sculpted head. A crisp and mildly sweet malty aroma, suggestive of crystal malt; some ester floating in the background. Light grain base flavor with some fairly aggressive hop bitterness throughout the taste; a bit herbal with a lingering hop presence. Medium body; crisp and slightly dry on the palate.     A solid IPA bringing a pleasing look with a well-balanced and decently complex malt and hop combination to the palate.

Thick slightly off-white head with very good retention and great lacing. This is what a beer should look like.    S---Sweet & hoppy. Citrus, grapefruit.     T---Malt shows up to balance the hops. Grapefruit is predominant. No bitterness to speak of.    F---Slightly resinous/sticky. Mostly smooth & welcoming.     O---A classic that has perhaps been surpassed, but is still excellent and a touchstone for the style. It has never disappointed.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 12 Oz Bottle poured into a glass. First time trying a beer from this company.  Look - mostly clear golden light amber color. A couple inches of foam slowly fades, great lacing on glass  Smell - very sweet aroma like a cake almost. Pick up a waft of alcohol and then the hops as well. Fairly tropical layers to the hops..mango, clementine, figs.  Taste - Oily, resinous hop profile mixes well with a very sweet malt backbone. It is very standard tasting for the style but it tastes very smooth and clean, no extreme bitterness or funky flavors. Nice mellow, easy to drink and only moderately carbonated. Hops are more piney/grapefruit than in the aroma but the layer of tropical sweet fruit is still there. I will say the bitterness does seem to linger on the palate more than most IPA's    Overall, an excellent product. Easy to drink a few of these, not egregiously filling. It doesn't try and do too much which i think is fine. Can't nitpick it too much, i give this beer an A-

Just the right amount of bitterness that hits you in the aftertaste.

look: 4.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Bottled 6/7/18, consumed 7/17/18    L: Beautiful crystal clear golden amber with a nice big head that left a good amount of lacing.    S: On the mild/light side - piney, grassy, danky hop notes prominent with some grapefruit citrus and sweet malt notes as well.    T: Pretty much follows aroma exactly, a basic pine-forward old school WC-IPA. Unremarkable.    F: Medium, good carbonation, solid bitterness, again old school WC-IPA in every way.    O: A once-great IPA from long ago that can only be classified as solid & decent now.

FWIW tasted this beer After the mighty Sierra Nevada Hop Hunter IPA. So..Very mediocre muted dank smell and taste for an IPA. Cardboard aftertaste. Need to try a fresher bottle from a different retailer that doesn't nuke its perishable stock? Sam switch over to cans.

Very good lacing.    S - Very citrusy. A lot of orange, with a little lemon and MAYBE a hint of grapefruit. Not a lot of hops. Smells very light.    T - More hops in the taste than smell, but still not a lot oh hops. Very orange. well balanced.    F - Fairly carbonated, but very smooth. Goes down extremely easy.    O - Quite good. I wish there was a little more hops in the taste, but is definitely a beer you could sit down and drink multiple in a row. Goes down easy and tastes good too.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 My rating is based on bottled or draft versus canned. I do taste a difference with canned although all are acceptable examples. 60 minute is a great microbrewery beer that is middle of the road affordable, with adequate alcohol, bitterness, floral and fruity to appeal to everyone except people who hate ipas all together. I love 60 minute as it’s very well balanced and not a hit you in the face ipa like most Troeg ipas and others. I would say it’s slightly better than a laguinitas ipa (before the Heineken takeover) as it has better balance and hops. Laguinitas being more floral. As I am a person with a penchant for more alcohol, feel free to chase down 90 minute and 120 minute...just remember that both the taste and bitterness are widely different and 60 minute will have much broader party appeal.

More malty, caramel than I had experienced along with a more funky, “dark” earthy hop taste.     Now that I’m really enjoying fruity, zesty dry hopped lighter ales, when I went back to 60 min. I was a bit underwhelmed. Just different as our palates change. Still great, just not my favorite.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Some people might think this a standard or boring IPA but it's my go to beer. It gets the hoppiness to drinkability just right so you can drink a couple if you choose. I love other IPAs as well, but too much hops blows out my palate and too few is bland. This beer is the middle porridge.

Taste: A delayed impact of bittersweet citrus and that same pine scent. Another wave of bitter hops washes over your tongue as you swallow. Surprisingly balanced for an IPA.    Mouthfeel: Medium body that thickens out to cover the otherwise high carbonation.    Overall: I'm still not an IPA guy, but this isn't bad.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Clear golden color with lots of visible carbonation. Just over two fingers of white haed made of larger bubbles that collapsed into a thicker version of a finger plus of white head.    Smells very tropical like pineapple. A hint of pine and a hint of that hops mustiness.    Taste is slightly bitter mid tounge. Gets a bit sweeter before finishing with a nice hoppy bite at the back of the mouth right at the top of the slide down the throat. Up front is a bit of tingling sweetness.    Mouth feel leans toward medium but has a fairly dry finish. Almost like the hops snap it off at the back end of the mouth. Does leave a bit of stickiness in the back of the throat.    A very nicely balanced IPA that showcases all aspects of the beer, malts and hops working together in near perfect harmony. An easily drinkable beer that lets you know that it is more than just a slam it beer. You should take the time to enjoy this yet a person could easily drink a couple of them at once. And not an overly bitter beer at that. Nice job Dogfish Head!

This one is poured from a 19.2 oz can, with the appearance of a “yellow beer”. Bonus points for a nice rocky head that lingers. Smell is very subtle. Taste is old school IPA - bitter and dank with hints of citrus, pine, and grass. Malt focuses on the low lovibond flavors of cracker and very light biscuit. I like that as it lets the hops really cone through. It’s a well-balanced beer, but not as bright and fruity as modern Pale ales. Yet, this is a classic that is still distinctive and holds up well.

look: 2.25 | smell: 2.25 | taste: 2.25 | feel: 2.25 | overall: 2.25 When I first got into craft beer about 7 years ago this was one of them & I actually liked it. The maltiness and hop profile were a winning combination. There was a beautiful balance there.Back then this original dogfish head 60 minute IPA would have gotten at least a B score from me. Now that I am revisiting this in 2017 and the first thing I notice is different label art. That is okay you know no big deal, but it does not taste like how a dogfish head 60 minute IPA should taste like. They have changed up the hop profile and the taste has gone downhill. It's both overly grapefruity and too earthy tasting. Where is the malts to match this hop profile. Stop trying to compete with other breweries because your just ruining your flagship beers. This is not okay tasting and if you think it is then you probably enjoy drinking a 6 pack of watered down filled corn syrup like keystone ice as well. Cheers! C-

The flavor was of citrus and pine - love those Oregon hops! The feel overall is mixed. I drank three of them between 5:30 p.m. (after dinner) and 8 o'clock, all while eating popcorn and watching a movie. At first they were quite good; however, come 3 a.m. I had such flatulence that I had to get out of bed and drink some milk. Not what I expected from a well-regarded name in craft beer.

I detected no hint of pine or citrus that is typical of IPAs upon taking a big whiff. Upon sipping there was absolutely no detectable trace of hop character. What I got was a smokey malted taste followed by butter very reminiscent of a porter mixed with an English ale. Very disappointed that I had purchased a six pack. Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA is much better at this price point. Honestly this is the kind of effort I would expect from Anheuser Busch.

After running down the entire list of macro swill, she said, "Dogfish..." I said I'd have that. Turned out to be 60 Minute. Typical restaurant pour: standard pint glass, minimal head. Slightly hazy amber color, with a white head (what there was of it). Absolutely wonderful aromas and flavors of pine and citrus, with notes of tropical fruit and light caramel. Very well balanced, with a solid malt backbone to support the hop bitterness. Medium bodied, clean finish. This is one fantastic beer!

BUt I digress.     Appearance - Pours a nice, slightly cloudy golden color with a slim finger of soapy white head that dissipates rapidly but leaves some lacing.     Smell - Citrus, grass, picked up a lot of malts though. Could be well-balanced. Very excited about it    Taste - Much more malty than I originally expected! I really enjoy it, very well-balanced. Malty up front, hoppy in the middle. A nice hoppy bitter to it.    Mouthfeel - A crisp, bitter finish. Clean as a whistle. Really enjoy it!    Overall - This is an excellent beer, I would highly recommend it. I am really looking forward to the 90 Minute variation that I have in my fridge as well.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 I liked the new label.  Amber color with a thick head with great retention and leaving lots of laces.  Nice piney aroma with notes of lychees, stone fruit, a bit of caramel and dough.  Flavor with notes of stone fruit, pine, grapefruit citrusy, lychees, caramel and biscuit malt, spices, melon and tangerines. Dry and bitter aftertaste.  Medium body with appropriate carbonation.  This American IPA is original and elegant with lots of white fruits, citrusy and piney notes. Its bitterness is very flavorful and not harsh at all. I couldn’t resist to wash down their reliable six-pack.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Decanted from 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into 16 oz plastic conical pint at Dagger John's in Bronx, NY.  A: Pours a very slightly hazy, light copper color with a, no more than quarter inch head and minimal lacing, although the "glass" may have contributed.   S: Aromas of lemon citrus, caramel, and pine. Maybe a whiff of tutti-fruity at points.   T: Tastes of caramel malt subsumed by citrus: lemon, grapefruit, and tangerine all present. Relatively light bitterness in excellent balance with overall flavor profile.   M: Light to medium bodied with moderate to strong carbonation. Crisp and clean finish.  O: This is a go to EC IPA. Clearly less complex than the 90 minute or all day versions, but very drinkable. I would not hesitate to order/drink/serve/share.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12oz bottle, red wine glass, bottled 10/11/17.     My glass is a glowing copper orb, lightly hazed. The head is unimpressive.     Citric aroma with a bitter edge and caramel malt underneath. There’s some papaya and melon.     Sweet juicy malt with good buzzy citrus hopping. Oranges, lemons, and grapefruits are all represented. The finish is lightly bitter and gives us a nice biscuit note to chew on.     Initially the feel is like crisp like plate glass underfoot. As it warms things become slightly soapy, but can still be called clean.     60 Minute is a good example of the East Coast style before it developed. I appreciate that it’s not too sweet and the biscuit note helps set it apart. It’s hopping is more one dimensional than the fruity, juicy, super hazy NE IPAs so popular now.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 12oz bottled 9/25/17 poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 6% ABV. The beer pours bright golden orange amber in color with a thick, sticky, nearly white head. Retention and lacing are above average. The aroma is citrus leaning more toward orange or lemon. The taste is semisweet caramel up front with a lemony, earthy slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is thin bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. Finishes with an almost tea-like feel. Overall, very good. A good reference for what was ground breaking 15-20 years ago on the east coast.

S- Piney and grassy (EARTHY) hops followed by a peppery/rosemary-like aroma. Phenolic in a sense with a touch of lemon and caramel.  T- The right amount of bitterness that is followed by an almost spicy peppery note? Sweet caramel follows, as well as a malty sweet body. Lemon zest is present. Very nice, and unexpectedly mellow.  F- Thin and crisp  O- There is no question that there are too many ipa styles to know which is the best. But this "East Coast" ipa as it is labeled seems to have a very unorthodox mellowness to it's flavor palette; which brings me to say that it is very intriguing. Is this the best beer I've had from the style? Not by a long shot. But it is extremely pleasant and as always a well crafted beer by DogfishHead. The flavor can be too mellow though, and can certainly come off as watery because of that. It also seems like it is lacking depth, which in turn leads me to say that this is a very GOOD ipa.

F: Smooth to thin with small amounts of carbonation.    O: One of my favorite sessionable IPAs. I think I prefer this over Dogfish 90 Minute IPA for drinkability. I would rank this up there with Two Hearted Ale from Bell's. 60 Minute will stand the test of time.

Great retention with abundant but patchy lacing. Grass, caramel, rind, lemon, and soap aromas. Palate is more caramel and grass but also toast and the hops are more leathery and earthy, though still with a fairly soapy dry finish. Faint earthy to almost peppery retro-olfaction. Medium-bodied, mild carbonation but activates a little by the finish to create a fine tingle.

Alongside its grassy and piney hop-filled smell, it also has a lot of fruity aroma, most notably apple, orange, and other tropical scents. It all smells very welcoming and sweet.    Grapefruit peel and orange peel are the most prominent citrus tastes, following with very earthy flavors like pine and grass in contrast, which all encompasses its dank hoppy foundation. Feels smooth and somewhat thick, certainly not thin and watery.     This beer isn't bitter and has great hops, but compared to the 90 Minute IPA it isn't as creamy, smooth, or sweet. For a spicier IPA, this is actually quite a good shot. It's great.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 This beer pours a deep gold with a decent head. The aroma leads with caramel, the fresh barley, cannabis, pine, and burnt orange. The flavor starts with a lovely bitter pine quality, then black tea, raw grain, orange peel, green tea, and wet moss. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a very tasty beer - not as bold and fruity as modern versions, but simple and layered at the same time.

The 60 minute is milder, the 90 minute sharper. 60 minute = 6% alc. 90 minute = 9% alc. By the time you finish them both, the taste test really doesn't matter so much.

This gives a 2 finger aromatic head that lasts.  The color is a cloudy dark straw.  There is slight aroma from malt and hops.  There is a really nice balance of taste from malt and hops which is more citrusy than Sierra Nevada.  Bitterness is fully balanced throughout the palate with a hint of malt which offers a smooth finish. Very little bitter aftertaste. I love this stuff, perfectly balanced flavor!

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 1 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.5 It has a beautiful dark golden color. Nice citrus hop smell. It seems unbalanced in the flavors, while it has a good hop bite, the overly sweet malts make it seem heavy. Not for me.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Color is light gold amber. Head is a finger thick of pretty light tight foam. Lacing is medium. Nose is moderate intensity; really pretty and balanced of mango, pineapple, light fresh forest needles, yogurt, yeast spice, doughy malty richness - beautiful. Palate is also moderate minus intensity- definitely lighter than most Colorado IPAs; mirrors the palate in tropical notes, though more bitter pine resin, lots of lemon and lime notes, nice doughy sourdough, yogurt, white cake notes. Body is medium minus; again lighter then most understandable give 6%. Effervescence is light and tingly on top of tongue. Pros pretty, refreshing, balanced, complex. Cons a little light in intensity and body finish is a little vegetal. 92/100.

The smell had a nice blend of citrus to piney hops to allow a nice sweet caramel maltiness to enter in when it warms. The taste was mainly bittersweet through a wonderful combination of all of the previously mentioned flavors. On the palate, this one sits about a good light to medium in body that shows a great sessionability about it. Overall, great beer and always a spectacular beer to have with a crab meat sandwich and a slab of melted Muenster cheese over top.

The beer smells of fresh pine with a nice balance of sweet fruitiness like pineapple, mango, and subtle citrus.    The taste is as balanced as the aroma with a dry, piny start followed by sweeter tropical fruits and citrus.    Mouthfeel is medium bodied and dry. Slightly sticky aftertaste.    Overall, an all around good IPA with great balance and flavor.

The head is short and white with a creamy textured cap. Although the head is short it has good retention    Aroma: I am getting a bit of savory aromatic garlic and some biscuit.    Taste: I get a bit more of that savory herb flavor in the way of garlic and even a touch of thyme. There is a light tea-like flavor in the background. The aftertaste carries on the same flavor that the beer delivers in the beginning and middle.    Mouthfeel: It feels very clean on the palate. It is refreshing with a light bitterness and excellent carbonation. It really has an amazing presence on the palate that just livens up the overall drinking experience.    Overall: It is an enjoyable beer to drink and the more that I drink it the more familiar it becomes to my palate. It is the kind of beer that is good enough that I might pick it up every once and a while. I would recommend at least trying it out. It would pair nicely with a sandwich or a light pasta dish.

Nice lacing left behind. Aroma is citrus, with hints of herbal and floral hops, with exposed malts giving it a earthy, balanced aroma. Flavor profile is citrus peel, herbal, and floral hops with biscuit malts a little more hidden. It retains a nice balance, while delivering tasty, but simple, hop notes. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a smooth feel. Overall, a simplistic, easy to drink but flavorful, classic IPA. Not too loud, just enough oomph to make each sip a treat.

Aroma has mild piney hops alongside more assertive caramel-cracker malts. Taste is very bright and crisp, more bready malts with a mild bitter bite and piney and slightly fruity hops that come through stronger than in the aroma. Aftertaste is bitter and bready. Light-bodied. I really enjoyed this beer. Completely unfashionable in today's IPA landscape, but it is perfectly balance and delicious.

Taste: Tart and mildly bitter hops most evident that are moderate, not overwhelming (for me that is how I want hops).  Finishes dry with lasting bitterness.  Very good beer!

F - Medium body, high carbonation. Very easy to drink.  O - This was the beer that got me into IPAs in the first place. It is an excellent choice for someone just getting into hoppy beers but not quite yet a hophead. That being said, 60 minute is a beer that I think just about everyone can enjoy.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 This beer pours a clear amber color. The head is frothy, and one finger, and nice carbonation bubbles rising in the glass. The nose is somewha hoppy, but not extremely so. The taste is got a slight hop kick. Got the pine, and citrus from the hops. Not very overpowering. I get the bitter feeling all the way down and it lasts for a while. Not extremely watery feeling. It's ok, but the 90 and 120 are better, but a decent IPA.

It lacks sweet notes, but has a bitter, evolving hoppy flavor from the start to the end of the sip. At the end, I do detect the citrus notes-- it's more grapefruit than lemon. I would buy this beer again if I wanted something not-sweet and not-sour. It's quite neutral.

Feel: Medium-heavy, slightly slick beer, medium energy on the amount of carbonation  Overall: Not too bad, an IPA that I don't have any problems drinking.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Preamble: Dogfish is a damn good brewery, and I am by and large an enormous fan. 60 Minute - at least as of late - however, has fallen flat.    Don't get me wrong, everything about this beer's backstory, composition, brew process, and even label description leads one to believe that it should be some straight divine nectar, and considering the undeniable hop presence, this should be the beer I dream about. But... Disclaimer over.    The hoppiness at first taste is pleasant, yes, and I love the bitter grassiness, but it gives way to nothing else. If the selling point of your hop behemoth IPA is the lupulin monstrosity therein, I'm hoping for a little more complexity than just grass.    Again, I sandwich the criticism with an absolute adoration for Dogfish, an understanding that perhaps I may not yet have the palate to appreciate the nuances, and a recognition that I have appreciated this beer more so in the past.    There is also a pretty solid malt backbone intermingling with the hoppy lead.    Have I been apologetic enough?

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 This one has been near the top of my hit list for a while: Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA… or was it the 75 Minute IPA? Or the 90 Minute IPA? Or their 120 Minute IPA? Case in point: Dogfish Head make a lot of IPAs and it’s hard to keep track of them, but I’ll give them all a go when I get the chance. As an East Coast style IPA I’m expecting it to be smooth bodied with a juicy hop aspect and a decent balance between bitter/sweet (perhaps erring on the side of sweet). Fun fact: Dogfish sharks have venom which coats their dorsal spines which is mildly toxic to humans - true story.    Poured from a 355ml bottle into a nonic pint.    A: Cloudy marigold body with a nice dense one centimetre cream-coloured head. This looks absolutely fantastic for an IPA - just the right shade of amber, cloudy and with top-notch head retention, nice! 8/10.    S: Once again hop-fade is the bane of my existence - although this was bottle in 09/16 (4 months ago)… I guess that’s long enough to expect hop-fade. Aroma is more malt than hop driven, damn shame, notes of: Caramel, fresh baked biscuits, hint of citrus, and a light floral touch. Still not bad but definitely lacking hop aroma in the 4 months since it was brewed. 7/10.    T: Still firmly citrus driven in the flavour though, begins with lemon, then grapefruit through to fresh-squeezed orange in the finish, which is of a medium (and quite appropriate) bitterness. Caramel/biscuit malts throughout the palate lay a solid sweet foundation for this (after 4 months still) hop driven delight. 9/10.    M: Medium bodied with a nice dense but light carbonation, pretty spot on mouthfeel. 9/10.    D: The closest IPA I would compare this to is Smuttynose Finestkind IPA, however Smuttynose edges this overall. It must be noted that Smuttynose was about the same age when I tried it so really between the two IPAs it’s really about the one that aged best, I would love to have gotten my hands on both when they were fresh however East Coast US beers don’t seem to get shipped as easily and frequently as West Coast brews, hence the possible discrepancy between my scores - really with IPAs I am fast learning (from homebrew as well as drinking): The fresher the better, and: Old IPAs - don’t bother. 8/10.    Food match: The classic IPA match of Thai, or even Laotian larb would be ace.

I live in California, so I usually stick to west coast beers. This is surprisingly the first Dog Fish Head beer I've sampled, despite knowing quite a bit about the brewery and the uniqueness of the styles of beers Sam Calamine and his brew wizards do at DFH.     Pours a nice golden color with evenly spread foam around the upper rim of the glass with carbonation bubbles zipping up spontaneously from the bottom of the glass. Lacing present.     On the nose- ah yes, citrus--but not overwhelming and splashes of herb pale malts coming through.    Tastes of citrus (lemon, grapefruit, zest, with pine (not resiny) and malt sweet. VERY well balanced. Usually you think, big IPA (relatively low A.B.V) would expect a big punch in the mouth...but not at all. The even distribution of hop flavors in my mouth leave me quite giddy and my pallet fresh. The mouth feel is light, carbonated, almost creamy with a bit of crispness on the end, not leaving your mouth sticky.     Overall- Truly a quintessential session IPA. I'd bid this beer over many other styles. I think this beer is a great bridge for those looking to get into drinking more IPA's, or those that are looking for a well balanced (not overly hopped) brew with a well balanced flavor, great mouthfeel, and lower alcohol content--to leave you drinking more and not feeling "hopped out". Well done.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This prototypical east coast IPA pours a tangerine color with a medium foamy white head and a somewhat high amount of carbonation. The smell is piney and somewhat citrusy. It is a very fresh scent. The taste is of pine, bold orange, lemon, and some slightly sweet, bready malts. The finish is pretty clean, with very little lingering hop bitterness. The body is medium, but maybe very slightly lighter than the average IPA. This is a very light, refreshing IPA, which has become too rare in my opinion these days without going into session IPA territory. Likewise, the balance is also fantastic, another IPA rarity as of late. This is an eminently drinkable IPA that is accessible even to those that aren’t major fans of the style. My only criticism would be its lack of complexity, but you don’t need to be too complex if your flavors are this on point. It is a classic.

Citrus, primarily oranges with a touch of grapefruit, quite a bit of pale malts, and a hint of pine.     Lots of pale malts out front, coming behind it are hits of orange pith, grapefruit, and a touch of juicy hop. Pine sharpness at the end that's not tasted as much as its felt.     Feel is crisp with some creaminess and stickiness. I could use a little more of a lighter feel and more carbonation, but the present characteristics keep it from feeling watery.     Overall, 60 Minute is the quintessential session IPA. I don't think very many beers come close to this. 60 minute is an easy, flavorful, balanced session IPA. In a dictionary, 60 minute should be pictured.

What an enjoyable blend of hop flavors done just right!    The mouthfeel is medium with mild carbonation.    I'll rate 60 Minute IPA | Dogfish Head Craft Brewery with an overall 4.5. I'd rate higher if the hops had a bit more bitterness about them. I gotta say once again the blend of desirable hop tastes really are what hooked me in with this one. Thanks to @nicholas2121 for lending a few bottles he'd grabbed while in his travels to Chicago.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 60 Minute IPA brewed by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, with an ABV of 6.00% This brew pours out a nice golden amber color with a nice white head. The smell of 60 Minute IPA, is rich with hops, grains and malts. There is also some grassy notes in the smell of this IPA. This IPA has the look and smell of most IPA's on the market. Now for the taste, it is bold with hop flavors. Then you pick up on the grains and malts. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a nice balance to it. There is a fair amount of lacing to 60 Minute IPA , it sticks to the glass well. 60 Minute IPA has a lot going on in it, however it is like most IPA's on the market. Not saying that is a bad thing. I like how smooth this brew goes down. It is really hard to pick up on the 6.00% ABV in this brew. The mouth feel of 60 Minute IPA is rich , bold, Clean, and refreshing. Overall I'm giving 60 Minute IPA a 4.50 out of 5. I would buy this brew again. This is a smooth drinking IPA. If you are looking for a smooth IPA look this brew up. Dogfish Head Craft Brewery did a real nice job with this brew.

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 This IPA is absolutely amazing. It is definitely a beer to recommend to someone who wants to get in to IPA's.   Look: Pours a light amber color with a healthy head.  Smell: Smells of a variety of hops from east to west coast and maybe some spicy European hops. All of the hops is making it so that only a faint crystal caramel malt can come through.   Taste: Hops, Hops, Malts, Malts and more hops. Very well balanced. Got the citrusyness from the hops, the spiciness, the herbalness, and the very pleasant sweetness of the malts that goes away without a trace at the end.  Feel: Decent carbonation. Seems a bit lighter in carbonation than your typical IPA's. Not too thin, very very good in the mouth  Overall: This beer is a great IPA. It is a great representation of what I think an IPA should be. It is very well balanced and very refreshing. It is not a death by hop bomb, and the hops isn't exclusively tropical citrus, pineapple and mango. It's got some citrus, some pine, some floral notes, and a little bit of an herbal spiciness. And the alcohol content isn't through the roof. Definitely a good choice to go with a dinner and not have the night be over. Highly recommended if you're trying to get in to the IPA's.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 As much as I love the 90 minute and so many other beers they make, how is that their flagship IPA is only above average? Don't get me wrong, I turn to the 60-minute a lot, too much quite frankly. Always solid, if always solid is good enough.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 One-and-a-half fingers of a cream-colored head rests on top of a hazy, amber liquid. Lighter highlights mark the bottom. Good head retention. Good lacing.    First to the nose is a pungent, herbal hop quality and some light citrus. A grainy malt aroma comes to suggest popcorn and crackers. Dried herbs and slight spices punctuate the aroma, and these notes increase as the beer warms.     Strong crackery malt mixes with herbal and spicy hops for a very mellow, rounded tasting IPA. There is no hop smash, or intense aromatics. Taste is deep, rustic, and smooth. Popcorn-like quality of the malt, as well as a slight orange citrus quality from the hops are increasing, all riding on that mellow backbone of dried herbs. Graham-cracker like flavors become more apparent. So too does a slight buttery-ness. Bitterness is medium and mostly rides on the finish, which leans to the herbs and produces a slight metallic twinge to the aftertaste.    Medium body with a slight creaminess. Finish is "gulpy"- that is, not too carbonated or attenuated. Mixes interestingly with the herbal, somewhat metallic aftertaste.     A much less intense IPA than I remembered, even compared to the other "old standards." The beer is still a great example of an endlessly drinkable India Pale from the East Coast.

But when I have access to Alchemist, Lawsons, Tree House etc....this does take a back seat. Solid, solid IPA.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Pours a clear honey gold color with a generous white frothy head that takes it's time dissipating to a thin head that leaves lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is mildly citrus with equally mild hops. The flavor follows the nose pleasantly with a little bitterness in the end. The feel is nice and crisp. Overall a nice beer, but not special.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 A: [3.75] Beer is a golden yellow color. It has a scant 1/4 finger of head that moves down to a thin wispy layer on the surface of the beer. The bottle lists the ABV (6.0%) and there is a bottled on date (05/17/2016).    S: [3.50] Crackers, then slight caramel and grassy scents. Overall the aroma is pretty subdued.    T: [3.75] Toffee, caramel up front then it rolls into some piney hop flavor. Maybe some hints of lemon rind late.    M: [4.25] This beer is smooth. There is no jarring hop whollop late. It has a nice heft to it and a nice level of carbonation.    O: [3.75] For an IPA this is pretty low key on the hops and bitter. I get very little hop aroma at all. The hops are more noticeable in the flavor - but even there it is mellow. This is really easy drinking with a really excellent smooth mouthfeel. Even at 6.0% you could put away a few of these pretty quickly.

I enjoyed the fact that the hops didn't overwhelm the malt. It doesn't have a real strong citrus taste, but a decent balance between citrus and pine flavors. This is a good, reliable IPA, although not a standout for me.

Big head, roughly 3 fingers deep. Excellent head retention, tons of lacing.     Smell: Citrus: Grapefruit and sweet orange peel. Pine. Touch of cracker from the malts. Overall clean aroma, nothing seemed out of proportion.    Taste: Citric hops up front: grapefruit, lemon zest, and a splash of orange. Sweet, light notes of caramel sat between the hops and malts. In my humble opinion, this is a perfect malt profile for an IPA. Light, cracker/bread.     Feel: Light bodied. Moderate/high carbonation. Dry finish.    Overall: The quintessential IPA.

Medium feel and carbonation. I could drink a whole six pack of these with absolutely no problem.    Just an all around world class IPA. I love this beer. Dogfish Head set out to brew a full flavored, refreshing and uncompromisingly hoppy IPA and they did just that.

I took this beer for granted, like an old dog who is always home, at the front door, waiting for you.     Drunk from a refrigerated bottle in beautiful Savannah GA.     One can find hopper, fruitier, "copperer"and other comparative "er's" out there but with comparitives, there must be the item to which they are compared. Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA is it. The aroma is hoppy without pine tree nutso stuff, the head is thick and frothy even from the bottle, the appearance is "delightfully clear,"the color is yellow to copper without haze, and the flavor is classic, nervously balanced bitterness. This is the precision beer. If this were a wine it would be a racy, but balanced between acidity and sweet Mosel Reisling. But it's not. I am glad it is a beer. Go Delaware! Go Dogfish!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Amber to orange fade, minimal head  Smells of carmelly malt sweetness, orange, apricot, peach, mango, some pine in there  Surprisingly grainy tasting up front. Sweetness is more floral than citrusy here. Very hoppy, of course  Feels slightly more dry than I prefer, not a real problem though  A good beer as expected though admittedly it was brewed 9 weeks ago

Smell: Smells of crisp citrus hops with a little malt in the background. Some pine in there too.   Taste: Tasted amazing. Had the citrus hops up front with some grapefruit and ended with earthy pine notes and the malt background.  Feel: Medium body feels light on the tongue with moderate carbonation.   Overall: Great hoppy IPA with lots of flavor and good mouth feel. Would definitely buy it again.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Beer is amber with bubbles streaming towards the surface, forming a tall white head that slowly subsides and leaves behind solid lacing.    Smell is straight-up hops, very citrusy. Taste follows nose. There is a lingering citrusy bitterness,like how an orange rind tastes. Carbonation is fairly average.    I'm not an IPA fan, but this is remarkably drinkable - though it yearns to be paired with powerful savoury or spicy foods.

Taste is pine and resin upfront with hints of citrus and baked bread from the malt, with the lightest sweetness at the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and quite carbonated, with a drying quality from the hop bitterness. Overall, a very good lower abv ipa that pairs well with a cheeseburger.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Re-rating this. Pours copper with an off-white head. Tiny bit of lacing. Aroma is citrus/pine/yeasty/biscuity malts. Taste is a bitter citrus with bready malts. I taste some floral-ish hops and a slight caramel malt presence. Feel is medium with medium carbonation. Overall, I'm not a huge fan of east-coast IPA's. They seem more suited for cooler weather drinking. Dogfish Head balances this one well though, so I'm not complaining. Really can't go wrong with a sixer of these.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 The third most rated beer in BA's most populated style, 60 Minute certainly qualifies as a cash cow that pays for Dogfish Head's many experiments and revivals of fallen styles.    While I'm not a fan of how NE IPA's typically Look, their Smells often make up for Looks. So is the case with 60 Minutes, a trendsetter. The fruity hops really dominate the nose with almost a belated recognition that there is a semi-sweet malt in there. For Tastes, the malt develops more and provides balance until about the fourth sip when the hops (60 IBU) remind me this beer is above my bitterness threshold. Too bitter a finish to eat with food.    I understand this brew's popularity, just not something I'd return to for a third time unless I was really thirsty and needing refreshment.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Bottle dated 2/23/2016. DFH Tulip (the first DFH beer I have actually had in this!)    Appearance: pours a slightly hazy gold, with one finger bright white head and initially very active carbonation that fades to a few large slow bubbles. Not much in the way of retention, just a few bubbles at the edge and a thin skim across the top. Moderate lacing.    Smell: hoppy and sweet. Mostly a sweet mandarin orange, with a little pineapple. Pretty traditional and very inviting.     Taste: dry and piney arrival. Broadens to show off a little citrus and resin before turning to a light, bone dry soda cracker, with a moderate bitterness that lingers, but only mildly. Very cleansing.     Mouthfeel: on the lighter side of midweight. Well carbonated, but not excessive. Clean and crisp as can be.    Overall: this is a very refreshing, balanced but extremely dry, crisp, and piney IPA. I could see myself really jonesing for this on occasion, but it's not one I would make a regular. Very much in the vein of Finestkind and Stone IPA. A good "food IPA" perhaps.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 Behold, long rumored, but often unverifiable, the rumored, 'normal' beer from DFH! Hardly any gimmickry. Looks a mild amber colored pale with 1/2" white head. Aroma was super mild hop grapefruit kick downs.    Taste was a mildly toasted pale with some toffee aspect to the malt impingement. Still has some sweetness that is above average for style. Bitter notes get in there from the '60 minute' hop boil, these are mostly bittering hops. Its a decent beer, pretty average for style, nothing "outstanding" about it. Really does seem quaint and balanced these days.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Not as overwhelming hoppy as the name led me to believe. Still a very hoppy American IPA. Light in color with a white head. As you would expect, both the nose and the taste are dominated by the beautiful flower scent of the hops in the style of the best west coast IPAs. Too strong for me to drink all night, but also less hoppy than many American IPAs, I will definitely have another when I get a chance.

T: Lots of floral hops, some spicy malts, a nice medium bitterness balanced out by sweet toasted malts. Very drinkable.    L: Light body, with creamy carbonation, very easy drinking.

Doesn't really fill the senses like  it's big brother DFA 90 minute: (Almost a DFH 90 minute "lite" if  that makes sense.) This was an older bottle, that was arguably beyond its  best by date + storage conditions may have been somewhat suspect. May revisit  this beer / review with another bottle at some point in the future.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Appearance: Pours a golden copper color.    Overall: The aroma has a great floral hop goodness. This beer was incredibly hoppy yet it isn’t overpowering. You get a hop bite with noticeable bitterness, but in the best possible way. It is incredibly balanced and there is definite malty backbone that is very pleasant. The drinkablity is great and it is incredibly smooth. Perfect IPA!   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Smell: citrus, caramel, pineapple, bitter piney hops. Taste: bready malt, dank citrus, med carbonation.

It's very well balanced. While there are no overly fruity or piney flavors that jump out at you, the balanced, hoppy, crisp flavor and feel of this beer make for a strangely delightful taste. Very drinkable and delicious.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 Poured 12oz bottle into snifter and it was bottled about 3 months ago. Color is deep orange gold with 2 finger white head. Nice retention with webbed lacing on my glass. The aroma is quite floral and citrusy with hints of light caramel malts in the background. Flavor follows the nose well with a mighty hop bite that is leveled from the sweeter malts. Perfect carbonation with a sticky medium fell and dry finish. Overall a true classic IPA that uses the massive hops well.
