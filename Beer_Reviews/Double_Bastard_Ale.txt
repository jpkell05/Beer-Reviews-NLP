look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A: The beer is coppery amber in color. Light tan carbonation that retains around the rim with no lacing.  S: Strong barley malt aroma is awesome. Sweet caramel and alcohol notes with a touch of hops.   T: tastes like a malt bomb explosion of high alcohol sweetness. Caramel and brown sugar up front. Then the self-proclaimed unreasonable amount of hops pokes through. Noticeable alcohol warming and vodka-like aftertaste. Moderate bitterness and hops balance out the sweetness making this a well-balanced, if unusual concoction.   M: Body is fairly light and syrupy, like a day old coke.   O: I think this beer is awesome. That being said, I like aggressive, in your face flavors. Your mom will hate this beer. But isn’t that a reason to try it?

Big, tight bubbled head above a dark amber body. Sticky lace already apparant. Dark druit, briny hops, and big chocolate malts in the nose.     Huge aggressive pine loaded with medicinal note takes the lead, but the balance here is supurb. Hard to believe this is eleven percent. Strong flavor, but little alcohol leakage. Not for everyday drinking, but when you want something both diabolical and well crafted...

Strong aroma of plums and caramel, slight pine.  Wonderful cherry, tea, toffee, leather, with hoppy dank and pine in combination.  Smooth, full mouthfeel. Alcohol is noticeable, even after two years, but not hot or dominating.  Equally appropriate for a bleak midwinter’s eve alone, or a jolly gathering of friends. Looking forward to its return.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours a deep, dark amber coloration with a large, creamy head. Smells of caramel malt, toffee, red berries citrus and pine. Taste follows the nose, with a caramel, biscuity malt backbone and some toffee, chocolate and red berries, complemented by hoppy notes of citrus and pine. This really is an Imperial Arrogant Bastard, which really piles on the malt, without losing much of the hops. Depth of flavor seems more intense compared to normal AB, especially when it comes to the malt presence and fruitiness. Hop profile seems a little more mellow, although there still is considerate piney bitterness (this may be due to the 26 months old bottle). The higher ABV is noticeable as a slight, warming presence, but there really is no unpleasant boozyness to this at all. What really needs to be highlighted compared to normal AB is the thick, smooth mouthfeel, which is absolutely sublime.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 2013 bottle.    Appearance is amber red, with a fairly minimal head. There's a big nose, a combination of sweet caramel and hops. The taste is complex, but hops and bitterness dominate the taste. It's just slightly sweet in the taste, enough to make it interesting, but not enough to compete with the bitterness. The ABV is not particularly noticeable, but that might be because the hops are strong enough that who has time to notice the ABV?    This beer is about midway between a classic hoppy barleywine and a conventional strong ale. What I mean is that a strong ale is something you can drink, while a barleywine is usually just a sipper. This one is tempting to drink, not just to sip a bit, but then all that bitterness makes me hold back.    I wind up respecting this beer, but it's not really in my wheelhouse.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 From a 650ml bottle served at 14 degrees Celsius into a snifter. Bottled on 15.10.2016 – aged for 9+ months in the bottle.    Look: The beer pours a clear light brown with red highlights topped by 4cm of dense, creamy, tan head which dissipates into a craggy cap in 3+ minutes. Such impressive head for the hefty 11% ABV. Fine-looking beer indeed.    Smell: Complex! Strong and well-balanced - very enticing. Citrusy, resiny, herbal, and floral hops (grapefruit, pine & jasmin). Malty caramel, brown bread, and milk chocolate. Faint dark fruit esters and alcohol. Goodness me!    Taste: Strong and bitter – a punch in your mouth, just the way I like it. Rich, complex and follows the aroma seamlessly. Notes of caramel, dark fruit (raisins), resinous pine, and citrus (grapefruit). The finish is long, strong, and bitter with a touch of minerality.    Feel: Full body with medium-low carbonation. Heavy, borderline chewy with considerable – yet not hot – alcohol warmth. Slightly astringent which likely stems from the extreme bitterness.    Overall: Big, bold, and aggressive – I absolutely love it. I had the whole bomber to myself and I feel like I could do another one just because it's that delicious. A wonderful brew displaying excellent craftsmanship. Beer doesn't get much better than this for me.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Bottled on 10/14/15. Served from 22oz bottle into glass at home. Pours deep amber red in color, medium high clarity, with a tan colored head. The head quickly diminishes to a a thin ring of bubbles on the glass. Legs visible when agitated. Assertive aroma, sweet caramel malt and lots of alcohol, resulting in a preserved fruit character. Some fruitiness that may be alcoholic esters or hops. Flavor is more malt with lots of alcohol and high hoppy bitterness. The body is full, almost chewy, medium low carbonation with a decidedly dry finish. Even with all the alcohol aroma and flavor there is little "heat" detectable at the finish. Overall this beer lacks the hop character expected, but that is most likely due to the age of the bottle. It comes off as an aggressively bitter American barleywine and really is an amped-up version of the original.

Spotted lacing down the glass with a hazy color lighter than the beer.     Smell- Definitely get the alcohol smell but there are sweet smells of candy or sugar in there. A malty smell seemed to dominate the aroma.     Taste- The sweetness really gets pushed out by the alcohol. There seems to be some caramel or molasses mixed that I didn't get from the smell. I neat bitter finish and some citrus thrown in.     Feel- A thick mix with enough carbonation to make it. A dry finish, maybe the high ABV.     Overall- Very drinkable for 11%. Stays true to the style and the light candy sweetness mixes well. A great beer for a cool day

Hazy deep ruddy brown in color with lots of sediment floating around, the pour forms up thick creamy light tan head that withstands with good retention before slowly sinking to a lasting bubble sheet on the surface and leaving lots of lacing patch and spot.    Rich and intense malt in the aroma with the array of sweet candy, caramel, burnt sugar, dough, butter bread, toasted biscuit, and charred nut while hop provides its citrus, pine, tropical, and slight spicy in subtle fashion together with a hint of alcohol perfume and cherry.    Super malty and cherry boozy in the taste, it kicks off with the vast malty goodness of sweet candy, caramel, burnt sugar, dough, butter bread, toasted biscuit, and charred nut. Hop is being nicely complement with slight citrus and pine as well as a very extreme bitterness while alcohol wraps all the things up with its sweet, spicy, and warming touch.    Full of chewy malt and rather syrupy body with smooth mouthfeel and medium carbonation that is well enough to carry all the things well, finish is very dry.    Complex and more arrogant than its little brother, the aging helps to develop some more on malt while being a bit drop on crisp hop character. Still a truly great brew in anyway.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 This is the 2013 release, which I've been sitting on for a while. A 22oz bottle with a bottling date of Aug 2013. ABV is stated as 11.2%. Acquired from the Brewdog webshop ages ago and carefully stored.    A: Poured into a tulip. Bottle conditioned. A deep ruby-red hue with light carbonation and some floating sediment. Yields a decent head of creamy off-white foam that lasts for a minute or two before collapsing to a patchy surface layer.    S: Aroma of sweet caramel malt and pungent hops, with notes of toffee, barley sugar, grain, pine resin, spicy hops, sherry, oxidation and booze. Complex, but definitely gives off an impression of being past its best.    T: Tastes of sweet malt and exceptionally bitter hops. Hints of caramel, sugar, grain, leafy bitterness, pine resin, spice, mild sherry and a warming touch of alcohol in the rear. Quite oxidised, and lacks much of the aromatic hop character that might be expected. A forceful flavourfest nonetheless.    M: Mouthfeel is smooth and thick, with hop oils and booze tingling the palate. Carbonation lightly tickles the tongue. A big, chewy texture followed by an aftertaste of sweet malt, stinging hop bitterness and oxidation.    O: An impressive brew, but I suspect I held on to this for a bit too long. Looks nice, while the aroma and flavour are huge blends of sweet malt, pine resin and leafy bitterness. Quite a bit of oxidation present, as well as the loss of aromatic hop notes that would have provided more balance to the malt. Good body. Interesting, but probably best sampled younger!   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Had two bottles of this. Both are gone now. Review from notes. Purchased from the LCBO for $10.95 CDN per 22oz bottle.    Appearance - A bright red color, a finger of light tan head and some lacing. Also a not inconsequential amount of haze.    Smell - Big and boozy with plenty of molasses and inviting. Burnt sugar in there too. A malt bomb that doesn't shy away from hops either.    Taste - boozy and very bitter, some elements of smoke within, peat flavors and boozy finish.    Mouthfeel - Smooth and thick, chewy with good carbonation and a very dry finish.    Overall - A fine big beer that left me a little disappointed. Certainly drinks like an 11 percenter. Wouldn't turn it down, but won't go out of my way to purchase a third bottle.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Poured into a chalice: color is amber, a little hazy, tan head with an amber tint, bubbles are fine to small, presenting 1/2 inch thick and lingering with a solid top, head laces the glass sides.     Smell is sharp, might be the booziness, the smoothness and caramel flavors are hidden at first, then come through lighter than expected with moderate hoppiness.    Taste is huge malt, heavy caramel and lighter molasses, sharp alcohol, big bitterness. Definitely a doubly arrogant beer, but also one I think needs at least a few months aging to soften the bitter, boozy blow.     Mouthfeel is less sharp as it warms, moderate carbonation, smoothness starts to exude itself but the bitterness overtakes and bits the tongue.    I tend to like big, malty, hoppy, smooth brews but the double bastard seems a bit young yet for the 2016 release.

L: Hazy Garnet, incredible retention of the finger width tan head.     S: Pineapple, Caramel, Alcohol very present, Pine Hops and lots of malt.     T: Incredibly smooth flavors present themselves beginning with the hops, slight citrus and pine, morphing into the malty backbone of toffees and caramels, then finishing with the bite of the very present alcohol even after over a year of bottle aging.     F: Medium-Full bodied, super-smooth on the palate.     O: What an excellent beer!    UPDATE: 2009 release! 8 year old bottle! 22oz poured into Snifter. No exact date just 2009.     L: Murky russet brown. No head whatsoever but it bubbles a little.     S: Surprisingly I still get a decent amount of alcohol, but mostly this is some rich caramel malts like, citric and pine hop notes, some honey like sweetness as well.     T: Lots of malt again, caramel and toffee, with almost a toast flavor, alcohol is still present. Citrus and pine hops are gone from the flavor.     F: Full body, carbonation is less than average, dry finish.     O: Honestly not as good as a fresher one but still neat to try.

I don't know about you guys but Double Bastard is widely available here in New England pretty much anywhere you go. Even the street corner liquor stores carry it and it's pretty much guaranteed to be on tap at most bars. It's cheap and it truly does live up to its reputation. Silky smooth mouth feel when strong notes throughout the taste profile. This is a damn good ale that you simply can not go wrong with. Is it the best in the world? Probably not, but it's a sure fire go to in times of need.

Three fingers of foamy white head last awhile... great lacing.    S: Rich caramel malts... hops... aggression and arrogance.    T/F: Rich, malty, and assertive... caramel and dark sugars followed by some big time hop bitterness that is pretty much a kick in the jaw. Full bodied and thick. Well carbonated. Warming with the EtOH, but dangerously drinkable. Becomes more rich and full with a few fruity overtones as it comes up to room temp. Finish is sticky and bittersweet.    O: I love Arrogant Bastard... and I really love Double Bastard. Just outstanding beer, and always a treat.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 22oz bottle poured into a globe. 2014 vintage is exactly two years old at this point.    A: Deep red-brown color with orangey hues. Fairly hazy. Cream -colored head settles shortly. Specks of lacing.    S: Loads of toasty bread crust. Chewy caramel. Deeply toasted biscuits. Scones. Big raisin and date fruit character. Hops still retain a fair amount of earthy and spicy pull, though they've subsided a bit.    T: Chewy caramel leads. Subtle hints of toffee. Aggressive toasty character. Heavily toasted crust. Scorched pizza crust. Raisin, fig, and date fruit. Hops are still pretty aggro, retaining a lot of bitterness and spicy, oily, and earthy flavor. Alcohols pick it up and spike hard toward the back end. Almost vodka-like. Oily hop finish leaves a strong trailing bitterness.    M: Big, thick, and weighty. Round and chewy in texture with a mild coating feel. Abrasive hop astringency dries things out. Medium-low carbonation.    O: This strong ale is very American Barleywine-esque, and quite aggressive. Huge, overly toasty, bitter, and boozy. Untamed and unashamed. It takes the palate a good while to get used to the beating this beer dishes out, and even then it's still a slow sipper. It's a weird sort of beer in that it's kind of too much and a part of me thinks I shouldn't like it, but yet I somehow still do enjoy it.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Smells of pungent resin and bitters, with plenty of caramel and white chocolate to balance. The head is a lovely tiramisu ice cream color, and is smooth and long -lasting, leaving spotty lace. The body is a very deep copper, and while the clarity is murky, it's more romantically mysterious than it is off-putting. The bitterness is strong, thanks to heaps of resinous and floral hops, but is made quite palatable by equally massive toffee and sugared hazelnut flavors. Oaky booze plays a big role as well, but is made more sophisticated by a complex garnish of spices that run the gamut from white pepper to cloves. Medium-bodied and delectably creamy, the mouthfeel is quite seductive, with a nice kick of carbonation to boot. Lots of alcohol warming, and a residual stickiness which leads to uncontrollable lip smacking. It's a big-bodied brew for the fearless, and yet, it's stylistically sound. For those of us who are both hop heads and big beer lovers, Double Bastard does not disappoint.

Aroma was lots of alcohol, unsweetened caramel and toffee malt smells, lots of chinook hop notes.    Taste is like a hefty barleywine, still tons of malt, that caramel, toffee and brown malt tones keep coming, but wave after wave of Chinook and Cascade hop drops all over it. This is one hearty sumbitch.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 It’s a dark brown ale with a thick, sticky white lacing. It has good caramel malt character, but the hops are really what take over with strong flavors of grapefruit and pine. It has a bitter quality that could almost make you think that this could be a double or triple IPA, though it’s officially a strong ale. You can definitely taste the alcohol in this whopping 11.4% beer, but it’s not overwhelming. It’s a really good strong ale. I’ve tried most of Stone’s beers and at this point I would say that while this is better than average even at this great brewery, there are definitely some Stone beers that I like more (Arrogant Bastard, Imperial Stout, Ruination, etc.).

S: Toasty malt, caramel toffee sweetness, kinda floral, dark fruit, and a noticeable alcohol note.    T: Dark fruit, berry, toasty bready malt, caramel toffee sweetness, spicy earthy kinda herbal hops, faint citrus, and a hint of chocolatey roasty malt on the back end.

A: The body is cristalline copper with a beige head that has a minimal but beautiful retention and lots of lacing.  S: The aroma is resinous and just a little bit of citrus but all of this in the smallest amount possível, very very soft.  T: The taste is just like the aroma, being very soft, more resinous-y and just a touch of citrus in the end.  M: The body is medium to low with a bit of harsh carbonation but the feeling JN the back of the mouth is gorgeous.  O: Quite a good experience drinking this at BeerTemple. Quite a good beer from one of my favorito breweries.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Served in a snifter, it pours a clear copper with ruby glare, with a one-finger head that dissipated quickly.     The bouquet is quite interesting. Caramel, butterscotch, creamy vanilla, boozy as in a spirit, cherry, malty sweetness, just a tad citric as in orange and earthy/spicy hoppiness.   This is already an old bottle for Stone standards, hence the hoppiness is rather subdued.     Upfront you get a lot of carbonation to tease your palate. Bittersweet thrust of flavors, although at the end, the sweetness prevails.   Notes of caramel, molasses, citrusy fruit, butterscotch, spirit booziness, cherry, raisins and a slight hint of apricot.   The aftertaste is long, with a decaying caramel and molasses sweetness and a growing bitterness. Double bastard coats your palate with bitterness. Very assertive, almost aggressive flavors.   Medium body, smooth.     This is quite a special beer.

Maybe it's just me but this beer seemed to have almost no aroma at all. The head collapsed quickly but left some very attractive lacing behind. The best thing about this beer is the flavor. It is big and bold, just the way I like 'em. This one is almost like a highly hopped domestic quadrupel. This was my first positive experience with Stone products.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Bomber bottled on 10/8/15. Stored at 55F since purchased last November. Poured into a 10 oz snifter at about 55 degrees F. Pours a clear dark ruby red with some minuscule particulate floating around inside, so it's not completely filtered; this has a positive effect on the flavor of the beer. The off-white head is about a finger and a half, and dissipates within a couple of minutes to patchy splotches and a ring around the edge of the glass. The smell is caramel, vanilla, dark ripe fruit like plum or raisins, a hint of citrus in the background. The taste right off the bat is caramel, a hint of plum, slightly diminished hoppy bitterness that balances very nicely with the malt profile. Really feels like hoppy barely wine. Perfect amount of bitterness and ripe orange and raisin sweetness lingers on the palate for a long time, which is very pleasing and makes me want to drink it very slow, even though it easily goes down silky and smooth. It feels medium bodied with light to moderate carbonation. Alcohol presence (11%) is barely even noticeable, in fact, the Arrogant bastard (7.2%ABV) at this temperature exhibits more alcohol presence. This beer is a great pleasure to drink, and I suspect would age very nicely.

The body is smooth and surprisingly light and easy drinking given the massive flavor and ABV.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Bomber picked up at the LCBO a few months ago; the last of four bottles from their Bastard Box. Bottled Sept 9 2015 and served slightly chilled.    Pours a clear ruby-red amber colour with visible flecks of stuff hovering throughout. One finger of creamy, off-white foam is seated at the surface, fading gradually over the next few minutes until only a wide, frothy collar and some bubbly film remains. I am getting notes of caramel, butterscotch, plum and candied orange on the nose, as well as hints of maraschino cherry, grapefruit, pine resin and some rummy, boozy sweetness.    Not bad, but the hop flavours seem to have faded a bit over the last ~5+ months, making this more of a malt-forward experience than anything else. Brown sugar and butterscotch, some nuttiness and a few hints of raisin and fig comprise the front end, with hops rounding out the back. They impart flavours of citrus and earthiness, with relentless resiny bitterness leading up to the bittersweet finish. Boozy aftertaste that blends hints of dark fruit, caramelized sugar and hoppy bitterness. Full-bodied, with light carbonation levels and a smooth, fairly soft mouthfeel. A good strong ale, though perhaps a little overrated.     Final Grade: 4.02, a very respectable A-. Double Bastard talks a big game (in an unnecessarily verbose manner) on the back label, but in all honesty it's probably my least-favourite of the Bastard Box beers. To be fair, this bottle is nearly 6 months old, and strong ales have never really been my thing, so my tempered reception may have more to do with personal biases and uncontrollable variables more than anything else. It's well-made, but I would much rather drink regular Arrogant Bastard - this one is just too sweet and boozy to land in my wheelhouse. As usual, different strokes apply for different folks, and while this ale might not be my thing, it is still definitely worth a try.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Started garage cold, about 45* and nothing special. Put glass down and picked up again 50 minutes later. Totally over the top re taste (smooth) and alcohol present but pleasurable. Will store some for aging.    update: just opened a 2015, and it is absolutely amazing. Poured it into a frozen mug as the beer itself wasn't all that cold. Once they reach their total ambient temperature tasted it and it is out of this world.    new update: my local beer distributor brought out a case of 2013 Double Bastard. I immediately bought it as it was already aged by three years. Not only that but the price was 2013 variety. A win-win. The Taste was exceptionally mild, the alcohol not overwhelming. Overall a very very mild-mannered totally amp'd up beer.    So now I have one Case of the 2013 and a case of the 2015. Both are amazing.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2011 vintage    L: Pours a mildly turbid, very dark ruby-amber with tinges of burnt orange at the edges and a moderately-sized off-white head.    S: Grassy, piney hops and some toffee and caramelized wort mingle together. Turbinado sugar, dried dark fruit and dark rum.    T: More grassy resinous hops upfront, with concentrated toasty boozy malt behind it. Semi-sweet finish with lots of grassy piney hops. Though bold, everything here comes across as quite balanced and very drinkable for the style and strength – no real oxidized notes, just a really nice mellowing of the flavors.    F: Medium-full body with a chewy, resinous mouthfeel. Just under medium carbonation and a decent but far from overwhelming amount of heat in the finish.     Thoughts: This beer aged beautifully, and actually come out pretty similar to the Old Guardian I laid down at roughly the same time. Highly recommended.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Arrogant Bastard Brewing Co. - Double Bastard Ale. 11% ABV. 22oz bomber split between two snifters. Bottled 10/14/14.    Look: Settles in the glass a deep, hazy caramel mahogany. Almost no presence of head, only a thin ring of white bubbles along the rim.    Smell: Strong bourbon, hops, and malts, followed by some char, oak, toffee, caramel, and brown sugar.    Feel: Full bodied, heavy and chewy. Has a little bit of carbonation to balance.    Taste: Bourbon, char, hops, malt, and alcohol are immediate, and leave a lasting impression the whole way through. Caramel, brown sugar, and toffee appear near the backend to give it some sweetness.    Overall: What a bastard indeed; this is a huge, unforgiving beer not for the weak. Beautifully complex, sweet, boozy, charred, malty, and bitter all in one.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Appearance - Pours a deep copper red with two fingers of foamy tan head.    Smell - bready caramalts, toffee, brown sugar, fig, citrus and earthy hops.     Taste - Bready caramalts, toffee, and brown sugar dominate the brew. The fig, citrus and earthy hops help to finish the brew off. There is some warmth as well that comes into play with this one.    Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes with a lingering sweetness alongside a touch of bitterness from the hops. There is also a pleasant warmth from the alcohol.     Overall - Another winner from Stone. Though this beer had more of a malt presence then hop presence it was still a unique brew that displays the malts quite well.

I love this beer. I get booze and sweetness up front w little more sweetness shortly following. mid to late palate hops which gives way to caramel candy malts and a sweet finish. I love this beer. one of my favorites. so complex. I get different flavor profiles each time I quaff one. superior to regular bastard by a long shot. freaking great

The hops fall behind imo.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Aged 2 years    L - murky, opaque brown with a minimal tan head that leaves behind some lacing.   S - very sweet roasted, malty, barely with a twinge of alcohol on the nose. Notes of caramel and vanilla.   T - Complex but follows the nose. Up front you get a good amount of sweet roasted malt/barely with is followed by a good amount of alcohol taste - not an offending amount but that nice kind of warming amount - the kind of amount that provides character. There's also a nice hop character that present - not a crazy IPA bite, but enough to let you know there are hops. There's also nice notes of vanilla, caramel, and biscuit intermixed throughout the notes of roasted barely and alcohol.   F - medium body with a minimal to moderate amount of carbonation. Feels just right for this beer.   O - This is a fantastic beer. Complex flavors (listed above) that while similar to the "Regular" Arrogant Bastard seem amplified here. It's is a no frills in your face, kind of beer in that while the flavors are complex, they are strong; man is it a great and a rewarding experience. Stone, well Arrogant Bastard, really knows how to make them well. This is deservedly world class.

Dark malts, caramel, dark sugar, citrus and spice, some pine earthiness.    Caramelized malt flavor with some citrus hop and spice flavors. Pleasantly lacking the booze profile.    Amped up and malty like the brewer suggests. Big body with some hop tang. Some sugar without the booze.    These big brews don't always appeal to me but this one was drinkable, tasty, and masked the high abv nicely. Good job.

Dark spiced fruit, less coppery, pouring a gorgeous red hue with a pretty chewy feel.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Gorgeous dark ruby clear body with pale burnt orange head, lots of caked-on lace. The aroma is intense with balanced grapefruit, orange, and pine hops flavors, balanced by raisin-like malt. There's a strong element of booze as well. Colder, flavor starts with strong bitter hops, ends with chalky Belgian dark fruit quad-like malt, and pure ethanol notes. As it warms the malt becomes more prominent, to the effect of rendering tastes of sweet fleshy fruit. Body is full, creamy yet sharply carbonated, sometimes astringent, sometimes mouthwatering. Quizzical.  I get trying to be in-your-face, but when you get past the macho attitude and fuck-you-ness, alcohol simply does not smell or taste good, period. That being said, it does have good balance between cozy malt and intense hops, especially at warmer temperatures. A beer to ponder while you're getting your ass kicked.

Mouthfeel is medium and smooth with a bit of oilyness and a nice warming sensation down the throat. Overall, a very good bastard iteration, which I actually like more than depth charged and regular arrogant bastard, but less than my favorite oaked arrogant bastard.

Feel is awesome, super smooth on the palate and incredibly smooth for high 11% abv, dangerous for sure. Overall: enjoyable.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A: Pours a murky amber with a thin khaki head that recedes quickly.    S: Rich aromas of caramel, molasses, biscuit, brown sugar, and sweet cream are quickly balanced by assertive aromas of pine, lemon rind, white grapefruit, blood orange, spruce, grass, herbs, and kumquat. There is no alcohol to speak of on the nose which is pretty impressive considering this beer has an abv of 11%.    T: Incredibly balanced notes of brown sugar, biscuit, sweet cream, nougat, caramel, molasses, pine, spruce, grass, herbs, lemon rind, white grapefruit, blood orange, and kumquat swirl across the palate. The finish is bitter and resinous, offering a slow fade of blood orange, grass, caramel, pungent herbs, pine, lemon rind, and grapefruit before a sneaking alcohol warmth settles in and more or less smooths things out completely.     M: In the mouth, this ale is full-bodied and sticky. Carbonation is delicate, yet active. Alcohol warmth is very restrained. Though a sipping beer, this is one that I could definitely see myself being able to sip steadily and finish quickly. All in all, this is far more drinkable than it should be given the strength.    O: I tend to be pretty generous in my reviews, but I am not even remotely exaggerating when I say that this is the best beer I have had in some time. For a strong ale, it is approachable, yet complex and extremely well-balanced. I really cannot find much about this ale to fault. In the end, I just wish I had made it a point to try this one sooner. If there is anyone out there who has yet to try this beer, make a point to do so in the near future. If you are even remotely a fan of strong ales, you will not regret it.

Big fluffy head, light in color that settles into a smaller fluffy head. Plenty of lacing sticking to the sides of the glass.  Smell - Hints of soft stone fruits, and malt.  Taste - Up front, I got a slight hint booziness, nothing overpowering. Overripe plums, malted grains. Bitterness that reminds me of the flesh of the fruit close to the stone. A little like an English barley wine style, perhaps.  Feel - Creamy.  Overall - Amazing sipper! Opened mine up after an evening shift at the job. Perfect beer to relax with. This is going to be a beer staple. I can't believe it took so long to get to this one.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Bottled on 14-oct-15, consumed on 20-nov-15  I am pretty sure I consumed this when it was past its prime, and because of that I will keep this short. Deep caramel color, thin creamed color head that lingered. Not a great balance between the hops and malts.   Bottom line: wasn't impressed but I would be willing to try again if I could find a fresh bottle

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 2014 Bottle    Look: This Double Bastard has a darker maroon body. The head is thin, light beige in color, and creamy looking. With a twirl of the glass, the lacing sticks nicely to the sides of my favorite 15.5 ounce brandy snifter, creating an artistic blanket of twisted, broke branches.    Smell: The aroma is clearly of sweet figs and sticky, overripe dark fruit.     Taste: The taste is clearly of sweet, overripe dark fruit, which includes mushy raisins, and medium roasted sweet grains. Distant Lemonheads taste. The taste is even keeled, leaning on the sweeter side. The addition of hops balances this out perfectly. The regular Bastard has a much bigger hop profile. This is sweet, but not too sweet for me. Some could say, this is heading toward being called cloying...but maybe not. The level of sweetness is nicely placed. Good balance of tastes. This really opens up as it warms.     Feel: Nothing to complain about. Smooth drinking. For me, the level of carbonation would be a 4 out 10. Lush.    Overall - I need this beer to be available in 12oz bottles. This beer has a place in my heart, as do many other Stone beers, since I am from Escondido. Get some!

It pours a handsome looking medium to dark amber with a long lasting off-white head. Decent clarity.    The aroma is sweet barley malts, caramel, with a bit of booze but not too much. Low to no hop profile on the nose.    Medium to full body.    I get an undercurrent of sweetness in the taste but the alcohol is more forward here. Lingering bitterness. It's a good beer with some bite.

Bubble gum, tangerine, orange, mild grapefruit. There is also a heavy caramel malt. The flavor is really good. I actually find this very well balanced. The malt is very present, but there is plenty of bitterness. There is a mild alcohol presence as well, but that doesn't steel the show. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. All in all, I would call this a top notch brew.

The label is very accurate

Drink this slowly.

Good retention and lots of sticky lacing. Aroma is very good - tropical hop juiciness and rich malts. Taste is really good - definitely a double bastard. Really smooth with a great balance of alcohol, malts, and hops. Mouthfeel is medium/full with moderate carbonation. Very delicious.

(In honor of Fred Eckhardt)    Appearance: Slight haze from proteins that fell out of suspension over the 5 years of aging. Beautiful deep amber orange glow    Aroma: Roses, with peaches and cream. Carmel and burnt molasses. Sourdough bread.    Taste: The beast has mellowed beautifully in both body and maltiness. The bittering hops still leave this beer with a firm bite. The alcohol heat is gone.   It is juicy, slightly sweet, and it finishes bitter. Probably past its peak but still great.    Mouthfeel: On the thinner side from a big beer like this. The age shows in the mouthfeel but it still has a stickiness to it.

More flavor than bitter comes from the hops, but the hop dosage is generous and a lingering hop bitterness balances the malt and the alcohol. Caramel, toffee and cola notes. F: very creamy Medium full body to chewy, medium to medium low carbonation. O: This is an elixir that you might drink instead of a gin and tonic.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Growler into pint glass. Pours a clear, beautiful dark amber, with a thin off-white head. Pretty minimal carbonation. Malt and hops are well-balanced. First impression is malt sweetness and sticky feel, followed by citrus and resinous hops. Hops win the durability contest, lingering on the back of the tongue. Alcohol is pretty well hidden, but it's definitely there.     This is not a subtle brew. Quite drinkable, though. Preferable to Stone's last few "Enjoy By's", IMHO.

Lots of rich malts and moderate hop bitterness in the mid-palate, but not in the finish.    F: Heavy body, medium carbonation. Moderate linger.    O: One of those dangerously drinkable big beers. Not too sweet, not too bitter, just a hint of alcohol bite at the end. Goes down easily.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 brown bottle - 2013 Release    Stone Double Bastard Ale poured out of a 1pt 6fl oz bottle into a tulip glass. A dark amber color body and a 1 1/2 finger foamy tan head was produced. The head reduced to spotty lacing over time. The nose is dominated by sweet caramel and toffee with just a hint of hops in the background. The taste starts off sweet with caramel, dark sugar, and toffee noted. Then the bitterness takes over and very much dominates the sweet malt. The finish is dry with a strong lingering piney bitterness. Mouth feel is high-medium to full bodied and a little sticky.    Double Bastard is a serious big beer that drinks similar to an American Barleywine. The drinkability is lower due to its alcohol presence...a sipper for sure!

S - Great aroma; feign smell of chocolate. Hints of alcohol.    T - Very smooth taste. You can notice the flavor of alcohol faintly. A burnt caramel or toffee flavor with faint hints of orange and chocolate.    F - Leaves a pleasant and dry feeling in the mouth. Mild to no carbonation. Again can note the alcohol in it though doesn't take away from the experience.    O - A great beer with a unique flavor to offer. It lives up to its name in strength, though the flavor of alcohol is barely present. Great choice for the 100th beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 22oz bomber into a Stone Winter Storm taster glass  Noted on 11/07/2014    A: Lightly burnished copper body with some well conditioned clarity. Short filmy cap of khaki foam comes to rest for a few moments until swirling out. Very light on the stick.     S: Nutty scorched caramel toffee with bread crust, earthy hops and a bit of pine and orange peel. Some mild stone fruit like esters present. Nicely balanced between malts and hops with the alcohol kept in good check.     T: Deep malty and rich with a nutty caramelization all throughout. Toffee, plum, and fig notes in spades with dark style bread and biscuit. Some further stone fruit action. The brew has a big hop bitterness that cuts through all the malt sweetness adding in some nice elements of citrus, pine, and spice. Alcohol is well and present with heat but it kind of works in favor of this one. Just one big ass beer yet remarkable balanced and simple to drink.     M: Full bodied and even a touch syrupy at times but with a nice cutting bitterness midway. Finishes out with a fair amount of drying and some stinging alcohol heat.    D: I think Stone did a great job of scaling up the base AB while keeping true to the flavor profile. This is a big sipper for sure but one that is really fun to go rounds with every now and then…especially when you are looking for a one and done type situation. Not for the faint-hearted.

look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A: [3.25] The beer is a dark reddish-brown. It looks like cider just a bit. There is very little in the way of head formation. I cannot find a date on the bottle. The ABV is listed (11%)    S: [4.00] I get brown sugar as the primary note. Then there are smells of caramel and alcohol. Biscuity breadiness in there too.    T: [4.50] The flavor is similar to the nose. It has a prominent breadiness with candied sugar.     M: [4.25] This has a full body and low carbonation. The finish is long and dry but there is no astringency or off flavors. The 11% alcohol is present but not negative.    O: [4.25] I really like the flavor on this beer. The sweetness and the breadiness play off of each other really well. The mouthfeel is nice and rich. I really wish there were some obvious dates - at 11% it probably doesn't matter - but they need to get on board.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 2014 bottling. Poured from a bomber into a nonic pint. This ale is a clear mahogany color and is capped by a lingering 1-finger tan head, supported steady carbonation. Lacing is heavy all the way down the glass    Aroma is malty with toffee-like notes, ripe fruits, alcohol, and woody, pine-y hops. Surprisingly, this doesn't seem as intense on the nose as the standard Arrogant Bastard Ale.    Flavors are intense, to say the least. Big malts up front... brown sugar, caramel, toasted nuts, and raisins. A good bit of hop presence follows, but I certainly wouldn't say this beer is in any way over-hopped, there's so much going on here that the bitterness serves as a perfect counterpoint to everything else. The finish is long and hop-y, but very pleasant.    The mouthfeel is rich, slightly oily like a good booze, but this is a surprisingly strongly carbonated ale, so it's not as thick as one might expect. It's far easier to drink (quickly) than a lot of strong-style ales. The alcohol warms both in the mouth and on the way down, very much like Barleywine.    The "Double Bastard" name might have one expecting an even more challenging version of the classic Arrogant Bastard Ale, but this was quite the opposite for me... This has many of the same qualities that make AB so great, but presented in a more 'refined' way. Mind you, this is still a HUGE ale, not for the faint of heart, but it's not as brashly aggressive as it's sibling. A remarkable example of craft brewing, and something every ale connoisseur should try.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I have heard a ton of great things about this beer but I have always just overlooked it since it's always on the shelf but I finally gave it a try.     A - Deep ruby, chestnut color similar to Bastard but just a few SRM darker. Crystal clear with rocky egg-shell head and strong lacing.    S - First there is a rich malt, caramel aroma with a bitter hoppy character. The alcohol is stronger in this version and there is also a fruity yeast based character but is not like a Belgian beer but noticeable.    T - Big, strong, and complex flavor. First the rich malt hits the palate like a strong ale should but it is more intense and more complex than Bastard. It has a significant bitter hop character that also fights for dominance on the tongue. Pungent bitterness is matched with the strong maltiness and caramel flavor so it doesn't hurt the tongue. The raisin and yeast fruit character is also there and then after the swallow the alcohol reminds you of the >11% ABV.    M - Heavy mouth-feel. High carbonation. It is the highest carbed strong ale I've had which seems to make the flavors pop more and attempts to lighten the mouth feel. The finish is long, bitter, and hot but some how I really enjoyed the complex flavors burning into my memory.    Overall, a perfect example of the style and a tremendous amount of depth in this beer. Great attributes but just like Bastard this could never be my go-to beer. I understand the following and the respect that this beer gets but it's not going in my top 10.    Glass- Tulip

A tad sharp in the finish, but what do you expect for a beer that is 7 years old? I would have this one with something that stands up to it well like aged cheddar. Overall, a very enjoyable beer. If you are holding on to this one, I would not continue to age it.

It tastes very sweet with a tad bit of bitterness. The alcohol is very apparent from the first sip. Mild carbonation. I aged it for about 6 months prior to consuming. It was okay, but too boozy for me.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Bomber poured into a nonic pint glass. A gentle and perhaps understated mahogany brown with an orange halo near the bottom of the glass and a single finger of thick, creamy tan foam on top.     Aroma is redolent with burnt sugar, pineapple rings, and piney hops. Deceptively mellow on the nose, at least at first. Does create the impression of hidden power. The first sip reveals layer upon layer of caramel (burnt and raw, co-existing), pineapple juice, papaya spears, spruce needles, mango, and a huge bloom of alcohol that gathers steam over the course of multiple sips. Obviously recalls "single Bastard" but more compressed, if that makes sense ... A deeper, more nutty malt backbone with around the same level of aggressive hopping. All the accolades heaped upon Arrogant Bastard apply here, although I am finding that the hops pop out less due to the richer malts and the booze flavor is amped up a few notches. Not a problem. Getting big pecan and walnut flavors about half way through, along with a little chocolate cake.     Body translates as quite thick, although the beer somehow remains rather attenuated in feel. Smooth. Finishes boozy and pleasantly astringent, with some resinous hops waving goodbye.     Much what one familiar with Stone would expect ... Delivers the goods, memorable, deserves its good reputation. Very late I am getting a return to the tropical fruit vibe detected earlier, thus coming full circle. Not much more one can ask.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25 Appearance: Extremely turbid amber with an off-white head that didn’t last too long.    Smell: A bit of piney hops, faint floral smell. Mostly yeast and bread.    Taste: Mellow bitterness up front, into a dry malt backbone, again tons of yeast flavor. If you’ve had the normal Arrogant Bastard you’ll recognize the distinct flavor. Surprisingly little booze flavor at the end.    Mouthfeel: Pretty thick with low carbonation.    Overall: A nice hearty ale. I had this about a year after the bottling date, but it was still delicious. Good balance between yeast, malt, and hops (mostly just providing bitterness at this point). I agree 100% with a lot of the reviews: this is incredibly smooth and easy to drink for an 11.2% ABV beer. If you liked Arrogant Bastard then there is no reason not to try this one; it really is appropriately named.

Smells like my Grandmothers Christmas Cake. Aging has mellowed out the hoppyness that was more present when it was fresh. Booziness has also mellowed. Next time I'll only age it for 6-8 months max to preserve a little better balance of the hops/malts. .

Poured a very nice dark, roasted amber. Almost red, yet, almost brown. Barely any head whatsoever, mild carbonation. Smelll is weak, but hints of hops, citrus, lemon, orange, and apples. The first sip sent a chill down my spine. Very hoppy, with hints of spices. Also citrus/lemon is pretty apparent to me. Leaves with a dry finish. Lingering zest and hops after every sip.    I really wanted to like this beer, especially after being a fan of the original Arrogant Bastard Ale. But honestly, this one is just too much. I tried this by itself and with food, and it just dominates no matter what. Simply stronger than I prefer my beer. I decided to try it given the World Class rating, but it just didn't do it for me. Should've taken heed to the warning on the back I guess.    ----    Revisited! A year later after I learned a thing or two! Same bottle date, re-revisited on February 14th, 2016.     Bottle into a New Belgium snifter. Dark amber on the pour, and settles as a transluscent, brownish-amber in the glass. Opaque-bodied, with highlights 'round the edges. Virtually no head, only a thin, whispy lacing. Sweet on the nose with notes of figs, raisins, leather, red and white grapes, oak, vanilla, caramel, and clove spice. Let's taste this beast.     Immediately, booze and hops. Charred, peppery hops, ripened grapefruit, sweet citrus, black, bready malt, old leather, burnt oak, spiked vanilla, chewy caramel, and love. Holy crap, this beer is still gigantic and assertive. Even 1.5 years later, there are still a ton of hops to be had. This will twist your face from one side to the other. How can one beer be so sweet and so bitter the same time? Whoof. Incredible mouthfeel; inherently dense and menacing, yet dangerously drinkable. Only a tad bit of alcohol sharpness in there.     Overall, this beer shows me how my palate has changed. I hated this the first time around. Now, I feel like I can finally appreciate what this Bastard has to offer. This beer is a legend in its own right. Numbers adjusted.

look: 4.75 | smell: 2.25 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3 Poured into a standard, British pint glass.    A - 4.75 - Pours a lovely, rich, dark rust and ruby color. Forms about a finger of quickly dissipating, medium tan colored head. Whispy lacing left on the walls of the glass.  S - 2.25 - Smell is pretty boring to me. Light touches of malt and hops with a strong imperial pilsner aroma.   T - 3 - Beer is quite a malt bomb, definitely needs time to age even though the labeling states to enjoy fresh as well. Upfront there are sweet extremely malty tones, reminiscent of an imperial IPA that has sat too long, but in someway you can tell it is intentional here. This fades into the classic, over the top hoppy bitterness Arogant Bastard is known and loved for. There are some more subtle notes of things like raisins and dark fruits in the back, but these but is just too malty for me.  F - 3.75 - Decent bodied beer.   O - 3 - Middle of the road score here. Wish I had let it age a bit longer, but Stone should not encourage the drinking of this beer fresh on their bottle! I think more breweries should follow in the footsteps of Deschutes and put a best AFTER date on their bottle! All in all, and OK beer as is, can taste potential with some aging though!

Sweet caramel, toffee, burnt sugar aroma. Slight citrus hops. Alcohol that is not overpowering.  Sweet on the tongue, smooth, full bodied, softly carbonated and almost viscous. Caramel malts, toffee, dark fruit and chocolate with a strong but not overpowering alcohol content. The bittering hops begin to coat the mouth to create balance. The finish is dry. There is lots of alcohol warming.  An amazing beer. I thought that Arrogant Bastard is a bit more drinkable and has a more interesting hops profile. This one is more of a sipper yet still very drinkable. I truly enjoyed.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 On tap at Donnelly's Public House in Fairport, NY.    Pours a clear dark brown, with a half inch head, and a little bit of lacing.    Smells like burnt pine, wood, leather, caramel, and toffee.    This is essentially a hoppy barleywine. It's much better than Arrogant Bastard, if I can be honest. It tastes like burnt pine, wood, leather, caramel, toffee, bready malt, brown sugar, with a pretty heavy bitterness.    This is medium bodied, with a crisp, bready mouthfeel, and a moderate level of carbonation. The bitterness lingers really strongly after each sip.    This is really an excellent beer. I didn't think I'd like it much after not loving Arrogant Bastard, but this is much better.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a ruby amber with about a thumb's worth of head. The head breaks relatively quickly, but the drinker is left with wispy islands of foam and some very nice lacing. The nose is piney hops and caramel malts, with some brown/turbinado sugars and perhaps a touch of citrus as well. The taste is more malt forward than hop forward, which is slightly unexpected given my history with Stone beers. The hops on the finish are a bit piney and grassy with a nice bitterness, and this gives a nice balance to the beer. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, higher carbonation and perhaps a little chewy.    All in all, a very nice beer. This bottle neither fresh nor "aged" as is had about six months on it. I found the balance spot on. Should I have had it fresh? Well that is a discussion for another day. In the meantime, I have another one that I will let sit for a while and try it with age on it.

Food Pairing    This wonderful big beer went well with....... Chicken wings with medium hot sauce. Blue cheese really pairs well.    Enjoy

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 2014   I have a more fully developed palette since I drank it last time    This time, all I taste is malts, malts, and malts with a hint of malts. Aside from the malts, this is still a really good beer. I drank it at around 13C and you can definitely taste the fruitiness of the body. You can barely taste the alcohol.

look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Bottle from 2014 Stone box set:  Nice mostly clear ruby brown color. Head grows thick and lasts, lacing the glass with copious amounts of residual head that clings. Nose is a tad weak, but has some sweet candy-like notes (dark cherry-ish), some dark fruit, but an abundance of hops bite (woody, even piney).    The taste does have a certain boldness of hops, but is a bit more balanced than I expected (but not actually balanced). This is a Stone Arrogant Bastard, after all. Cola-like candy flavor is the first taste that hits. It turns with the addition of hops bitterness into an earthy flavor, almost a bit of coffee ice cream flavor for a fleeting moment before the hops reach their full power. Woody in nature, the hops just linger with the candy flavor, providing a weird long-term taste that isn't my favorite. Body is fairly full, carbonation plays perhaps just a tad too much.    Not a big flavor profile difference than regular Arrogant Bastard, I don't think (even if I described them differently). The final hop/candy flavor is just off-putting enough for me to rate it any higher.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 22oz bomber into tulip    Appearance - Looks like practically every other beer in the Bastard line-up: Murky dark red/brown with a big 2 finger tan head that retains for a long time and leaves awesome lacing.    Smell - Caramely, toasty malts with a musty, sweet fruitiness. Some piney hops hide underneath. Booze is all over the more, but in the most mellow, pleasant of ways.    Taste - Not half as abrasive as I was expecting... The high alcohol content really tempers the flavors. Sweet, caramely, toasty malts are up front with LOADS of musky fruitiness and nuances of yeasty spice and cocoa. The hops reinforce the somewhat tropical fruitiness, then begin to creep in to balance with a well-rounded pine and citrus bite. Finishes semi-sweet with toasty malt sweetness hanging on tightly and moderate pine resin bitterness that seems to build; a slight alcohol burn lets you know this is a huge beer. Otherwise, any specific fusel booziness is nonexistant.    Feel - Decidedly, this is a full bodied monster of a beer with a viscous feel that coats the mouth. Thankfully the carbonation is executed perfectly - smooth and creamy but ample enough to lighten the feel, which is quite drinkable for a beer of this heft. Awesome.    Overall - Finishing a bomber of this isn't just "having a beer", it's an event. Super flavorful, super complex, this Bastard is much more well-rounded than I thought it would be: the huge flavors really marry together well and the booze is ridiculously well integrated. The musty fruitiness of this beer almost reminds me of a Belgian quad. A bit sweeter than I'd prefer, this is still one hell of a brew by Stone, I'm impressed (and a little buzzed).

Appearance: Pours a ruby garnet with 1/2 finger of off-white head and a fine lace    Smell: Hops with a lot of pine and earthy hop aromas    Taste: Hop bitterness up front with a lot of earth tones similar to the aroma and finishes with caramel and toffee notes    Mouthfeel: Medium but lighter and not as sticky as the ABV would suggest    Overall: A fantastic winter sipper that I look forward to. I haven't had it cellared but when fresh there is an overwhelming hop bitterness and flavor that is enjoyable. The hoppiness helps to balance the high alcohol content. I personally find this to have a real "old-school" hop flavor. A lot of earth and pine notes as opposed to something like Enjoy by IPA.

Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, pine, raisin, plum, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, light nuttiness, floral, grass, and floral/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, pine, raisin, plum, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, light nuttiness, floral, grass, and floral/toasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, pine, raisin, plum, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, light nuttiness, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine hops and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and moderately creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome strong ale style. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of citrus/pine hops and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 220z poured into snifter    A: Gorgeous murky Carmel color like a brackish brown nice head and it finishes into a ring around the beer and then it laces the glass to the finish    S: like a resiny hoppy mess it just smells like it's going to make you pucker it's piney Sticky smell     T: It's dripping hops and full on your face bitter with a smooth malt back bone that eases the bitterness into nothing. It's shocking this beer you just expect to be bitter and abrasive but it's smooth.     M: has full to medium feel     O: I had this last year and it was more abrasive in your face. this year it's smoother I'm not sure it's a bad thing. It's so smooth it's smell promises sticky and bitter but the taste is there without the over-the-top ness of bitterness.

A-Red brown clear colour with a tan head that quickly dissipates   S-At 11%, alcohol hits the nose! along with a malty prune and disguised spice  M-Carbonation is light and let's the alcohol through  T-Malty, toasted goodness,gets balance of bitter and sweet with a soar note  O-Drank this fresh, not aged, I wish I had bought another or store in the cellar. Delicious beer that packs a punch, full bodies and very complex flavour. It takes some solid brain power to digest this wonderful beer, highly recommend.

Quick review-    I found Double Bastard to be less appealing than regular Arrogant.     The 11+% ABV is not noticed, which is neither here nor there. But the taste is simply too sweet for my liking.        (Lukcy Bastard > Double by a full rating point- IMO.)

There is no way to add to over 2000 (at this writing) reviews. This is from a 2014 version, 22 oz.    The aroma lets you know you are in for it. Malts, some bitter hiding in there, and 11AVB you can feel in the back cavity of your nostrils. Big, malty goodness up front, with more in the finish. Some balancing bitter to cut the stickiness. The finish coats the tongue with the caramel maltiness but burns it good on the way down.    This will punch you in the mouth because you asked for it.

First time drinking this beer. Strong hops, strong malt presence. Interesting aroma, similar to what RR sours smell like... some sort of fermented apple scent. Very complex taste, bitter fades but the malt lingers for quite awhile. Alcohol presence is there, but actually not too strong for something around 11%. Definitely a sipper.   
Bought the Bastard box on a whim, haven't had many of these for awhile except for a couple enjoy boy's.   Too bad that a lot of these don't get the love that the rare beers get. Inexpensive, and quite delicious.$5 a bomber in this pack.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Draft. So good. Poured a nice, caramel-like copper color. Nice, sweet aromas from the glass. This was a nice surprise of hop aggressiveness, which I love, with a sweet barleywine finish! A new favorite from Stone, and worth the wait to try.

Plenty of good reviews have already been written on this beer in standard beer-review format so I decided to write a haiku about this one:    beautiful red brown  bitter creamy malty booze  I am satisfied

Poured from 22oz on 11/24/14 into tulip glass; bottled 10/24/14    A: murky, brown-amber with a 1/4", light tan head that lasts only for a few minutes except for the edges of the glass. A far amount of lacing throughout consumption.    S: An initial, punchy blend of of maltiness and hops, pseudo-sweet (raisin) and a hint of fresh-from-the-oven bread, and grapefruity-citrus. A slight wiff of alcohol lures you in just as much as it may scare you away.     T: Living up to the 'liquid arrogance' moniker posted all over the fun label, this one isn't for the faint of heart. The amount of maltiness here is generally a bit higher than I like, but is cut and balanced well with the same aggressiveness from the hopiness. A bit of carmel upfront with citrus on the finish leading to a fairly complex taste that enjoyably lingers for a few seconds. The maltiness calms a bit as this one warms.    M: Deliciously smooth carbonation with a medium to full body    O: A lot of beer within a beer as you might expect from the name and description. Surprisingly balanced, as the 1-2 punch I hoped for. Not for the faint of heart and worth trying if you enjoy other Stone offerings. Aging may mellow out the aggressive profiles, but I'd hesitate to make it maltier than it already is.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 22 oz. bottle, vintage 2014, bottled on date 10/14/2014 printed on the bottleneck. My first encounter with the Stone Double Bastard. A long ridiculous nonsensical rant printed on the bottle, as always. My bottle lists an 11.00% abv. Not entirely sure what to expect here.    Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.    A - It pours a muddled ruby reddish colored body. Less than a finger of soft tan head that goes down quick. Some minor spotty sticky lacing on the glass. It comes off in appearance as a thick and heavy beer.    S - The aroma is sweet and malty - caramel, toffee, and brown sugar, with dank resinous hop notes - pine, grapefruit, tea leaves. Some mild solventy alcohol presence is    T - Sweet & herbal. Tea leaves, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, pine, resins, grapefruit, notes of wood & vanilla present themselves.    M - The feel is fairly smooth and creamy, mildly bitter, resinous, and piney on the finish. Semi-dry. Very easy drinking though, despite the high 11.00% abv. Full-bodied with good moderate carbonation.    Overall, a tasty, layered, rich, and complex beer that grows on me more as it warms. Definitely recommended drinking, and I would for sure be interested to see what some serious age would do to one of these bottles.    Stone Double Bastard Ale -----4/5.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Deep amber with excellent clarity. A trace of khaki colored foam covers the majority of the top of the beer, and especially around the rim of the glass. Aroma is comprised of plenty of amber malt and a bit of alcohol. The flavor is intensely malty and alcoholic. There's a warmth on the tongue that becomes a slight burn in the fade and you are left with the aftertaste of intense maltiness. A malty alcoholic bomb. Not my thing.

Appearance: Medium brown in color    Smell: The aromatics on this beer are great you can smell the hops, grapefruit, pine and a hint of alcohol.    Taste: This medium bodied beer is great. Good hoppie bitterness and you can taste the chocolate malts and roasted flavors and the alcohol is like a smooth whiskey.     Mouth feel: it goes down smooth, if your not use to hoppie beers, keep to your fuzzy wussies beers like the bottle say, cause your not worthy.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 Poured from a 22oz 2014 release bottle into a snifter.  Appearance - a cloudy, mahogany with noticeable sediment; a thin, beige head that leaves fairly weak lacing.  Smell - booze, caramel, oak, brown sugar, maple syrup.  Taste - unique, complex and flavorful! Characteristics of both an Imperial IPA and a Quad!  Feel - demands another sip due to it's complexity! Bold, bulky, and undeniably brash! Boozy, but hidden well; aggressively bitter!  Overall - a brilliantly crafted ale, worthy of it's very high praise.

I just drank a high ABV maple syrup minus the pancake. Might be a good breakfast beer. Hmmm..

A - A dark amber with a redish tint. Almost no head and minimal bubbles. Barely any light passes through.    S - Malts, citrus fruit, sweet and fruity.    T - A malty and sweet front that transforms into a mild bitter aftertaste. Alcohol taste is strong.    M - Smooth, heavy body. Not a lot of carbonation, some alcohol burn.    O - The smooth heavy body combined with the malty sweet taste makes for a pleasant drink. The bitterness is fairly mild, which I like.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 2013 Realease    A - Pours a hazy brown with a one-finger off-white head. Light soapy lacing.    S - Aroma of caramel malts, brown sugar, toffee, and dark fruits.    T - Taste starts off sweet with brown sugar, toffee, and caramel malts. The is a good deal of piney hops mid palate. The finish is bitter hops and an alcohol burn.    M - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Syrupy mouthfeel with a sticky dry finish.    O - This is a big beer with big flavors. This is a slow sipper that really opens up as it gets warmer.   
As a former resident of Southern California, now living in New York City I can't believe I waited so long to try this phenomenal ale. These World-Class ratings are spot on by both the Bros and the BA score. So smooth, yet it tastes fresh with hoppy flavor. This beer leaves my mouth watering for more and more with ever sip I take.

Delicious. I'm arbitrarily docking points for being less drinkable than the original, but it isn't designed to be consumed in quantity anyway. Tons of flavor, tons of ABV, outstanding beer.
