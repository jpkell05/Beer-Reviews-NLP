Every year I shrug and just stick it in the fridge. When the day finally comes that I get a wild hair and decide to crack it open, Im reminded that this is actually a pretty decent beer. Its pretty hoppy but its relatively smooth for being so hoppy. By the time I down my 12 oz. allotment I always find myself wishing they gave me more than one Racer 5.

A bad sign on the 1st sip when I wonder whether I can finish it.  M- Intensely hoppy dry, with perfumed notes wafting in afterwards.  O- It's out of balance to me. More like a challenge than an assured and balanced brew.  Bought from M+S at Paddington Station W2. Perhaps aimed at US commuters >< the 'Silicon Triangle' of US corporate offices out to the west from there. No visible BB. £2.75/330ml    Observation: The hoppier a beer, the shorter the reviews people write on it - ?

Feel is fairly light. Overall, I know this is a favorite but I have had better west coast style IPAs. Not bad but I would not seek it out.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 It pours a straw yellow with a foamy white head with good retention and nice lacing on the glass. The smell is of pine and citrus ( grapefruit) to me. The taste is of citrus to begin with and pine then flows, it has a good hop bitterness. The feel leaves a dry feeling from the hops but is smoother than you would expect. Overall a really good IPA, smooth and bitter at the same time.

Sample is a 22 oz from the bottle, served at 37F, in a coozy, while watching a Dodger /Brewers baseball play off game. Very nice pine, citrus and a medium hoppy feel up front. A little thick feeling on my palate. Flavor improves a bit in the citrus department as the beer gets a little closer to room temperature. Consumed over 55 minutes. Citrus and grapefruit and pine finish really stand out as the beer approaches room temperature. No idea what the IBu's are on this one, not really overly hoppy, but has, IMHO, a very well rounded, balanced taste, flavor and finish. Really, really enjoy this IPA. Been drinking it now for a few years, this is the first time I've tried to review it. Great example of a good West Coast style medium flavored and bodied IPA. A keeper. Balanced, I think describes it best. Very well balanced.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Pours a frosty, lightly foggy orange with a finger of off-white, foamy head. Head retention is fair. Aroma is pine, citrus, dank, and resin forming a classic IPA aroma. Citrus bodes well with the more evergreen-like hops. Biscuit, bread, and pale malts behind further mellow it out. Flavor profile is a lovely blend of biscuit, bread, and pale malts with resin, dank, and citrus hops. The duo works together well to form a hoppy, but balanced IPA. Hop notes are firmly on the traditional/classical side. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a fizzy texture that imparts a little grainy abrasiveness around the edges. This mash up of textures with the slightly thicker feel creates a rather bold mouth feel overall. Overall, this is a great classic IPA. Hop notes are plentiful, but are well balanced out by malts. Neither one side dominates the experience.     Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.

I have passed this beer on my way to get other beers to think I have drunk that. Sadly, I learned the other day I have not drunk this classic. I nabbed this beer today as I doing shopping for a BIF. The beer is 43 degrees and served in a pint glass. A firm pour on the beer produced a two finger head with excellent retention. The head is bright white foamy and rocky. The color of the beer is a straw color with golden hues. The clarity of the beer is clear. The beer is active with effervesce.     The aromas in the beer are grapefruit, pine, citrus, toasted malt, and yeast.     The flavors in the beer are pine, citrus, grapefruit, toasted malt, and yeast.     The mouthfeel of the beer is astringent and dry.     The body of the beer is medium, medium carbonation, and a medium finish.     A great IPA simple flavors and tasty.

Tastes of hoppy goodness - mainly floral and herbal but also some fruity zest in the background - as well as biscuit, grain and a great malt backbone. Great smooth finish with nice mouthfeel and just the right amount of carbonation. I will definitely check out other beers from this brewery.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5 Have been wanting to try this beer for quite a long time and now finally I was able to find it. Although it wasn't a fresh batch anymore, I was absolutely satisfied with it and do agree that it lives up to its fame!  Looks: perfectly rich hazy golden amber. Smells suggest citrus and pine that comes to life richly in its flavor: hop galore. Citruses and mostly pine that dominates with a certain character that makes it distinct and different from the rest. It is very well balanced, no wateriness, no weak spots but not too hardcore either - a perfrct balance of pleasantly drinkable brew all the way, without a flaw. Nomen est omen: a number 5 IPA in overall. This is Racer 5! Go! Go! Go!

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottle, plastic hotel cup, best by 6/28/18 (come on Bear Republic, use a packaged on date!!!).     Racer 5 is the color of honey and has a delicate white head of about a finger. The lacing is nice.     The aroma is sharp, the oily citrus hops are like sharp edges to the olfactory sense. Resin plays around the edges.     Hops and carbonation combine for a biting sip. After that comes the hop assault with orange, grapefruit, and resin as bitterness and malt roll further and further back. The malt is caramel, but savory or rather a bit biscuity, which helps contain that cheap sweetness.     It's the mouthfeel that makes this beer. It is all at once crisp, biting, tangy, and full. There's plenty of carbonation.     When I picked up this six pack and checked just to make sure I'd reviewed this home state brew, I was surprised to see I had not. It's a pleasure to get reacquainted with one of the original great West Coast IPAs.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Yes it is a classic hoppy West Coast IPA, clean and well crafted, but I find it too one-note and overly bitter. As it warms and breathes it certainly mellows out and by the end of a bomber I was appreciating it as a pretty delightfully balanced drink; however, this journey took too long and my senses were probably dulled by that time.   It is alive with juicy, tropical, citrusy, and piney hops and all those notes are great but for the puckering bitterness.

Upped my rating after buying some bottles, trying it at home where i could actually take time with it, and really enjoyed it. Now i wonder what that restaurant was doing to it.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a glass goblet. Clear, deep golden color, with a thick white head that left loads of sticky lacing as it settled to a thin ring. Light caramel up front on the aroma, with pine resin and citrus notes. Similar flavor profile, with slight malt sweetness providing structure for the piney and resiny hops. Good carbonation, medium mouthfeel, lots of bitterness lingering on the tongue. My sample may have been slightly past its prime, but still solid and highly drinkable.

The beer pours just slightly hazy and golden in color. The head is off white and leaves abundant lacing on its way to a firm 1/4" cap. Aroma is fairly big with grapefruit and caramel mixed equally. The taste is semisweet caramel up front with citrus and pine playing in. The finish is crisp and drying with a nice bitter exclamation point. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and a little chalky(in a pleasant way). Overall, excellent. Really glad I had the opportunity to pick this up fresh and on the shelf. Perfect balance of hops and caramel malt. Recommended.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Serving: 12 oz bottle (stamp illegible) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass.    Appearance: Slightly hazy golden orange. Billowing head of bubbly white foam with sticky rings of lace.    Smell: Light, citrus aroma with herbal hops and grainy malt.    Taste: The lean biscuit malt body does its best to balance the bright, lemon citrus and pine hop notes.     Mouthfeel: Medium body with slightly oily, creamy feel and moderate yet soft carbonation.    Overall: Quintessential West Coast IPA - just enough malt body to support a refreshing burst of pine and citrus hop.

Grapefruit dominates the aroma, but not offensively so - it is simply string and present until the end. Biscuit-like malt aromas are secondary but have a definite presence.    This is a full-flavored beer. There's enough malt to counterbalance the abundant grapefruit and there's a very refreshing minty/herbal component to the taste that brightens things up. There is just enough sweetness to keep the bitter tamed down, and a very slight biscuit contribution from the malt. Very round, complete taste.    The mouthfeel is smooth, moderate body, not thin at all. Carbonation appropriate to the sty.e    Overall this is an enjoyable beer to drink. The flavor is full and fresh, nothing sticks out at the expense of any component in particular. This is simply a very good beer.

There's hops in the nose, hops in the taste, and there would be hops in the sound if it had one. Pine zing. The malts are underneath and they follow but primarily (for me at least) in their presence is the sense of sweetness and heft that is there but not in the spotlight. Not to self - research the difference between IPA and DIPA... does this not tread the line a little bit?    A great measuring post for IPAs.

Tasty light corn-like malts and light zesty citrus from unfiltered California goodness all living in a bottle. Finish is superb. Dry but perfectly so.   This went down the best one year straight from the bottle, in cold weather on the lake going for striped bass. It'll always be a go-to for that reason. Not long ago the brewery yanked itself from TX due to their state's critical drought, but I've seen it appear as of lately so it seems all is good again for when I need a highly-drinkable world class IPA.

Piercing citrus-pine scent, followed by a second malty wave.     Taste follows the nose, the creamy herbal malt subdues the piercing pine aspect. Subtle grapefruit, ending with moderate carbonation. To me, only slightly bitter.     For a 7.5% it went rather swift and smooth. No surprises, no complaints.

Having this on tap in Boston was like a sipping ambrosia straight from the heavens. Bright citrus with a smooth bitterness and a dry finish - the template for an awesome West Coast IPA. Amber pour with a soft head that sticks around for a couple minutes. Aroma of orange peel, grapefruit and pine (the 1-2-3 classic combo). Taste orange, grapefruit pith, pine, toasted malt with an herbal tea kicker. Nice lingering bitterness cleans out the sip. A gold standard for the West Coast IPA that has remained true while my (and many others') palate has changed after prolonged beatings from IPA after IPA, like waves eroding a beach. Doesn't change what the beer brings to the table.

Good piney and citrus flavor with a stronger malt backbone. One of those beers that actually tastes as good as it smells. Medium carbonation and mouthfeel. Something missing on the end of this flavor compared to the Head Hunter I had earlier. I think the malts lean just the slightest bit towards caramel which is not my favorite in an IPA.

A classic IPA that I've wanted to try for a long time....    A: Poured into an IPA glass. Bottle conditioned. A rich golden-amber hue with hazy floating sediment and good carbonation. Produces a large head of fluffy white foam that lasts for a while before reducing to a persistent surface layer. Nice lacing.    S: Aroma of intense resinous hops with notes of pine, dank weed, floral hints, citrus peel, vague tropical fruit, sweet malt, mild earthy yeast and more than a whiff of booze. Nice.    T: Tastes of bitter pine-laden hops with hints of resin, dank weed, grapefruit, citrus peel, floral notes, sweet malt, earthy yeast and a touch of booze in the background. A strident hoppy bitterness upon swallowing.    M: Mouthfeel is smooth and tingly, with pleasant carbonation and nice body. Hop oils stimulate the palate. Aftertaste of bitter hop notes, sweet malt and yeast.    O: Excellent - a top notch American IPA with a well deserved reputation. Looks great, while the aroma and flavour are a satisfying blend of intense aromatic hops, sweet malt and yeast. The only minor flaw is the slightly excessive alcoholic note. Good body. Goes down all too easily - deserves to be sampled if you have the chance.

Now I think I might have gotten the best pick of the store.    Pours a ember-like hazy orange color with 2 finger soapy head that settles down quickly to a half finger. Truly impressive color.    Aroma is hoppy citrus and resin - strong but not overpowering - and a touch of pee which I do not appreciate.    Taste is hop forward but with a strong malt backbone too - nice combination that play well together. Moderately bitter with a strong resinous, almost dank, earthy taste that lingers well into the aftertaste and coats the tongue. That's the real treat of this beer.    Feel is crisp with a little stickiness    Overall this is a great beer obviously crafted to a fine degree. I feel fortunate to have found some way out on the right coast.     ** For god's sake, don't drink this out-of-the-fridge cold! It needs to mellow to get the full flavor bloom, otherwise you are cheating yourself.

Aroma has a tremendous amount of bubblegum (JuicyFruit) uptop with some flowering hop notes drifting underneath. Starts out pretty herbal with some hibiscus notes before the mid-palate brings a some piney hop punch - got lots of Chinook on it - before finishing out with some hop oil flavor. Sweet malt presence throughout helps keep it tempered. Finishes moderately bitter.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 355 ml bottle, Brewdog Bristol - Pours golden with a medium white foamy head. Nice lacing. Medium carbonation. Aroma - hoppy citrus forefront - grapefruit/orange notes, light resin back drop. Taste - similar to aroma, citrus front, light resin on the mouthfeel, crisp fresh light bitter finish. Really enjoyed this. Quality example of an American IPA.    355 ml bottle, M and S, Bristol - Not as good as above as I can't find any of the resin notes from above and it feels a lot maltier than I remember. Bottle has EXPORT printed and wondering whether the recipe has changed for export markets ? If so think it is a turn for the worse. Will keep my rating based on the bottle above but probably won't be buying again.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Bear Republic is one of those California treasures I miss since I have moved to Texas. The wonderful in-laws on their recent trip to the last great state brought up boxes of Racer 5 and that will make both me and my wife extremely happy. Racer 5 has a beautiful cloudy and bright colour with a heavy nose that may intimidate non IPA drinkers or people who don't like hoppy beer. Do not be turned off by the aromas of wonderfulness for those that don't appreciate hops this beer has a strong yet, smooth and easy to drink flavor. It is very hoppy however, it has delicate nuances of orange with a crisp mouth feel and a bright aftertaste that will not overstay its visit. Racer 5 is one of those rare IPA's where a pro can enjoy it's masterfully unique and esoteric flavours and a new IPA drinker or maybe those who don't consider themselves IPA fans will pour a glass and perhaps fill their fridges. Racer 5 is a 5/5 in every category except it is not easy to find west of the Sierra's and can sometimes be difficult to buy in Southern California. Until these puppies run out though we have a beautiful house full of Racer 5 and that makes me a happy camper. Geonbae!!!!

Being on the east coast I wasn't familiar with Bear Republic Picked one up at a grocery near Wilmington, Delaware a few months ago. Since then I have been picking up this classic IPA on a regular basis. Poured one tonight into a pint glass. Nice coloring and beautiful smell. Taste is smooth and hoppy. I always end wanting to open another one.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 I'm trying to rate this objectively, because honestly, it's not really my thing. Pours a semi-cloudy light gold. Little bit of a white head but not much lacing. Aroma is more malt forward - some citrus and piney hops - nothing exhilarating. Taste is balance between sweet malts and some hops, with a moderately bitter finish. Feel is smooth, but a little under-carbonated for my taste. Overall, I feel this is more suited for people who like things that are less hop-forward. Hop-lovers beware, this may not be up your alley. It's a clean tasting brew, but a little too gentle for the IPA style.

Faint aroma of floral hops. Nice medium body and mouthfeel. Surprisingly strong taste of alcohol. Further tastes of light floral and herbal hops, medium bitterness that lingers for a while. Also tasting nice malt flavor, more so than in most IPAs these days. Not what I was expecting, a little disappointed after all of the hype... but a decent malty IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a very nice golden color with a medium size head. The nose has strong pine elements but also some faint mango aroma to it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 A hazy almost burnt orange with a finger of white soapy head that settles down to a ring and leaves some spotty lacing behind. Orange is the biggest scent I get in the aroma, but lots of other fruit qualities like lemon, grapefruit, stone fruits, and tropical fruits, big time. A little of that dank weed vibe, as well. Just fantastic smelling, and the flavor isn't a let down either. Same deal. Really nice hop forward and without that astringent thing going on. The feel is medium body, juicy, dry, and there is a good full level of carbonation. I've seen this beer a few times in my travels but this is the first chance to have a fresh bottle. Really good stuff, here.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 355ml bottle poured into a pint glass.    Hazy orange amber in color, the pour builds up massive silky white head that holds strong will to stand with excellent retention. It just slowly dissipates to an eternal frothy layer atop along with several refined lacing ring, patch, and spot along the way down. There are sediments floating around.    Very fresh, juicy, yet fruity aroma by its hoppy goodness, I am reminded of citrus, grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, passion fruit, kaffir lime, pine, resin, floral, spice, and slight earthy. Yes, it is truly hop bombardment. Malt is there too in the back end with a biscuit character to slight caramel.    Very well balance, hop still prevails but it is not too harsh while biscuit and caramel malt try to bring in sweetness and creaminess to reinforce as supporting. All the hop characters in the aroma also reflect in the taste together with steady bitterness at the end of the sip that also nicely lingers in the aftertaste.    The body is full with smooth mouthfeel from its lively carbonation generated some crisp and refreshing feel upon the palate, pleasantly dry finish that will lead you to another quick quaff.    Great IPA indeed, all the characters, they harmoniously exhibit in great order. Alcohol is very well concealed making it equipped with evil quaffing quality. This one is surely a must, the quintessential of AIPA.

In today's world, it's still an excellent beer but it doesn't really do anything extraordinary or even better than any of the host of other classic IPAs from CA and Oregon, among others.     It has all the tropical fruit notes you're going to expect in the aroma category. In addition, it has some oniony dank alium character which was all the rage for a few years back in the day but is now somewhat quaint. Worth trying, especially on draft, but I'm not going out of my way to procure a six pack.

Aromas of fresh peaches, with grapefruit, papaya, mango, and faint onion trailing at the end.     Flavor is very fruity, leading off with some mango and orange, but then takes a turn towards dumpster bin, tasting like a mismatch of garlic, onion skins, and old toffee. The old toffee and garlic remain on the palate after the swallow. Thing is, I still keep wanting to drink it for the first part of the taste.     Feel is rich, creamy, spiked with some decent carbonation. The finish is dry and musky, leaving a nice parch behind.     Overall, Racer 5 is a good pale ale. I'm glad I have an extra, but I don't think I'd spend money on a six pack or bomber.

Smell - a lot of citrus in the form of orange and grapefruit, there are also strong bready and caramel malty notes, and slight pine resin.  Taste - hops dominate with grapefruit and pine resin overpowering the palate, but there is a nice malty backbone too.  Feel - great carbonation, smooth, and full body that helps the flavors linger on.  Overall, this IPA is stellar. It looks great, has a well-rounded aroma and flavor profile, and has an incredible mouthfeel that helps bolster the complexity.

I'm getting mango, sweet orange, zesty grapefruit rind and a gentle, yet dank hop resin profile.    Taste: Incredibly well balanced but still bitter enough to let you know you're drinking an IPA. Spicy with notes of white pepper and grapefruit. Flavors of orange and mango. A light, buiscity malt bill plays a helping hand in the background contributing notes of vanilla and some creamy flavors to complement the tropical and resinous taste.     Feel: Medium body with light carbonation. Well balanced and smooth, especially for an IPA. Highly drinkable. Hides it's abv exceptionally well.    Overall Comments: If you call yourself a fan of IPAs and you haven't tried this one already, you're missing out. This is the type of beer you can drink over and over again, any time, any occasion. Really great stuff.

Smell is citrus hops (not too much, though) and faint caramel malts. Taste follows the nose dead-on...but with a bit more pine character from the hops. Feel is great and very drinkable. Will definitely be sharing this one with friends in the future.

As it pours melon, tropical fruit, light bread crust and slight dank earthy aromas rise from the glass. The palate starts with melon, light biscuit to bread crumb and citrus flavors that linger. The malt flavors have a light sweetness but the hops balance the sweetness well. Hop driven fruit flavors are medium to medium high. The bitterness is medium high but is well balanced by the light malt sweetness. this moderately creamy beer has just under a medium body and has medium to medium high carbonation. This is a full flavored, easy to drink American IPA that is good enough to stock up on.

As soon as I open the bottle I could smell the cascade/centennial in it; tons of orange and grapefruit zest. Also, some pine resinous notes and tropical juicy fruits (can't really tell what fruit exactly) and sweetness from the malt. Very nice mouthfeel, medium body.   Overall, excellent beer!!! For some reason, I was expecting more of a traditional very piney west-coast IPA, but I was very surprised by the fruity notes in it. Very well balanced, loved it.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I was in the mood for a good West Coast IPA tonight, so I grabbed a 6-pack of Racer 5. A bottle date would be nice...     Pours a chill-hazed orange. A finger of dense, off-white foam leaves some lacing. Smell is a bit muted, but I get ruby red grapefruit, orange and pine. Bit of malt on the nose as it warms. Taste is much the same, with the malt playing a supporting role to the hops. Moderate amount of grapefruit pith and pine resin bitterness in the finish.     Feel is medium--very drinkable but with some heft. Overall an excellent, very enjoyable beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This was one of the first ipas I remember that started to get that orange appearance whether it be from the use of crystal malts or whatnot, but it took on that first edge of an orange glow with a 1/2" white head. Aroma is nice, leans grapefruit citrus wise, seems to have those C hops going in a good old school way.     What follows is a citrus that evolves from the usual old grapefruit to taking on a very small amount of tangerine. As they have expanded their distribution, you can get a little more variety out of these, some have seemed quite malty relative to the hop bomb some of them used to be. Some pine in there too, never one to skimp on bitterness in this beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Great IPA. I've been trying more IPA's lately and this one is definitely one of the best that I've had. Golden color, good carbonation, decent head that hangs around for a bit (but not too long). Great, hoppy flavor. Smooth finish with a slight aftertaste of citrus, among other things. I'd definitely get this again.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 This beer pours a fairly clear pale orange with an average head. The aroma leads with pine, supported by orange peel, grapefruit peel, underripe mango, and some caramel. The flavor leads with bright pine and resin, some dank notes, rounding into citrus peel, as well as vanilla and caramel. The mouthfeel is lighter than some West Coast style IPAs, and all the better for it. Overall I have finally found a West Coast IPA that truly works for me - not too sweet, lots of bitterness, great pine dominant hops with citrus accents and a few other notes. I can see why this is a classic.

Solid finger of white head that settles into a thin creamy layer.     Smell: A juicy and piney hop forward aroma with a scent of citrus fruit and pine. Upfront citrus hop scent of orange peel, grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, and lemon. Earthy hop hints of pine resin and grass. Malt hints of grains, cracker, and wheat with yeast. A pretty nice aroma.     Taste: Like it smells, a juicy and earthy hop forward taste with notes of citrus fruit and pine. Ripe citrus hop notes of grapefruit, orange peel, lemon, tangerine, and apricot. Earthy hop notes of pine resin and grass. Nicely bitter. Backing malt notes of cracker, grains, and wheat along with some yeast. A pretty good taste.     Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Juicy and fairly oily with a drying finish.     Overall: A very good West Coast IPA. Good ripe citrus and pine flavor.

It smells sweet malt, pine, grapefruit, floral hops, and perhaps a whiff of caramel. It has a solid malt base with lots of fruit, both grapefruit and sweet apricot or peach. It also has the bitter, hoppy finish you'd expect from a West Coast IPA. It definitely has a bite to it. This ale is medium-bodied, moderately carbonated, and the 7.5% ABV gives it substance without being overwhelming. Overall, it is a very good West Coast IPA. It's right up there with the leaders of the style.

Too many other IPAs waiting to be tried to get any more of my business.

T - Nicely balanced, not palate wrecking, but certainly big hop presence, the malt base is a touch sweet but mates well with the hop bite.  M - Big to start then gently walks off the set stage left, carbonation cleans up nicely.  O - A welcome treat, well balanced and big for the hop chasers.  Cheers

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3.5 Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass best before 3/29/16 not very fresh unfortunately. Pours a slightly cloudy orange with a one inch sticky head, that leaves behind some attractive lace.     Smell apricot, tangerine, caramel, pine, biscuit, and grapefruit, pretty damn tame. That is probably because of the 150 days old it probably is.    Taste follows apricot and orange up front with some caramel and biscuit, and pine and grapefruit in the finish.     Mouthfeel is medium plus, nice carbonation, not really dry, and good drinkability.     Overall this is not it should be, they should follow Stone and go with 90 days. I don't care that I know it is way past its prime, they should change the length of expiration.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bottle without a date. Equally parts hazy and carbonated, a golden-tinted beer with some sudsy lacing and a thin, retained head. Smell is pretty average at best, basic malt and hop profile, not that pungent. But this was stored at room temperature so I could see how it may have fallen off. Taste is a little more complex with several different hops highlighting what is a very refreshing, semi-dry finish. A little bitter component at the end, standard of many good IPA's. This is simply a good beer. Nothing too mindblowing, but definitely like it and would drink it anytime. Cheers.

So, Racer 5 gets a brief review.  First, I had it in their brewpub in Healdsburg several years ago and that experience was good.  Second, this was on one of my lists.    I now note when a beer is listed in one of my three books comprising my classical beer education.  "1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die", page 471.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Smell is mild and flavorful. At 7.5%, it's pretty strong, but you can't tell. Goes down smoothly. Very pleasant and mild. If I hadn't had Stone's Enjoy By DIPA last night, I probably would have rated this higher. A solid IPA. Now that I am in California, this will be my go-to 6 pack.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Clear golden pour with a touch of amber. Outstanding head volume and retention, world class lacing.    Outstanding nose of citrus hops, rind and pine with a subtle dank tickle underneath.    Almost medium body with a smooth texture that has an oily component. World class carbonation with a bursting effervescent middle and a finely bubbled prickly finish.    The flavor profile is quite outstanding and is masterfully balanced. It begins with a blended hop flavor (heavy on the pine and rind) that slowly tails off into a subtle dank element. Orange arrives along with the subtle dank notes as the middle approaches over a succulent balancing sweetness of bready biscuit and light caramel. Bitterness is moderate and perfectly balanced. The finish delivers a very slight alcohol note and associated astringency. A slow fade of sweet orange rind lingers.

I saw some people calling it out as better than RRs Blind Pig so i tried them side by side and Blind Pig blew it out of the water in every way. The nose on this thing is underwhelming and a little strange. i couldnt put my finger on what it was. the appearance was cloudy and the taste was pretty middle of the road as far as i am concerned. definitely not a bad beer but nothing special or anywhere near Blind Pig or Union Jack   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Racer 5 India Pale Ale - Bear Republic Brewing Co. is a decent tasting IPA. Nice hit of citrus/grapefruit as soon as the bottle was cracked open. Great golden amber to orange color on the pour. It has a nice medium-bodied feel ! Citrusy up front, piney on the backend with just enough bitterness. The flavor stays with you after it finds its way down . Clocking in at a 7.5% ABV, this one could catch up to you with the quickness. I do like this but I will chose a Bells Two Hearted over this one , but that's just me.

The appearance was a bronzed golden amber to orange color with a light transparency allowing a fine carbonation to be seen rising at a moderate pace. One finger white foamy head displaces and is replaced by some messy stringy lacing.  The smell had a wonderful burst of bitter piney/resinous hops to citrusy hops. An evenly settled caramel malt is pretty far in the background of this beer.  The taste was purely bittersweet all throughout the entire consumption. Never lost a step in the movement of this down my throat.  The mouthfeel was about a light to medium in body with a fantastic sessionability. Carbonation feels good for an AIPA and for me as enough hops burst on the scene to lead the charge for who's to claim the harshness on my tongue - hops win - which is good!  Overall, AIPA fans in the distro of this, you'd better "race" out there to get this when its fresh. Why? Because you don't have to stand in line just to try it.

Nonetheless it had a light but persistent head. The taste was amazing. Very smooth and thought the hops were evident, they were also subtle... satisfying to perhaps all but those who must have the hops forward Double and Imperial IPAs. This would make a great session IPA if not for the moderately high ABV.

My liquor stocked the 22oz. and I requested the 6 pack glass bottles which is $11.29 out the door. The 22s are $5.40 so obviously the 6 pack is a better deal. This beer has it all. It has those amazing citrus notes as well as a deliciously bitter taste. Not for those who don't like a strong beer as 2 12oz. bottles will leave you buzzed if you down it fast enough. Whenever this is not in stock (which pisses me off) I reach for a Ruination as it's the only other beer that satisfies my IPA craving. Super reluctant to grab anything else (and feel like I am cheating on Racer) and you better believe my glass recycling is all racer bottles!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Solid. The only word that I can think of to describe this classic IPA is solid. It's solidly in the middle of the IPA paradigm. The execution is solid. It's one of the most famous west coast IPAs for very good reason.    The look is very promising. This India pale ale pours a golden orange color, moderately hazy. The head is a delicious foamy eggshell color that foams up elaborately, retains, and laces. They've spared no expense on the malt, the head makes clear. All kinds of good stuff seems to be in store.    The aroma is a strong point of Racer 5. They've nailed it. It achieves the tropical grapefruit aroma that I'm looking for. I know tropical grapefruit is not a thing, but in the best IPAs they achieve it anyway. The aroma is perfectly modulated - neither overbearing nor weak. It stays righteous until the bottom of the glass, never fading or getting catty. Barely detectable, just behind the citrus scent of the hops, the malt conveys a pleasant biscuit aroma.    The taste of Racer 5 is solid. It's a mainstream west coast IPA flavor, initially strongly citrus from the hops but backed up proportionately with a subtle yet very appealing biscuit flavor. The description biscuit is overused in my experience, but this is truly it. I've never really enjoyed a biscuit-like malt except with Racer 5. As you might expect, since both are from the California wine country, Lagunitas and Racer 5 have a similar aesthetic, sharing their beautiful citrus hops bouquet and the effort to balance the hops with a significant malt. Racer 5 out runs their wine country competition in the Stone-like appealing dankness of their IPA and the flavorful biscuit malt that backs the hops up. Like Lagunitas, Racer 5 is a very easy drinking, pleasant and enjoyable IPA. The fabled bitterness of IPAs is no doubt present, but it's in sync with the expectations from the flavors and so is purely enjoyable.    The feel of Racer 5 is fine. It's not watery, but medium-bodied. It does not come across as thin-feeling like Rebel can, but doesn't quite have as much body as I seem to feel with Lagunitas.    Overall, Racer 5 is a fabled west coast IPA for good reason. It's extremely good. Like Stone, it costs a few dollars more for a 12-pack than some other appealing and widely available options, but it's worth it. Maybe it's not worth springing for one of the true paragons every trip, but every now and then . . .

Amazing from first sip to finish. Deep gold with clear, subtle carbonation. Piney citrus hops presence in the nose and a rich malt backbone. The flavors mixed and mingled on the tongue in a way that I couldn't wait for the next sip to see how it would taste. Excellent IPA. Definitely recommending this and drinking it again.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Somewhere in between the last spring sample and the newest autumn sampler rush at the beer store, this beer became my go to. Its a pale ale more in the style of Sierra nevada pale ale as opposed to the torpedo...Get it? Its a like India Pale ale that is the absolute BEST BEER THAT YOUR MONEY CAN BUY. It clocks in at 7.5 and is usually less than 5 bucks. Its good. Its so good that I usually buy one with whatever else I am buying at the time, Like today. I bought sixers of ace pineapple, and Michelob Amberbock, as well as the new DOGFISH PUNK...I got a 22 of Racer 5. Its perfect for that, get beer, start or enjoy a racer 5 somewhere early or middle. Its good/great and cheap. Ballast Point is worth every fucking penny, but sometimes it hurts to spend 50 bucks on 5 22 ounce beers, or 14 god damned dollars a 6 pack, of  [email protected]  six pack....Next time you want to do that...Get a couple of 22's of racer 5. Thank me later.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This was poured into a pint glass.  The appearance was a hazy orange golden color with a one finger off white head that hangs around for a little bit before gently dieing. Lacing was kinda messy.  The smell had a really nice blend of tropical and citrus fruits with a really light sweet malt in the background.  The taste follows the smell very nicely and leads into the aftertaste and finds it's way into the finish.  The mouthfeel was about a light to medium on the body with a decent drinkable feel to it. Bitterness does hit nicely as an AIPA.  Overall, really nice AIPA, super glad to try, I'd definitely have again.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Best By 12/01/15    Appearance: hazy orange golden color with a two finger creamy off white head that sticks around. Plenty of lacing. One of the better looking IPAs my eyes have laid on     Smell: A wonderful bouquet of tropical and citrus fruits and pine with a subtle sweet malt undertone    Taste: Tropical fruits upfront, pine midpalate, finishes piney and citrusy. I get more malt in the taste than the smell    Mouthfeel: Medium bodied; Super smooth and creamy with a dry bitter finish    Overall: I could see this being a top tier IPA back in the day, and i probably would have rated it higher even five years ago. There are newer IPAs with a better hop profile, but this is one of the better oldschool ones. The look and mouthfeel alone are worth picking this up.   Cheers!

A very well done IPA. It's just not the tropical juice bomb that I personally love.

Nice clean taste on the first sip. Some sweetness, but nothing overbearing, and a nice clean resiny pine taste. Goes down very smooth. This tastes more east coast style than west coast to me. Maybe just the style of hops, not overly malty though which is a plus.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Look: Poured from a bottle into a goblet. It was a cloudy medium amber, with a giant, fluffy white head that slowly melted into a snowy hillock. I throughly cleaned and dried another glass and poured a second to test the clarity. Still cloudy.     Smell: A masterfully balanced C-hop tree from top to bottom: earth, grass, wood, and citrus. Some tropical fruit scents and a piercing smell of white pepper make for a captivating garnish.     Taste: One of those nice, round balls of complexity that fascinates as a collaboration rather than a conglomeration. Toasted, buttery malt is topped with grapefruit, mint leaves, and rosemary. A small dose of peach juice and a squeeze of caramel add just enough sweetness to keep the medium-high bitterness from being overwhelming. It's so well done, but it still begs for a little something more to set it apart from other IPAs of good caliber.     Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy, yet still smooth. Light alcohol warming and medium-high carbonation continue the theme of balance by creating an atmosphere that's both refreshing and intoxicating.     Overall: This IPA is undeniably good, but it's perhaps so well-balanced, that it becomes a little boring when compared to the wide varieties of recipes on the market today. Still, it's a sure bet, and one I will therefore continue to buy.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Excellent pour, great color and nice thick foamy head. Great taste and very smooth going down. Unique aftertaste still can't pinpoint exactly what the taste is. Leaves you smacking for another sip, which I don't mind taking.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Virtually all the elements of this beer speak to quality--look, lacing, feel and finish. But the taste is a little too plain. 
look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Pours a hazy, pale golden yellow. Fairly frothy and large off white cap that has excllent rentention.     Aromas are basically non existent. Faint pale malts and citrus. Doesnt smell bad or good. Somehow, just nothing there.     Tastes good, but nothing crazy either way. I read Chinook hops. I get that. Mainly just in the form of being bitter at the end. Othherwise, just a lot of muted flavor malt, pine, citrus.     Body is nice. Full and slightly creamy.     I am not sure of the age of this beer, but it was in a cooler. I say this because it is nowhere close to the ratings for me. I know I am in the minority. It just doesnt offer me anything other than not being offensive in any way. I would score this better as a pale ale truthfully.

You see I really would like to like them...they're just so available. Purchased a fresh 12 oz bottle of Racer 5 last night from a local deli. I can tell this is good beer, but it's still not my type. I could see having 1 or 2 of these now and then if I'm not pairing them with food but, after 1 or 2, I would need to switch to something else. And I can't see drinking it with food as I think the beer would overpower whatever I was eating.

Citrus, pine, tropical fruits, a little sweet malt.This one has it all... One of the more diverse smelling beers that I have had. There is a lot going on here.     Taste isn't exactly as it smells, I didn't get much citrus or tropical fruits....   What I did get was a nice hop malt mix, Somewhat hop forward, slightly bitter. Very enjoyable.    Interesting... Average full feel. not overly carbonated, but a non aggressive pour still produced a huge head (?)    This beer is like an onion... lots of different layers . And they are all pretty good... pleasantly complex. Hard to describe (in a good way)

Taste is clean with only a little bitterness. Tiny citrus. Mostly a mixture of hops. Not wet hops either. Abv is 7.5% so this could be dangerous on a hot day. Easy drinking. Excellent ipa.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Nice citrus and grapefruit smells with the same on the taste with a piney lingering bitterness. The best part that really ties everything together is the body and almost drinks like a double ipa. Very nice sweet malts but still very bitter and a strong IPA. At only 7.99 in socal its a definite go to.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Poured into a standard, straight sided pint glass.    A - 4.75 - Pours a nice, golden-orange juice color. Forms a good, solid finger of bright white ivory head. Medium head potential, strong head retention. Nice, thick solid rings of lacing left behind on the walls of the glass.  S - 4.5 - Pine, grapefruit rind, hops, earthiness, bitterness and a rain water freshness.   T - 4.75 - Lightly sweet grapefruit rind upfront which develops into a bitter, hoppy and piney finish. Definitely a bitter biased, west-coast IPA.  F - 5 - Nice oily, creamy quality to the body of this brew. Goes down quite smoothly.  O - 5 - Drinks easy like a session beer but packs a punch with the ABV. Refreshes and quenches your thirst like water, making this both a good standalone sipping beer or a great food pairing beer as well. Racer 5 is an unquestionably awesome representation of the standard american west-coast IPA style, and I HIGHLY recommend it to fans of the more bitter and not so sweet IPAs, you will not regret the purchase!

I had a 5 gallon keg of this last fall and it was good. This keg is exceptional. Bear republic is creating some amazing beers that may rival or beat their neighbors to the south Russian River.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a cloudy gold color with a respectable white head. The aroma was mainly floral and piny with a tad bit citrus hops, but was pretty faint for a west coast styled IPA. The hop flavor was very reflective of the aroma, with a little malt sweetness on the back end. Overall it was a pretty tasty IPA and if it wasn't so pricy compared to other brews I would probably get it all the time.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Fresh 12oz bottle into a solo cup.    A: Hazy copper with about 1/2" of whitish head that recedes kinda quick. Retention actually isn't that bad, nice lacing here.    S: Some grapefruit, mostly resinous pine. (disclosure: I'm struggling with a cold so my olfactory senses suck at the moment)    T: Brilliant! Perfect balance between oily hop bitter & beefy off-sweet malt. Everything here is big, yet in absolute equilibrium. Some piney aspects lead into a grapefruity note toward the finish right before the malt hits...just awesome.    M: Burly. Dense malt with a bit of soapiness balanced against just the right amount of carb.    O: What can I say here? It's a classic & deservedly so.

I get a hint of - could that be caramel? Texture is good and firm, with plenty of fizz.

Tastes of pine, citrus, orange peel, butter. The malt makes a caramel biscuit backbone.     Medium mouth feel with an oily slickness as it goes down. The hops contribute to a sharp bite on the back end.    I would prefer less sweetness from the malt so that the hop profile could shine through. With that in mind, overall this is s good IPA.

Smell is faint, but very nice...featuring tropical fruits, grapefruit, and pine. Taste is of citrus and tropical fruits, leaving a very pleasant hoppy after taste. Mouth feel is lightly carbonated and extremely smooth. Overall an outstanding IPA.

It doesn't jump out of the glass like some other IPAs do. I actually think the taste was better than the smell. It has a very tropical fruity aftertaste, with some subtle grapefruit and pine. Not very bitter and I enjoy this beer more and more as it warms up. I will definitely buy it again, as a bomber was only $4.99 here.
