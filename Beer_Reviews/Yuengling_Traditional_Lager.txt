The favor was lighter than I expected and the hops were equally light. Overall the taste and drinking experience was comparable to Heineken. Not bad, but I hoped for better. I want to try the new Yuengling Pils.

Consistent flavor from first bottle to last. Speaking of bottles, doesn’t beer taste a little better when poured from green glass(except for Mickey’s). Enjoy!

The aroma is mostly of toasty, buiscuity malt and slight caramel. A bit of spiciness, perhaps from noble hops, cuts through.     The flavor follows similarly with toasty malt and some caramel. There is just a hint of malt sweetness that is well balanced by hop bitterness.    It has depth of malt flavor without being sweet. It remains crisp and drinkable.     Carbonation is moderate, body is medium-light.    Pretty solid beer overall: crisp, tasty, and drinkable at a great price.

A slight amount of hops detected but it's certainly not bitter. It's very good for a red lager. Carbonation medium-high and body medium-low. It's highly drinkable and quite refreshing.    Overall, i really like this beer. Certainly better than most other lagers you find at the grocery store. It was better when i had it out of a keg but that is to be expected...Grade is a B+

Aroma is toast, grain & caramel malt, fruity with hints of nuts, grass and earth. Taste is caramel, lightly toasted bready malt, corn, pepper, grass and earthy hops. A little bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation; silky up front it finishes with a prickly bite.

One extra star just for the sake of respect and staying independent all of these years.    Yes, it is not your first choice, however, when you are stuck in an airport or in a bar with very little lighting in Pennsylvania or any of the mid Atlantic cities and towns, I say, "Good to see You my old friend."

The microbrew/import snobs may not agree (I'm not interested in your avocado beer!), but if you typically drink a straightforward American lager, this should be at the top of the list. Unfortunately, their distribution footprint is quite limited. But it is very good for a mass-produced American brew.

It's bright copper body glows when backlit and the clarity is near perfection. Each individual bubble can be seen shooting to the surface if you pay attention. The dirty white foam is silky and a finger high when poured. It settles, eventually, to a skimming with some puffy little islands here and there.    This beer shows some quality. The nose is grainy off the bat, creeping towards, and eventually catching up to toasty. So the main notes are that toasted graininess and a soft, surrounding earthiness. Softly spicy, complimentary hops bring up the rear. This is fairly one dimensional but what's there is enjoyable.    Unfortunately, the flavor doesn't quite live up to the nose. The same aspects are there for the most part but they're a bit watered down. White bread crust and a soft caramel sweetness get things moving and actually push through to the finish. They're met with a whisper of green apple and cereal grain sweetness. A mix of spicy and floral hoppiness wraps it all up neatly.    Traditional Lager is a medium bodied beer with a rather aggressive carbonation that fits well. Those bubbles get this beer moving at a good clip and leave an impression on the tongue. The finish is fairly dry which manages to boost the drinkability even higher.    This is a fine beer in its respective category. It's interesting enough to keep you coming and good enough to plow through many. A well made beverage on a large scale with a bit more character than a lot of the others in the same category.

look: 4 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 4 This is not a great beer, but for value for money its way up there. When I see this on tap I always have a pint or two. You know most beers on tap that are meant to be a pint are served in 16oz glasses and so many times when the head settles lucky to get 13 0r 14 ozs so where I am 2.5 to 3 dollars not such a big deal. When you pay 5 to 7 dollars for a micro brew now there's another story. Also keep a few at home for when I know its the last of the night. Why any one would buy Bud or Coors or any other cheap beer over this I have no idea its way above them.

Malty sweet up front with a hint of hoppage on the back end and it's very consistent. One thing I will note to those who aren't familiar with this classic - BUY IT IN CANS. For some reason the bottle ruins this beer. I can't stress that enough. If you buy it in bottles, you are guaranteed to think it tastes awful. If you're standing in the beer section right now looking this beer up (which I've done many times over the years with countless different brews) go ahead and give it try - just make sure to BUY CANS!

It will always have a special place in my heart and everyone should try it but my rating is fair.

Looks nice and clear with a light amber color, leaves a thin lacing that stays on the glass. So far, so good!    Has a very lightly sweet smell with some complexity to it. Maybe a little spicy and slightly earthy? Can't really describe it, except smells very nice.    The taste combines a light sweetness from the malt with a roasted malt/earthy flavor. The hops add a lightly spicy flavor with very little bitterness. Has a clean finish.    Has a medium/light mouthfeel. Not thin, but also not heavy at all. Easy to drink. Very user friendly.    Overall, this a nice easy drinking beer that goes extremely well with food. It is similar to a Vienna Lager or maybe an Amber Lager in style.

Bit of a breaddy smell.    Clean and refreshing taste, slightly sweet but not too much going on here.     Very easy drinking and sessionable. Goes down very smooth, no aftertaste.     It’s a quality lager. It’s in a middle ground where it’s not necessarily fair to put against micro crafts, but it’s not a typical watered down macro either. For the price, it’s worthwhile for the craft drinker that wants to have a good fridge stocker for parties and guests. Good overall lager.

look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Clear dark amber color. Bready smelll. Little head and little lacing. Mouthfeel was thin and slightly creamy with moderate carbonation. Has a toasty, nutty, semi sweet caramel taste with a hint of lemon zest. Moderate hops, more than your typical macro brew, but less than most craft brews. This is a decent beer. Not as good as a Sam Adams. About on par with a Shiner Bock. Maybe not quite as nutty and sweet as a Shiner. You could do a lot worse. Give this one a try if you haven't already.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Look - poured from a 12 oz can. Amber red in color with lots of carbonation. Carbonated head that dissipates quickly into a hint of lacing.  Smell - toasted malts and light hops. no fragrance that stands out to be amazing, and no smell that makes it putrid. Right on the average.  Taste - malt forward, hint of sweetness, and crisp and refreshing finish. the taste really distinguishes it from an adjunct, putting it in line with craft brews.  Feel - light bodied, heavy carbonation, and light on ABV at 4.5%  Overall - one of the best lagers money can buy at this price. Yuengling separates itself from the adjunct lagers with its great taste and lack of off-putting odors. An easy go-to beer at any time.

Lacing ring remains after each large swig. Hops and malt balance each other into a mild lager taste. neither bitter nor sweet. Tastes like a nice beer should, and is easy to put a bunch of these away at a time.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 A solid, longtime PA staple lager. When compared to most of the adjunct lagers people drink, you can pick it out of the lineup. Pours with a moderate head, dissipates quickly, and for a lager, very easy to drink. Best paired (in my opinion) with any kind of fish. Readily available and easy on the wallet, I keep going back to this beer when I don’t want to test the waters with micro-brews. Been a Yueng fan for years and will continue to be!

I guess I expected more from hearing all the hype. $5.99 for a sixer of pints is a super deal. Poured into a clear plastic hotel cup. Beautiful amber color, not much smell, way lighter taste than I anticipated. You would never imagine this was an amber beer from the taste. It almost tastes like a light beer. It is flavorful but nothing extraordinary. I taste some adjunct like corn syrup as well. It’s good but not as good as I was led to believe. Great for the price and if it becomes available in the Houston area I’ll get it again.

The beer pours bright light amber with short lived off white head. The aroma is minimal and really is just a hint of yeast and malt. The taste is pretty standard AAL with a little tart edge. The caramel in the color does not translate to taste. Mouthfeel is thin bodied, adequately carbonated and undry. The oily/soapy finish is a little off putting. Overall, ok. This appears to be an AAL with added color. Might have been a better beer with more lager time and less color.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Yuengling is historically superior compared with the big 3. Yuengling is the definition of American beer, they where the first, they remain small and they have never backed out of the game. That's American.   All things considered, this is a very tasty beer. Beautiful rich amber red color and a lovely yeast smell. You get a lot of cracker tasting notes, and some bitterness at the middle and end of the swallow. The feel is thin and very much like a light Beer. Occasionally I get a slight pear like taste which doesn't happen often. This is about as close as you can get to a European lager but still remain American taste profile.This beer has a very nice Hop spice that many american beers don't have. You can think of this beer as being a hybrid between a helles and pilsner. I get a faint maltiness that is much weaker than the helles style, yet its present. Has slightly more robustness than miller high life, rich flavor but not up to par with European All-Malt Lagers. For what it is, Yuengling is a very good beer and a makes a good detour if you want something with more flavor than Highlife or Pabst. This beer makes a good introductory into the world of euro-style with american lightness. I think there is far greater beers out there, however if you want a good rotational beer for any day of the week, this one is the go to.

The go to beer when you are relaxing on the beach in Florida, just "drinking" and not really putting any thought into it.    Clear amber color.  Smells like beer/bread, but not super strong.  Not much taste, but that also makes it inoffensive and lets you just focus on whatever else you are doing.

Has thin head and lacing, dissipates gradually. Mild carbonation.    Smells like bread, grains, toasted oats and cereal malts, along a note of honey. Altogether not too strong.    Tastes a lot like the smell: bread, grains, toasted oats and cereal malts. There's corn in the flavor, along with earthy flavors. It tastes like any pale lager I suppose, but there's something more to it. There's a citrusy, sort of sweet complement to the flavor, along with the honey.    Feels somewhat smooth.    Overall, it's like any pale lager but there is a nice added sweetness that is with it.

look: 3 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.25 This was the first beer I ever tried, as I'm sure many others did: sipped from my grandfather's bottle. I thought it tasted pretty terrible at the time, but now I know what truly awful beers taste like. This ain't one of 'em. On tap at The Lounge in Bartonsville.     L: Deep amber in color. Tiny head leaves a tiny bit of lacing that clings all the way down the glass. If there were a perfect example of the way an AAL should look, this is it.    S: Bread, grains, a light floral hop characteristic. Unfortunately there's a strong corn smell that washes everything else out.    T: Very much like the smell, the bread is more pronounced and blends well with the malt. Not too exciting, but certainly not bad and a damn sight better than the average example of the style (which admittedly isn't saying much).    F: Velvety and crisp. The lacing leaves a creamy froth on top that feels very nice on your tongue. Somewhat heavy, but totally worth it. As close to luxurious as you can get with this price tag attached.    Ever since I discovered the light version, this is no longer one of my "go-to's". That said, if you tell me this is your favorite beer, I will at least nod in acknowledgement instead of asking why.

Nice white head that fades quickly and leaves just a little bit of lacing.    S---Malts are up front, with some light hops in the background. Nothing fancy, just a good beer smell.    T---Very nice balance between malts & hops. More balanced than you might expect. Cereal grains from the malts and some citrus from the hops. Much more flavorful than its competition (things like Bud, Miller, etc...)    F---Light & crisp. Goes down smoothly.    O---I'm from Eastern Pennsylvania, so Lager has been omnipresent in my beer life. It's always on tap and priced as a "domestic", which means it's the same price as Budweiser or Coors Light. And that's why I never drink those. Lager is actually good, and they are not. It deserves the name "Lager".

Although the look and foam resembles a lager, the taste is more of a beer diluted with seltzer water. There's some arguable 'crispness' I suppose, but always disappointed when I give it another try every few years. Yuengling may be steeped in tradition and look okay from across the room, but would sooner opt for an island ale or budget Mexican brew because the label better describes the content.

Flavorful, pretty easy drinking, while this is not my favorite from the brewer, I enjoy every beer that Yuengling makes.

This gives a 2 finger head.  The color is a beautiful copper amber.  The aroma is a nice malt with a touch of hops.  The taste is malty up front with a slight citrus/pine toward the back of the palate.  Nice blended, rich bodied malt/hops mid palate with a finish of malt, citrus hops.  This is a nice Lager, far better than Bud, Bud Light or Busch, but not quite as crisp and refreshing as Sierra Nevada.

I was a beer guy prior to living there, but was ignorant on what made a truly great beer! A neighbor handed me one of these (actually 3) and I was amazed at how it reminded me of beers that I had drank in Germany! A true lager, which is what I tend to look for! And this beer for the price is truly exceptional for my taste. Sadly it is a regional beer only available in a few states! But some of those states border Kentucky! ROAD TRIP!

look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 This really is a Budweiser killer. A real German lager, not heavy or remarkable, but without the watery, low malt seltzer appeal of Bud in a can. Very consistent, even though I haven't lived in PA for 25+ years, every year have a couple of cases brought back when family visits. Solid cookout beer, good to server your close friends.    L: A bit darker and more beery than the big red, white and blue beer. Decent head on pour, moderate bubble size, attractive without exceptional quality.    S: Like most, a bit skunky by the time I get it, but not bad, and after a minute or two good beer smells, bit of hops, bit of malt. Lets you know you are drinking beer.    T: Solid day drinker. Nothing you sit around a discuss with friends, but not drain pour. No exceptional pairing, goes pretty well with pizza or burgers.    F: Thin as expected. A quick drinking beer, not one to force you to ponder it.    O: Again, you gotta give some thing a bit more than the average of their parts. the experience of the beer, and the consistency and the history of the brewery, rate a 4 in my book.

The head recedes to a thin ring leaving spotty lacing behind.  S- The nose is restrained, but made up primarily of malt sweetness.  T- Similar to the nose. Primarily a lightly sweet caramel presence. Hops restrain the sweetness to a point, but are ultimately overwhelmed. A bit of metallic undertone from the can detracts slightly.  F- Mouthfeel is light bordering on watery. Carbonation is moderate a prickly. A beer designed to be consumed in multiples.  O- A better beer on draft than from the can. As large mass produced lagers go this one is high up on my list with SA Boston Lager. A good choice where craft options are limited.

A: Pours a clear, copper color with a one inch, off white head with good retention and modest lacing.   S: Very little nose. A little swampy, truthfully. Shouldn't be served in a green bottle.   T: Very limited caramel flavor with equally limited, albeit offsetting bitterness.   M: Light to medium bodied. Low to medium carbonation.   O: This is a drinkable, if not exceptional dark lager.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 This is not a beer I keep in the house, so my only experience is mooching off some friends at ball games or in college. I'm not a lager fan to begin with, let alone a fan of mass-produced lagers, but this one is actually pretty okay.     Look: Pours clear amber with white head that quickly dissipates to minimal lacing. Drinking straight from the bottle produces the same effect after the first pull.    Smell: Not much nose at all, typical of mass-produced lagers. Grassy with the tiniest trace of malt at the end.     Taste: This is where Yuengling actually acquits itself in comparison to, say, (American) Budweiser or Miller. Relatively full-flavored for a lager with notes of light citrus, grass, green wood, and light malt. All crisp on the palate with a dry finish and no lingering aftertaste.     Again, not anything I would buy for myself but if you're in need of a cold beer at a ball game, or just a chugger for a party, you can certainly do worse for yourself.

It's a pretty gorgeous looking lager, a brilliant garnet amber. That's pretty much what I can say. There's a bit of caramel malts, grain, some grassy notes. But there's no much there, there. A tick is a tick, I guess. The Mud Hens beat the Durham Bulls, so that was nice.

It is incredibly drinkable. But not for the micro brew crowd. Drink it from a glass for the real experience. Pours a dark amber with a one finger white head. First taste is strong malt and very sweet. Nice hop balance through the finish. Worth every dime.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 Copper colored beer with a white head that fades quickly and leaves only a stray speck and glob of lacing behind. The aroma smells like apple juice and tobacco with some malty sweetness. The taste is a little malty with grain and hint of apple cider vinegar. There is a sweet, acidic and mildly bitter aftertaste. There is decent carbonation but a light mouthfeel. It is okay but I wouldn't really seek this out.

look: 4.25 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 5 The myth, the legend, the beer. Yuengling is, in my opinion, probably the greatest American beer ever made.     From the bottle and from the can, the aroma can be a bit harsh. Somewhat skunky (thanks green bottle), crackery and with a metallic tinge from the can. However, thankfully, the taste doesn't quite follow the nose. When drank straight from the bottle, it's more crackery and ever so slightly skunky at times, but the malts and hops still come through a bit. From the can, it gets a bit better, still slightly harsh, but the skunkyness is subdued, and the malts and hops shine through better.     This beer really shines when poured into a glass, however, as I suppose you would expect.   If poured well, the beer leaves a really nice fluffy and effervescent head that actually has really, really good retention. Lacing is decent, more so than most any other beers in this price range. Impressive, really. As far as color goes, it looks good enough for me; a beautiful amber-red hue, decently clear but not completely transparent. It looks beautiful in my old Falstaff glass.     The aroma when poured into a glass is very much subdued, but perhaps for the better. It smells somewhat caramel-like, slightly malty.    When taking a sip, the mouthfeel is perfect for me. Perhaps a bit watery for some, but hey, it's a lager. To me the upside is that it feels very creamy when paired with the flavor.    Speaking of which, the flavor follows the nose but brings more. Caramel-like malts bring a slight toasty character with them, which works rather well, as well as a bit of a crackery note, maybe a slight Munich malt kind of flavor. Overall very German tasting. A slight dank Germanic hop note takes a very subtle back seat, but that's a good place for it. As the beer warms a bit however, it really starts to impress me. A very bready malt aftertaste takes over, very caramelly, and suddenly this starts to taste like a watered down Oktoberfest. I really can't complain about that.     Overall, for me, this is THE go-to perfect session beer. If this was sold in my state, I would buy a case of it every time I go beer shopping. However, since it isn't, every time I'm in the distribution area, I buy a case or several to take home with me. I'm proud to say my family and friends are all Yuengling lovers and we have several cases in our basements to enjoy. Ein Prosit to America's greatest beer.

While it doesn't wow me like it once did, it is still my go to American lager when I want something light and easy drinking. Compared to most American macro lagers, this one has some actual flavor. Notes of caramel and a very slight roastiness are present along with some corn adjunct. It's a very clean beer with no off flavors, but nothing that will blow you away either. Just an easy drinking American lager.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.75 Pours a dark copper color with a lace of head. Smell has some adjunct aromas, but kinda malty. Not much flavor, no bitterness, a little dry. Overall a bland Amber Lager.

I really enjoy this beer it is my favorite cheap beer, other mass produced American beers really don't live up to Yuengling considering there about the same price.

Feel - Light body, well carbonated, slightly dry.    Overall - Below average.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3 Looks good - caramel. Smell is nice not off putting but a little non descript. Taste is somewhat macro lager with some caramel malt added. Ok.

The first beer that isn't completely watered down, and that you can have with food (my college circle called this our "sandwich and beer" beer).    Its not a world champion mountain mover but it is very very good for what it is. In the realm of mass produced lager, its a 5 but ratings need to be consistent.    If you're down on cash and want a good tasting brew, yeung-dawgs are where its at.

Fluffy off white head that stands 1 finger tall with low retention and sticky lacing.Amber / copper colored body with very good clarity.Heavy amount of carbonation.    On the nose I get mostly caramel malts,and earthy pine hops.Really not much else to speak of.Maybe a little bit of metallic notes.    The palate follows the nose with caramel malts up front,and some pine and citrus hops on the back end balanced by sweet malts.    The mouth feel is thin and watery,but not watered down.There is a good amount of oxidation on the tongue from the carbonation.Smooth easy finish.    My father loves this one,it really isn't bad for being a mass produced beer.A good alternative if you can't afford the expensive craft beers,or they aren't available.Not bad but nit earth shattering either...Solid Lager.

An amber beer maltiness without tons of flavor, lightly spicy bitterness is refreshing for a staple beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 One of the oldest continuously brewed beers in America. This beer has been brewed since 1829 for a reason. It pours a lovely clear amber color with a small head has a wonderful smell and taste. I live west of the Mississippi so I have to have someone going east to get this for me and I NEVER miss the chance. One of the best beers in America.   
look: 2.75 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Doesn't quite pour the deepest shade of amber, and I could have sworn it used to be darker, but it has been a while. It's more of a brownish gold, almost like that murky pond water or something. Other than that, it pours with a nice frothy head like you'd expect from a lager, with excellent retention. The aroma is dominated by a caramel sweetness, and the smell of bread dough, with hints of corn and maybe some biscuity notes. The taste follows the nose, but there's actually a lot more flavor than I anticipated. Relatively huge sweetness, bready goodness, and a subtle hit of hop flavor just to let you know it's there. The body is perfect for the style, crisp smooth, and refreshing. Overall, this is my favorite AAL. It may not punch you in the taste buds with flavor like a double IPA, but that's not the point. This is a lager, and for what it is, it's one of the best out there.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Love this beer. This is my go to beer any day of the week. Easy to drink and is served mostly anywhere on the east coast. 
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Yuengling Traditional Lager. I am finally rating this beer, but in reality I've been drinking it for several years (5) as I have lived on the east coast since I was 18. This beer has been drank by me at barracks parties, mid-range and low range restaurants and bars, house parties, grilling and smoking, get-togethers, holidays, ball games, and everything in between. It fits in everywhere like a Budweiser would, so onto the rating:   Look: poured from a bottle into a   Pint glass. It pours a medium copper-amber color with a foamy white head, which can be about a finger tall if poured at a 45° angle, then slowly leveled out. Head renention is longer than a Miller, Bud or Coors (light or regular). Usually at a restauraunt or bar the glass comes back with a thin film of bubbles left from the head. Still, a good looking beer, can, bottle or draft. Leaves some lacing on the glass. This beer looks like a lager.   Smell: smells sweet. A hint of hop and sweet malts, but not overpowering. Tiny hint of floral type smell. Again, mostly smells like a standard lager beer (not like the big 3).   Taste: this is where it gets a little funny. On draft, this beer is wonderful, absolutely great. In a bottle, most of the time almost as good as draft, but sometimes (if you get an older pack/case), it can be a little skunked, but not like a Stella or a Heineken (which are not even in the same class as this beer), though I have not had a skunked case or pack of Yuenglings in the past year or 2. In a can (mini-mini-keg), it is always the same, a pretty good brew. So, up front there is a bit of hop bitterness, but not overpowering at all like a Boston Lager by Sam Adams. The hop is IMMEDIATELY followed by a fairly strong sweet malt. It finishes with a slight malt aftertaste. Sometimes it tastes a little like a bit of tea and beer mixed together, not in a bad way though.   Feel: medium carbonation, feels let watery than most "lager beers(i.e., Bud and Coors)." The mouthfeel feels exactly the way you'd expect a lager to feel. Light-medium bodies with medium carbonation. It's a solid beer.   Overall. This beer is my go-to beer when I'm in the states on the east coast. A ton of restauraunts consider this beer to be domestic, which is awesome because I can think of 5 places that sell it for $1 at happy hour or buy one get one free at happy hour. Almost every resauraunt I've had a beer at sell this for $2.50-$3.50, where Budweiser or Miller or Coors would be $2.50-3.50. Only a few places up-sell this beer over the big 3, which is awesome as it's quality is far superior. 80% of the time I order a beer here in Florida, it's a Yuengling because I love lagers, good beer and inexpensive beers. You can get this beer for $9 a pitcher... Not bad. This beer has a good, standard lager taste (in a good way), a good look, a pleasant smell and a whole lotta drinkability. If I could only have 10-12 beers in my life, this one stays because it is a great example of and American Lager.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Yuengling, from America's oldest brewery, is a very solid beer. A fairly simple lager, its flavor is well balanced but with a malty finish. On tap, this is one of the smoothest and most refreshing beers I've had. Doesn't seem to do quite as well from a bottle, and a little better out of the can than bottle in my experience, but overall a great year-round session beer to keep it simple. Technically a big craft brewery, Yuengling's flagship brew stands up swimmingly against the big names.    Fun fact: Yuengling was forced to go into the ice cream business during prohibition, and they still make that too, though I don't know that it pairs well with the beer!   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Got two 24 oz cans as part of a deal for 4$. The look is a dark brown/amber color which is pretty satisfying to look at. Not a strong smell but I like it so its a 3.5. The taste is pretty solid for a cheap beer that is mass produced, really can not complain given what your paying. Feels pretty smooth for a lager, doesn't seems as filling as say a Sam Adams Boston Lager. Can drink these babies all night. Solid beer for the price.

Taste is smooth, with hops, grass, and corn the strongest, and from start to finish. Beer finishes clean, very easy to drink and is not overly carbonated. Yuengling is a good beer compared to all the macro brew beers ( Budweiser, Coors, Miller) and has a much better taste than any variety of those beers. This beer is also easy to drink, and recommended for any time someone would seek out a macro brew, like cutting the grass, enjoying a hot summer day, etc.

look: 3 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 1.5 | feel: 1.5 | overall: 2.25 This beer is the worst amber lager I've ever tried.

Of the cheap, commercial beers, this is a little bit better, but I still poured out the last half of the pint. I don't think I would reject this if handed to me, but I would never buy one again.

I compare all other lagers to this one, as its an American classic. Pours a little bubbly and settles with a smaller head and little to no lacing. Bright amber-gold color with a reddish hue depending on the lighting. Standard lager aroma slightly hoppy, but mostly malty and the taste follows suit with a sweeter finish. Growing up as a young adult, this is what I thought all lagers should feel like, medium body, not heavy. Easily drinkable lager and refreshing too. BTW, I would not call for a Natl boycott of this lager jut because Mr. Yuengling happens to endorse a certain Presidential candidate. That's extreme.   
look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.75 This is a decent beer; what can I say? There's a hint of metal in its taste, and its smell is not very distinctive. Still, it does have character for a mainstream beer.  I would definitely drink it if I got caught in one places where only a lager seems to be available.  I'm starting to sweat just thinking about it.

look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 I know I've written notes on this beer before; I just haven't typed them up. So here are some brief impressions from a 24 fl oz can (my first time experiencing Yuengling was on-draught), but a full review will follow in future. Cost was $2.25 at a Brooklyn bodega.    Pours a clear clean gold body and a frothy off-white head. ~6cm of foam takes ~10 minutes to fully recede, leaving no lacing.    Aroma has a subtle toasted malt undertone and a classic clean lager yeast strain. Vague fruit accents the bready amber malt aroma nicely. Not your typical budget lager, Yuengling's aroma promises a brew with body and flavour - not just watery pilsner malts. Aromatic intensity is average. As it comes to temperature, I get some slight spiciness - perhaps from Saaz or just from the yeast.    The taste doesn't quite deliver on the aroma, and the beer is a bit thinner than the aroma suggested, but it does have a surprising amount of body for a budget lager as well as decent complexity of flavour, replete with a subtle spiciness, some faint herbal hop notes, and an amber and pilsner malt backbone. A bit too slick and smooth on the palate, never taking time to let its flavours sink in, but it's not egregiously overcarbonated like many beers at this budget tier nor is it syrupy and thick like the malt liquors it tends to sit adjacent to on store shelves.    Overall, I find it balanced albeit shallow and simple, though a step or two above its macroproducing competition. I'll easily destroy the 24 fl oz can, and this is the kind of beer I'd be happy to order by the pitcher whilst devouring buffalo wings or cheap pizza with friends. It won't dazzle discerning drinkers, but it has its place as a casual brew that's priced right and offers more flavour and body than comparable alternatives. A crowd pleasing inoffensive beer that makes for a good go-to at bars and eateries with an otherwise limited selection.    C (2.90) / AVERAGE    ***  2016.11.03 impression on-draught @ a bar in Brooklyn.    Refreshing, perfectly medium-bodied, smooth, wet, coating, and adequately soft.    Drinkable enjoyable fare with no overt faults. A likable lager fit for pairing with pizza or a casual burger-and-fries type meal. Solid dependable fare.    C+ / ABOVE AVERAGE    ***  Reviewed from notes taken in February 2016 (the review I referred to above). Served on-draught at John's of Bleecker Pizza in New York, NY. Paired with pizza (obviously).    Served in a pilsner glass.    HEAD: 1 figner's worth of head. White in colour. Fluffy, foamy, and of average thickness with some decent creaminess to it. Retention is great: 7-8 minutes.    Leaves no lacing as it recedes. Could be softer in appearance and could have a better overall consistency.    BODY: Clear vibrant copper-amber. Clean, lacking any visible yeast/lees particulate within.     Looks solid for the amber lager style. Not unique or special in appearance, but well within style conventions.    AROMA: Caramalt, pale malt, 2-row, faint toastiness, clean lager yeast (no esters), perfect attenuation, moderate sweetness. A kiss of butter (though not diacetyl inasmuch as I can discern). Not too grainy. Has nice floral hop aromatics.     No alcohol or off-notes are detectable.    Aroma is of moderate intensity.    TASTE: A bit too sweet, but it's got a subtle faint toastiness that helps curb that. Plenty of caramalt, pale malt and amber malt throughout. Slight buttery flavour.     Floral hop profile comes off generic and inadequate (especially in terms of lending hop bitterness to balance out the malt sweetness). Imbalanced but nevertheless enjoyable.     Average depth, duration, and intensity of flavour. Not real subtle or intricate.    TEXTURE: Smooth, wet, medium-bodied, moderately thick, overcarbonated but crisp. Annoylingly buttery. Clean. Refreshing.    Suits the taste nicely enough, but it doesn't accentuate specific flavours or elevate the beer as a whole.     OVERALL: Highly drinkable but also forgettable. I'm glad this classic alternative to bigger macrobrew brands exists, but its amber leanings aren't committed to enough and it does have some balance issues. Ultimately above average and a great beer for casual drinking or pairing with pizza/wings/nachos.    C+ / ABOVE AVERAGE      OVERALL:

look: 3 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3 One of those dark lagers huh. The aroma is nothing to be proud of, I smell lots of alcohol despite this beer being only four and a half percent.     This is a smooth nutty lager, very little yeast presence, very little hop presence, and a small amount of malt presence. Easy enough to drink, a small dark fruit like bitterness that I guess is attributable to the yeast. This stuff is everywhere on the eastern seaboard. I'd be ok if I never drank it again.

Not much to add that hasn't already been said other than I agree that it taste better as it warms. I usually buy the bottles from Costco and keep them in my basement storeroom (the very definition of a cool dry place) and often times will forgo what's in my fridge to drink those.

Slight but good aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Light, a bit watery.   Overall: Nothing special, but better than other American lagers. Very consistent taste. Probably the best offering from the brewery.

There are really two types of situations I'd choose to drink Yuengling in: a bowling alley, and a cookout twenty years ago. It's a very basic, watery lager that gained tons of panache from being nostalgic and out of Rhode Island distro for a while. It came back, and it hasn't aged well.

look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 This beer has a light amber color with a medium head. The smell is of sour grains and wheat.

Now there's only one can. Poured into a standard pint glass, this beer pours a clear, medium amber color with a nice white head that's initially about 2/3 of an inch thick when first poured that eventually settles to a very big crescent shaped cluster swirl of foam that covers 80% of the beer's surface. Not too much lacing. Aromas of some slightly toasted, biscuit, caramel malt sweetness along with some fairly mild, earthy and piney hop bitterness notes. The taste is pretty much the same, with slightly toasted, somewhat biscuity, caramel malt sweetness followed by a bit of an earthy and slightly piney hop bitterness to round out the flavor profile. A very nice balance of the flavors, I just with everything wasn't dialed back here. The flavor profile needs to be stronger all around IMO. No off flavors of any kind or metallic adjunct flavors, etc. Just not a strong enough flavor profile overall for me. Has a crisp, yet smooth, light to medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. A decently good beer all around here.    Eric

Medium light hop bitterness through the middle along with a trace of spicy hop bite. Caramel malt flavors return near the end . Finished semi-dryly with sweet caramel malt note followed by light grainy malt aftertaste. Pretty easy drinking. A cult staple in PA.

But I like to know where each beer I've had sit against one another. This score might seem low, but compared to my scores for similar mass produced american lagers it might be generous. This is a pretty good beer, one you order, when for some reason, a restaurant has twelve American Lagers on the menu and nothing else. Drinks very very light and easy, there is a decent amount of color and flavor that the light body doesn't bother me all that much. Not overly hopped, the flavor seems to me heavy on barley and water.

It pours a clear amber color with a one-finger, milk-white head and lacing that persisted throughout the pour. It smelled of sweet malt, corn, and earthy peat. The taste largely follows the nose. It has a sweet malty flavor with a slightly malty flavor at the finish. This is a light ale, moderately carbonated, and highly sessionable with an ABV of only 4.5% Overall, it is an historic standby. It doesn't have a lot of taste but is an easy drinking East Coast lager.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Well refrigerated from a bottle. This beer has a really nice amber color and above average carbonation. This tastes like a solidly mainstream lager with lots of hops and mild malt flavors. Overall it feels heavier/fuller than many other lagers, but noticeably less alcohol than an IPA.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 The beer I generally consumed in my 20's and early 30's.    Pours an amber to dark gold color with minimal head. Smell has a little grain to it and a hint of hops. Taste has an over layer of syrup to it but mostly is malt with a little corn and a finish with hops. The finish is clean and does not linger long. Mouthfeel is light, a small amount of carbonation. Overall a decent lager, certainly one I enjoyed earlier on and one that is nice to return to and take a break from craft beers for a while.

It tastes somewhat bland, with a light creamy and malt note, with a very modestly hoppy aftertaste. Taste is not bad at all. The mouthfeel is light and easy going. Overall, this is not a bad beer at all. For the price and level of availability, this should be a go to beer for starters who want a session beer. I would highly recommend this beer as one of the best of macro American adjuncts.

Look: Reddish brown (amber)  Smell: A little skunky (Bottle) Grainy from a can  Taste: Malt a little bit of hops  Feel: Medium thickness, carbonation  Overall: Very refreshing, can't go wrong with the lager. For some reason the can and bottle taste different probably due to the green bottle, I prefer the bottle over the can, because I think it has a stronger taste

look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 This beer is what started the craft beer thing with me, so it does have a warm place in my heart. It pours an amber color, with a fairly thick head. There isn't much nose there. The taste circa 2005 blew me away. Today, it's still good, some malts, some hops, but I've tasted so much better. For what it is, it's good, and will always hold a special place in my heart. Whenever I'm in Yuengling land, I'll get some.

Yeah it has corn in it. But cmon.. im paying around 72 cents per can, and it DOES taste good.    Far more "complex" than other adjuncts. A malty sweet flavor, a sort of creaminess, and a very slight hop bitterness. Was interesting to learn they use cascade as well as cluster (im sure in minuscule amounts) but it made sense as there is sort of that citrusy zing to it albeit very subdued.    Its not a great beer by any stretch, but its very solid and if price vs taste is taken into consideration, this is an incredible value beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 Let me say this first, I am no fan of American lagers. That said, I believe this is the best American lager in that it is different and better than the Bud clones.    Dark for a lager, almost Amber. Foamy white head. Smells hoppy like most American lagers, but the taste is more well-balanced, probably because of the roasted malt. Extremely drinkable and all-around very well made beer.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 The more things change the more they stay the same. Yuengling has tweaked their basic lager recipe over the years but kept the same profile which is an above average brew for the common man. Works for me.    Clear amber tone with mild/medium malt aroma. Little hop presence (had to search for them) but a malty richness absent from other AAL brands. Oh it's not first list, nor does it pretend to be, but a Mecerdes won't get you to the grocery store any better than a Chevy.    Taste good, widely available, bargain price, what else can I say.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Poured from 24 oz can into 10 oz mug. Pours an attractive amber color, pretty see through with a fluffy head that dissipated rather quickly leaving a little bit of lacing.  Smells earthy and pretty malty, maybe some corn thrown in there.  Tastes of corn, malt and maybe a tad bit of hay? Very pleasant, no bitterness. Not overly sweet, however. Damn good.  Mouthful isn't super thick, but it's very drinkable and goes down rather nicely. Medium body and a tad bit carbonated.  Overall, very very pleasant to drink and one of my favorite lagers to date.

Pours a light reddish brown with a thin head that leaves some okay lacing. Smell is corn, grain, and some faintly toasted malt. Taste is the same. Not bitter at all, but also not overly sweet. Nice sweetly earthy type flavor that lingers pleasantly between sips. Feel is moderately carbonated and medium bodied. Definitely a good option for its price point.

I've always described it as the best cheap beer money can buy. Its a really good drinkable beer.   
look: 3 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3.25 Quick review: A nice everyday beer. A far cry from Blandweiser. Crisp clean mouth feel with no bitter aftertaste. A staple on draft in my local bars. Goes nice with most fare. Can have more than a few without feeling pickled. I keep this one on hand most of the time. Slight amber color. Head disappears quickly but this one goes down easy, so not much of a factor. Highly recommended for an all day beverage during the game.

If a bar does not have Iron City I then ask for a Yuengling. This beer is a step up in taste from Budweiser, Miller and Coors. It's a good beer. Did you know Budweiser copied the eagle of Yuengling? Budweiser sucks!

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 APPEARANCE: Dark golden. About 2 fingers of off white foamy head that recedes in a few moments and leaves a ring. Mild, short lived lacing down the glass. Plenty of small bubbles rising.  AROMA: Toasted bread, grassy, super slight amount of sulfur, a bit of caramel, and to me what I perceive as corn husk.  TASTE: Basically, a lot like the smell.  FEEL: Medium thin body, nice full carbonation, dry finish.  OVERALL: I think it's an alright, refreshing lager. If you want a touch more flavor for a few more calories than a standard light beer, this might work well.

Buddy claimed it was very popular and my guess is the history of the brewery and longevity of the beer is what makes it popular in its area, or simply the area has different tastes than the upper midwest?    Good beer but nothing overly special. Has decent body and not much of an aftertaste - for me this is not a go to beer, though it IS a good beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 WOW. No really, WOW. This stuff is ridiculously wonderful. It has a great taste, not too heavy not too light, not too hoppy not too plain Jane, not too carbonated, good smell. All relative to the price WHICH by the way is pretty darn cheap, but then again I was in Pennsylvania where it is brewed so it may be cheaper there. Put it this way, they should raise the price. It's WAY better than the Bud/Miller/Coors line up. Excellent Beer!!!

This reminded me of the smell from being outside the HS Bakery in Fells Point, Baltimore. Sweet on the tip of the tongue, malt and the faintest of hops. Moderate carbonation and body. This is the most drinkable of the American non-craft beers and the only one I will drink. No Miller, Coors or Bud passes over my tongue. And . . . this is an independent, not part of a international mega corp like Bud. When I have a party and do not want to waste good craft beer on non-caring beer drinkers, I serve this. Great with wings, steamed crabs and 'cue.

Pours a clear amber with lots of bubbly streams of carbonation and a finger of off white head. The aroma offers green grass, sweet corn, brown sugary grain, and toasted biscuit.   Caramel, toast, and corn hit the tongue, followed by green apple, faint earth, lots of freshly clipped grass, and a touch of lemon to balance things out. Quite crisp and clean--except for a touch too much of caramel sweetness, this is near pilsner level of sessionability.  The mouthfeel is light, but not thin or watery, and well carbonated. Very easy to throw back.    Though I don't drink this one much anymore, this was an old favorite, an introduction to craft beer, and still remains one of the best cheap, widely available craft lagers on the market.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 The beer pours a creamy white head that takes a while to dissipate. The beer itself is a clear medium amber color. The overall look isn't bad but it isn't very inspiring or anything super fancy. It's just enough to get the job done.    The smell is pretty simple but it isn't bad. A light hop bitterness mixed with sweet and very light caramel malt notes. Slight alcohol note. Although, it comes off as soda sometimes but it still has more personality than those other mass produced brands.    The taste is just as simple as the smell. Light hop bitterness with a slightly stronger light caramel malt note with a slight alcohol note that comes out fairly strongly.    The feel is pretty light with some biting carbonation. It has enough texture to be drinkable.     Overall, an acceptable beer for the craft beer geek if there's no Boston Lager around anywhere. This is something you bring out for parties where you need some mass appeal.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This isn't a beer I pour, smell, allow to warm (deliberately), or make a big fuss about the countless aspects of its flavor, because I didn't pay $10 for 6 beers. Although, I will say the bottles taste better than cans, justifying the whole $.20 price difference. I digress. Whether I'm on a lake bank tossing out a line, floating in a canoe sweating them out faster than I drink them, running a beer pong table, or on my porch playing guitar, Yuengling fails to disappoint. It doesn't taste like carbonated water, and it doesn't have the calories of a steak dinner. Right in the middle. Crisp, refreshing, affordable, flavorful, and pairs well with anything (especially another Yuengling). This was the first beer I had without the word "light" behind it when I was (non incriminating) years old. It opened my eyes to a world of beer beyond Bud, Miller, and Coor's, so I'm slightly biased on this one. Regardless, if you haven't tried it, give it a swig. There's nothing fancy or gimmicky about it. Just a solid, tasty beer. This is my "go to" when I don't want to spend more money on a sixer of something I end up hating. Cheers!

Feel: Feels like you're drinking from the garden of eden....yessir.  Overall: Highly suggest, if you're looking for a cheaper beer that has good taste, this should be your go to beer. HOLLA

Not terrible, but just really similar to the smell and taste of budweiser.

Aroma: Caramel malts, grain, toffee, a bit of fruitiness.    Taste: Rich and caramel-malty, both smooth and easy to drink. This amber lager is infinitely better than all the American adjunct “junk” lagers, and certainly one I’d not turn down if offered again. Maybe not a completely perfect brew, but one that certainly pleases for the price point.

Good amount of carbonation gives that prickley bite on the end of your tongue. Taste is sweet malts, grass, bread and light hop presence. This to me is just a good representation of the style. Smooth well balanced and very drinkable. Not a world class beer, but in my opinion, a very enjoyable Good beer!

Taste is caramel, some adjunct grain, corn, some hints of toffee. Good carb, and very easy and refreshing to drink. I've also had it on tap and in the bottle, but much prefer this beer from the can. Much better option than any of the other adjunct type styles.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12 fl oz. can, no apparent canned on date. My first encounter with a can of Yuengling, gifted to me from a friend.     Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.    A - It pours a nice coppery amber body- a touch darker than I expected. About a finger and a half of frothy off-white head. Leaves some good sticky scattered lacing behind. Looks good, considering it's reputation.    S - A creamy, grainy, almost doughy sort of aroma. Sweet & malty, to be sure. Some brown bread perhaps, and maybe just a slight note of floral alcohol / metallics.    T - Taste follows the nose: sweetened, creamy, & grainy all around. Toasty & nutty, with a bit of bready malts and brown bread. A bit of traditional doughy earthy yeast in there as well.    M - The feel is crisp, smooth, & creamy. A nice dry, yeasty finish. Medium-light bodied, but drinkable and quenching.    Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with my first can of this stuff. I would rank it right up there with Samuel Adams Boston Lager in terms of flavor and drinkability. This one is packing a lot of flavor for a low abv. Would love to get more of this stuff.    Yuengling Traditional Lager -----4/5.

T: A light and grainy "American" with an initial rush of toasted bread, malt, toffee, and occasionally a slight metallic aftertaste.   F: Smooth and refreshing with ample carbonation that almost foams at each sip.   O: Simply stated this is my favorite large-scale traditional American brew. Its balance and hints of toasty malts set it apart from its macro peers- even its metallic imperfections pale in comparison to any old labels coming out of Milwaukee.
