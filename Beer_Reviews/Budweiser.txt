look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 33cl bottle, 7m old.    Very light straw, extremely clear. Foam is weak, disappears completely, no lace.    Nose is grain, not a strong aroma, but it is exactly as a well-made pils ought to smell like. Very little hops, though. Diacetyl notes.    Taste has even clearer diacetyl mixing with the subdued element of grain. And an understated crispness and edge, presumably from rice. Pleasant, smooth mouthfeel. No hop taste either in terms of aroma or bitterness, which is the main shortcoming... the crispness is the only element bringing any contrast to the smoothness.     In summary, a flawlessly executed subdued hopless version of pils/pilsner..Very well done for what it is trying to achieve. Unjustly over-vilified in my opinion. The diacetyl is not 'corn', maize does not provide much taste at all, and afaik Budweiser does not even have it. Use of rice is no more to sneer at than the Bohemian and German use of it in a very similar fashion at the end of 19th century. Adjunct process is a cornerstone of witbier, why would it be a crime here? A lot of craft beer is poorly balanced and inconsistent and shows little skill. Whether this style is very exciting is another matter, but you cannot fault the execution, as there is very little to hide behind. I suggest trying to make a flawless light lager of your own.   
look: 2 | smell: 2.25 | taste: 2.25 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.25 Honestly, it’s not that bad. I was never a big Budweiser drinker back in the day - Bud Light was much more commonly available - but it’s cheap, easy to find, quenches the thirst and is very widely accepted by all. Looks fairly clear, golden, clean with a little foaming white head that quickly dissipated. No real lacing to speak of. Smells mainly of grain and corn, just a little malt. Tastes similarly, with very little aftertaste. No skunkiness or bitterness. Clean, thin mouthfeel and decent carbonation. Goes flat fairly rapidly, however. All in all, a safe beer but not my go-to AAL.

Aroma of light malt notes with hints of cereal. Light bodied with high carbonation. Flavors are similar to aromas. Light malt and cereal flavors with light graininess followed acidic, medium light bitterness through the middle. Light grainy notes on the back end. Finished cleanly and  crisply with light corn cereal notes. It's been about 15 years since a had a Bud....basically since I discovered what good beer really is. There is nothing offensive with this beer. No off flavors or aromas. It doesn't taste bad. It just generally lacks character of any kind. No head, very light aromas, not much happening with feel, and lifeless flavor. On a positive note, it's better than Bud Light. Very easy drinking and crush able, but a pretty bland offering.

A horrendous waft of death in your face that slightly fades as time passes is the main thing you focus on for the first minute.     After the death passes, the taste is slightly bitter grain that lingers for a second before disappearing into nothing. You take another sip, and the same thing happens, again and again till the bottle is gone.     Pours almost clear, a nice mix of foam and carbonation, and a taste that isn't overall bad. Another plus is its slightly higher abv of 5% over most other light-weight beers. I wouldn't purchase for myself ever again, but neither would I turn my nose up at it if I were offered, its alright.

It's really been a study of a corporation attempting to maximize profits at the expense of their consumers. I worked in the rice paddies of Arkansas collecting water samples of the pesticides for EPA agrochemical impact surveys of the rice paddys. Workers were mixing tanks of pesticides with their bare arms before flying the planes spraying the rice. No wonder Arkansas has one of the highest cancer rates of all USA states. AB also introduced GMOs into the production line, hence the Natty line of high alcohol, bad hangover swill. As far as Beechwood Aging, nonexistent anymore except as an adjunct. I will still drink Bud on occasion, but rather not. I hope and pray they get their act back in order. It is nice to see they are attempting to introduce Freedom Reserve and the Beam Copper Ale lately, but it may be way too late.

look: 3 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 2.75 I deleted my earlier review and started all over now that we get full strength Bud in Oklahoma. I am using a new review format similar to the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) Score Sheet.    Appearance:  Pours to generous white head that falls to a thin ring and uneven lacing. Moderate to low head retention. Pale gold-yellow with brilliant clarity.     Aroma:  Extremely low levels of malt or grain. Super clean with no off-aromas but exceptionally bland and devoid of malt or hop characteristics. Some alcohol and cooked rice notes. Slight fruit likely from the A-B house lager yeast and short lagering cycle.     Flavor:   Folks, if you want a full flavor beer that is easy to drink and inoffensive and tastes the least like beer at a premium domestic price point then Bud is your jam. Clean, crisp and watery with seltzer, mixed with light cereal grain flavors and a slight crackery finish. No real hop bitterness to speak of.     Mouthfeel:  Light mouthfeel and medium-high carbonation. No astringency or harshness at all. This is where Bud shines. It feels refreshing and comforting, especially in the face of a hot day outside with baseball and hot dogs. If there is ever to be a case in favor of Bud being the Great American Lager, this is where it resides.     Overall:  In the grand scheme of beers, Budweiser is ripe for extinction on the following points:   1) Consumers are choosing beer less overall.   2) Those that DO like beer tend to choose beer that is either:  ----a) super light (mich ultra, anyone?)  ----b) super cheap (natty, the beast, malt liquors) ... or   ----c) more flavorful/craft beers.   --------Bud is 0 fer 3 on that scale.     The market for bland, flavorless non-light, premium AALs is shrinking.   The Bud name may have hope of living on as Bud Light , Bud Copper Lager, Bud Platinum or something else.     Let's face it. Traditional red-label Budweiser and it's tobacco counterpart Marlboro reds are riding off into the sunset.

It's a shame that the beer scene has become so snobbish over the last several years. There is nothing wrong with liking this style or other beers with "less flavor". Each style has it's purpose and comparing a Budweiser to something like an Old Rasputin is ridiculous. There is a reason that this beer sells like crazy. In the future I think the rating category of price should be included. This is one of my go-tos. For those who think they're too good for macro brews, get off your high-horse and lighten up. Not everything needs to display how "sophistcated" you are. LIFE IS GOOD! CHEERS!   
look: 2.75 | smell: 2 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 24 Oz Can poured into glass  Look - Most people know this but it is clear and yellow with lots of bubbles. Lots of soapy foam and some glass lacing  Smell - musty grains. Aroma is similar to an old metal bucket or something. Sweet buttered rice.  Taste - Very sweet and fairly basic taste. The rice comes through as well as some malt. Not much in the way of any hops or bitterness. It's not offputting in any way and drinkable although i personally get tired of the rice flavor after 1 or 2. Carbonation is medium-high. Refreshing when ice cold.    Overall, fairly straightforward beer taste, not gonna really wow anybody. It isn't the best beer in the style but its not bad. Would certainly drink it if someone offered me. I give this beer a C+

look: 3 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 How ironic my first review is Budweiser! For 20 years I've consumed almost nothing but craft beer and traditional imports - most notably Belgians, but also plenty of English porters/stouts and other dark, rich, endlessly satisfying more costly selections. What inspired me to review Budweiser was my weekend with friends and NO access to the beers I was accustomed to. There was plenty of everything you see on TV: Bud Light, Miller Light, Michelob Ultra. And since this was a *sophisticated* group, one cooler of Corona! (sorry for the sarcasm). I really didn't want to partake of any of those, so I drove to the local mart and grabbed a 12 pack of Budweiser in 12oz bottles. I soaked them in a cooler full of slushy ice for about 3 hours, and as we began preparing dinner I popped open my first Budweiser in a quarter century. As the glass tipped and the yellow/golden-clear American classic crept up the glass toward my mouth I sort of braced myself, reflecting on all the Cinq Cents, Corsendonk Pale, Westmalle Tripel, and Founders Oatmeal Breakfast Stouts that had conditioned my palette in 2018. Is this going to suck? Will I have to drink horse pi$$ all weekend?     As that ice-cold, crisp, rise-based nectar hit home my first impression was..."WOW!! That is GOOOD!!" and then I waited on the "bad"...the *something* that I was certain would arrive and justify and clarify all the hatred and derision this beer has attracted among my craft-beer-addicted buddies. There *had* to be a reason my friends snubbed their noses and chuckled as they passed the Anheuser-Busch section in our favorite beer stores. "I'm ready for it," I decided. But....the *bad* never showed up! This $.80 beer finished with the same clean, crisp (damn...now I sound like a beer commercial), refreshing, and TASTY character it started with! As I finished that sample, then another...I could reach no other conclusion than I was drinking a DAMN GOOD beer! No, it's not "complex." It's not "rich." There are no "notes of pine" or "hints of orange peel" or "texture of fine Swiss chocolate" or "subtle aroma of peat or almonds." None of that whatsoever.     What there is, though, is gobs of good, clean beer flavor without any lingering aftertaste. Recently I heard a craft beer aficionado refer to Budweiser as an "example of the watery crap Americans want these days" - embarrassingly unaware that Budweiser was formulated in the 1870s. I'm not saying they got everything right. But they got very few things wrong. And for my $.80 Budweiser is an absolute slam dunk!

Bud has a stronger flavor, not near as watery as a light beer, but still light enough to be a great session beer. Just picked up a 12 pack for $9, so a decent price for a quality beer. Ignore the stuck up beer snobs and grab yourself a Bud!

Tasted and smelled like its ingredients and felt super refreshing on a warm summer night, even if it was the closest thing to water i've had in a beer. I'd never pick it normally, but if offered I'd happily crush a few.

look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 In the spirit of America I bought my annual six-pack of Budweiser in cans. In a deep ice chest that sat for 5 hours bringing them down to optimal consumption temperature (ice fucking cold).    Pours the color of beer. Head towers for about a good minute or so then reduces down leaving random splats around the glass as I work my way quickly through the glass.    It is incredibly important to not let Budweiser warm, to any real degree. In its ice cold state there is nothing wrong with this beer. No major flaws, but also not much to contemplate.     I wouldn't make this beer more hoppy. I do wonder what it might taste like without rice - but I'm not entirely convinced it would be better.    I finished the sixer over two days. See you next year, BUDdy. You still have a friend here in NY.

look: 3.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.75 This is what it is and there's a place for this beer. My brother-in-law calls it an appetizer beer, one that you drink to quench thirst before enjoying something else. It won't spoil your appetite before you dive into hops, alcohol and Belgian sugar. Also when you're fatigued by such things. Anyway, I haven't rated this so : palest yellow, cereal hop smell and taste, light refreshing feel. If rather have a kitsch or helles, but I'm not pouring it down the drain.

Lots of rice and cereal grain flavors. Very little hops character. A classier party beer for maximum consumption. Float trips, concerts, sporting events. Good ice cold on a hot summer day. A good Hefe is better though.

A: Pours a crystal clear, golden color with a one inch, white head, low retention and no lacing to speak of.   S: Floral and apple notes with grainy maltiness, but very low aroma overall.   T: Light and refreshing with light maltiness and very light bitterness leading to refreshing finish.   M: Light bodied with low volume but persistent effervescence.   O: I find the unusually low scores a bit inconsistent with reality. Budweiser is an American adjunct lager and a very well made one. It is not going to have the “big” flavors of many other styles, nor should it, as it is basically designed to be light and refreshing (and is). No fan of the “Macrobreweries,” but it does not mean the beer is not well made.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Budweiser American Lager is among the best beers I have had. I understand why it is the King of beers. Sweet Malt and low hop bitterness make this beer very palatable and easy to drink and easy to enjoy. The first time I had this beer, I thought it was bad. In the can, it really had no flavor. Recently, I wanted to give this beer another try; this time in the bottle. Wow this beer was delicious and so enjoyable in the bottle. I love the wonderful full malt flavor and low hop bitterness. The smell is like yeasty bread from the oven. The feel is light like all lagers are. The color is nothing amazing neither is the head. I just enjoy this beer straight from the bottle so i tend to not care about color unless its a amber lager or a stout. The presentation of a Budweiser is classic and as American as it gets. Who wouldn't know that timeless red label? Many beer drinkers love to bash this beer. I was almost one of them, until I got some experience drinking many other brands of lagers. There is nothing to hate about Budweiser, it is absolutely a fantastic classic Brew. This beer goes with anything: bbq, burgers, franks, anything you please. Heck put it on ice cream! Nothing but thumbs up from me!    By the way, I called Anhueser-Busch with a question and they answer the phone and handle your concerns with respect and professionalism. Thats more than what I can say for Another brand ie: pabts

A clean lager taste but ruined by a slight taste of beer fruit flies have been living in for a week or two.   I've seen something in advertising saying it's beech wood aged? Why the freak would you age a light beer?   How are their cheaper beers better?  How can they call this the best beer in the world?   Seriously I swear this is just expired Busch relabled  Can we please file a class action lawsuit over their gratuitous and false advertising?   
look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 24 ounce can into lager glass, best before 5/28/2018. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, white bread, light biscuit/dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/grain and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, white bread, light biscuit/dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Very mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread, light biscuit/dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of pale malt/grain and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors; with zero yeast notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, fairly bready/grainy, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is good. A bit thin, but not watery. Zero warming alcohol for 5%. Overall this is a very solid pale adjunct lager style. All around good robustness of pale malt/grain and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. I liked that they don't use corn, so you don't get much fruitiness. Very clean barley/grain flavors and decent earthy hop presence/balance. An enjoyable offering, and very well made style example as expected.

look: 2.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 2.75 Drank from 12 ounce glass bottle. Ratings are done based on this style of beer.    Look - Bottle is a little plain, typical design with bland labels. Main label has too much writing for my taste. Dark brown bottle made it hard to see beer.    Smell - Very neutral smell. Nothing in particular could be picked out. Neither good nor bad.    Taste - Slightly more character than the smell. Hints of corn sweetness. Very little bitterness. Uninteresting but inoffensive.    Feel - Thin with just the right amount of carbonation. Very smooth and friendly, doesn't fight you going down.    Overall - The "King of Beers" shows itself to be an acceptable and very average beer. Nothing really stands out about it, making it a great background beer for parties, sporting events, or other activities where drinking beer isn't your main focus.

It looks like a beer and it feels like a beer, but the aroma and flavor are far from captivating.

It always tastes fresh. It is also very easy to find in can or bottle form (needless to say).   The price is right and as other people have said, quality control is second to none.     It has a nice color, is easy to drink and is carbinated well.     I have consumed several hundred different types of beers and like most of them. I like Budweiser and purchase it for hot summer days in North Carolina.

Budweiser has a fuller feel, better taste, and hell a higher ABV for what it's worth. It's not like you're getting many less calories drinking light anyway, and to me Bud is just a far superior beer in every way. It's still not good, but at a highly affordable cost it really isn't the worst thing out there.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 For all the bad representation Budweiser gets, I've always found it to be a killer beer for the style. Countless others may mud sling with comments of the beer being flavorless, without character, etc. I'm a beer enthusiast myself and while I enjoy craft beers of all kinds, I always come back to Bud for something simple, reliable, and drinkable to get the job done. The beer pours a bright and clear straw golden color with generous carbonation, a slightly off-white head which is excellent, although doesn't linger for a super long time. Aromas I get are a sweet and subtle malt presence, with a faint kiss of the hops to balance it out, a bread/biscuit smell, and cooked buttered rice. I also for some reason get a subtle fruity aroma of banana, which I actually love. Taste is crisp, clean and refreshing with a wet finish, and tastes pretty much like it smells. All in all an awesome beer for what it is.    I think the problem is too many people compare this beer to stuff like Ales, IPAs and stouts and things of that nature. This beer is not an IPA or any of that by any means, it does not have those characteristics. Nor is it trying to be. It is more reminiscent of a German style pilsner or lager than anything. But it's an American Adjunct lager through and through. And for what it is, it's a top notch beer in my opinion. Plus no one can take away that Budweisers quality control is unmatched so you will never get a bad batch of it and it will taste the same anywhere in the world you go. I will most likely get hate from all the beer snobs out there, but I'm an enthusiast, not a snob. I drink what I like craft or not without fear of judgment. Cheers!

I have enjoyed long-neck bottles of Bud if they are really cold and I haven't had a beer in a long time. What I find most useful about Bud is using it as a short-hand way of rating other beers. If it's better than Bud, it's drinkable. If it's worse than Bud, then it's swill that should be given to dogs or pigs. Example: "Lucky Lager isn't very good and it has to be cold, but it's better than Budweiser."

Its always fresh and the rice and the beechwood aging give it a subtle but unique finish. As for the look and feel, yeah its not great, but that doesn't even matter to me- its all about the crisp, fresh finish at a great price point.

It is, however, very drinkable and finishes nicely. I think Bud has a perception problem because (among other things) Bud Light is so terribly retched. People remember how awful Light is so they assume that Bud is just as bad... That's not true.    ** I've been drinking craft for over a decade. I used to scoff at the idea of drinking a few AAL's but as time went by, I slowly came back to try the old stand byes... I can actually appreciate these beers now while also realizing that there are better brews out there. People who look down their nose at beers like Bud haven't yet hit that point in their beer evolution to fully appreciate it for what it is and just enjoy it. I was a hardcore hop head for years but i feel like I'm burnt out on it. Let me know if this type of evolution has happen to any of you guys yet   
look: 2 | smell: 2 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.5 Bud is the old stand by. Still sucks in my opinion. If it is ice cold and you just did construction all day in Florida it tastes good! Once slightly warm the truth comes out. Brewers rice does not belong in any beer. Saki maybe.

Bud has been what I get when nothing more interesting or rare in this tradition is available when I go to restaurants. Still, it is over-priced in comparison to other beers of similar quality. Occasionally I will buy a 24 oz. if priced right, otherwise, I nod to bud and drink my Pabst or Old Milwaukee. Bud is generally better than most AALs in terms of reliably quality, I'll give it that.

Poured from a 24 oz mega can $1.99 at Randall’s into my favorite cheap clear glass. I was surprised at the pale weak looking color and the smell was unidentifiable grain. Despite a large white head it dissipates almost immediately. The taste is watery followed by a sourness that sticks to the roof of your mouth and never goes away. Very flat carbonation. Wow, I don’t remember it being this bad.   
look: 2.5 | smell: 2 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 I don't know why some people hate this lager but I find it okay. It has a nice smooth and sweet finish which is very palatable even after warming up.The rice is slightly dominant in this beer.  (will update this review with more details next time I am drinking it)  Edit - Appearance - Clear,light golden yellow.   On the nose - Pretty bland with a strong woody smell with hints of rice.  On the palette - Rice and sweetness, slightly bitter in the end and a smooth finish.   Light bodied and crisp.  I definitely had better lagers. This one's for easy drinking.

Impulsively, i decided to have one since it had been many, many years since i had drank one. I know why now.    It looks a pale yellow, as it always did, with a slight metallic grainy smell, but balanced right. Taste is bland, with a slight rice flavor approaching from behind but finished with a clean bitterness.    It is what it isn't. If you still love budweiser and you're not in Highshool anymore, either your financial status has not changed or your taste buds have not developed any further.

They're that good they cure baldness, straighten teeth and add a few inches to your manhood. If you stand with one of these bad boys you'll look cooler than Steve McQueen in Bullitt.  I'm going to share the secret to it all with everyone because I'm a generous guy.    Step 1: Ask the barman for a Mark Chad  Step 2: Confirm that it is ice cold  Step 3: Apply your bottle cosey  Step 4: Stick your finger in the top of the bottle and pop it  Step 5: Skull that bad boy before it gets warm, but make sure you look cool when you do it. (Try leaning against a pillar or wall. If a pool table is available for a game then even better, the Mark Chad makes you play like Ronnie O'Sullivan on ritalin!)  Step 6: Leave the smallest amount in the bottom of the bottle  Step 7: Repeat previous steps 15-20 times  Step 8: Spark a J whilst all the birds give you their phone numbers    Congrats on learning about the king of beers!

It’s got a beautiful golden color, bubbly, and is really all I could ask for in a beer.

So imo, Bud therefore tastes like a normal basic beer, just watered down.

look: 3 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 12oz can bb 10/4/17 poured into a shaker pint at fridge temp 5% ABV. The beer pours bright and light straw in color. The head is white and lasts about 3 minutes before receding to an island of tiny bubbles. There is a hint of beer smell in the aroma. The taste is semisweet malt and then a semisweet aftertaste that hangs out for a minute. Mouthfeel is thin bodied, very carbonated and dry. Overall, good. I'm surprised, I expected this to be terrible even though it used to be my favorite. This is a good AAL. No off flavors or defects to my taste.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3 I got into craft beer early, so I skipped on most of the big beers. Thought I'd try them so I could see what all the (anti-)hype was about. Today, it's Bud. 25 ounce tallboy with the "America" theme, poured into a large glass tankard.    Look: Clear, yellowish-gold. An aggressive pour gives three fingers of foamy head, that slowly dissipates to a thin ring. Not much in the way of lacing; any foam generated from swirling quickly slides down the glass, leaving no trace of its presence.    Smell: Very faint smell of ethanol and white bread, maybe a little corn. Not too strong, not too pleasant, but not offensive either.    Taste: It doesn't taste bad, per se, but it's very mild. The primary flavor is corn. Candy corn, to be exact, due to the sweetness of the malt. No strong hops flavor or bitterness. The hops are definitely present, keeping the sweetness in check, but not really standing out. Vaguely grassy aftertaste. Drinkable, refreshing, but a little bland.    Mouthfeel: The body is a bit thin and the carbonation is rather strong. It's very much like Perrier, and goes down smooth, making it easy to chug down.    Overall: As I said earlier, it doesn't really taste bad, it's just very simple and mild. The 5% ABV makes it a decent choice for a cheap buzz, if that's what you're looking for, as it drinks quickly. I probably won't buy any more, but if a friend handed me one at a barbecue, I wouldn't turn them down. I am, however, now very interested in tasting Bud Light, as I can't imagine something tasting too much lighter than this.

A slightly sweet/grainy aroma, maybe a hint of corn initially. No hops    Flavor is like the aroma initially, but balances out by midmouth with a hint of a muted earthy hop flavor. Finishes very neutral and clean.    Low-med body, med-high carbonation.    I know my review will be way above average. Do I think Budweiser is a great beer? No. Do I think it does a good job of being a clean adjunct lager? yes. I've told people in the past if they amped up the bitterness and noble hop flavor it might be pretty decent. Maybe I'm wrong.

The uninteresting taste, smell, and average lager yellowness reflect its compromising nature as a typical adjunct: Just a careless, slap-shod combination of ingredients blended to be as unremarkable as possible, and, of course, save the brewer on overhead.    Absolutely awful, a quality which is compounded by the fact that the company insists on marketing this swill as a "Macrobrew," deliberately advertising its nature as a corporate, mass-produced, underwhelming and unimaginative product, as though spitting in the face of actual quality were some sort of virtue. With any luck, future generations will, through the free market, erase this garbage from the face of the earth.

Smell is grain, dirt, unpleasant malt/rice sweetness.    Taste is similar - neutral grain, unpleasant sweetness from cereal adjuncts, dirt/metallic qualities.    Mouthfeel is harsh, overcarbonated, super drying.    Overall, this beer seems to taste worse when you spend time to try and review it. just a huge lack of character and depth, and of the most harshly carbonated beers.

Smell: Slight sweetness, though not as much as when I had Foster's. Very little alcohol aroma.    Taste: Slight sweetness that comes up as the first thing I taste. May have to do with the use of rice since it has more sugar than wheat. Hops are rather weak. Not good if you want to have a good, well-balanced lager.    Feel: Clean, smooth, though quickly disappears.    Overall: Very mediocre beer, though this is a potential contender to some other AALs. It's not bad, but it could be better.

Tastes highly carbonated, somewhat sweet, extremely bland. Every time I’ve "sessioned" this beer in my younger days, it’s given me the nastiest headache. No other beer does this. Is it the formaldehyde (aka embalming fluid) they put in it as a preservative?   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.75 Re-reviewing after about six years. Found a rare FRESH fifteen pack for a meager $9.49 plus tax and deposit at the Monroe Sunoco.    Look - Crystal Clear golden hue with a large, bone white frothy white head and ample carbonation to back things up. Leaves a fair level of stick upon a finished pint.    Smell - Now let me be very clear. i've been doing this for a long time and I've drank thousands of cans of budweiser. You can tell the difference between a fresh can or bottle and an old can or bottle. There's a high level of clove with a slight banana ( believe it or not! ). The usual adjunct suspects stay minimal.    Taste - Almost completely follows the nose with that banana aspect turned up a bit. Of course the adjuncts are present but they are supposed to be.    Feel - Still a tad rough regardless of how fresh the brew is with a cold cutting carbonation. Swallows rather moderate and the taste doesn't linger.    Overall - Believe it or not this stuff isn't the spawn of Satan you're led on to believe it is. I see at least one new member a week bashing this for brownie points. Is it a record breaking world class triple ipa with haze reminiscent of snoop dogg's house? No. But, if you can buy it FRESH, you've got a cheap, moderately tasty poundable can of beer that may only hurt your head the next day. Quit bashing just because it's Budweiser, you look like an idiot.

In all honesty, I drank this swill as a young adult, before I realized that there were thousands of superior beers available. Now, if I have no choice but to drink it, it tastes like Fruit Loops, with it's sweet malted barley. If you're on this sight, you're probably familiar with Budweiser. You probably are also passionate about beer, and you probably feel the same way. The one thing I will say for them, is that they are very consistant in their flavoring. If you want the gut, and not the respect, grab a Bud!

look: 2 | smell: 1.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 2.5 For...science?     Pours a clear, pale, yellow color with a hint of a white head that faded away within about thirty seconds. Smells of, well, it does smell and honestly not very good. Malt, okay, floral notes, okay, moldy hay, not so okay. Taste is initially sweet, even a little bitterness, lasts about a few seconds and disappears leaving a faint metallic flavor. Crisp and light body. Overall, eh, drinkable. Not something I'd want to buy for myself, but would I turn it down at a party? Nah, I'd drink it.   
look: 2.5 | smell: 1.5 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2 | overall: 2 Haven't had one in 15-20 years. For science! Cheers! ;)     Pours light, clear yellow, as if it was 1/2 water/1/2 ("normal")beer. Quickly-dissipating white head, with a light ring of lacing.    Aroma? Unfortunately, yes. This is what turns me off AALs. It gets a 1.5 because it's not as strong as it could be, & therefore better than some. It consists of malt, wet straw, & some floral? sweetness. Overall it smells like a milder version of the morning after the night before.[Additional note : as I burp half way through this, I'm getting the original aroma, magnified. Ugh.]    The taste is better than I remember it, and at least tolerable. Light, bready malt, and a light touch of bitterness on the finish. Reminiscent of some pils & helles, that I've had recently, but the ghost of them. What flavor is there quickly fades, inviting another sip. (The secret to their success? ;) )    Feel is thin/watery/oily, with very fine,smooth carbonation, and (unfortunately) leaves a rubbed-with-wet-cardboard sensation on the tongue. (Again, demanding another sip. ; ) )     Overall, not particularly good, but not completely horrible either. I can see how people could get used to drinking it.    Additional note : 10 minutes later, I'm tasting it again, wondering if I should give that a separate rating. : P

Overall: I paid AUD$12 with a coupon and I would not pay more. It is easy to chug for a party etc. but the high carbonation would turn me to better cheaper Australian lagers (VB or Tooheys both being easier to drink, with more flavour)

Well, actually not about the beer itself but perhaps about the way people should look at it.  This beer should not be compared to any craft beers, but should be appreciated for the way it should be drank. It is a clearly brewed, American adjunct lager that should be drank ice cold at the end of a hot summer day for refreshment. For this purpose it is excellent. A clear, light and refreshing drink. In this quality it is great. As a beer, however... well, it depends on what we consider as one.

It pours a slightly less pale yellow than its light counterpart, and tastes as if there's half beer half water (as opposed to probably 1/3 beer, 2/3 water for bud light). It has very minimal flavor, is overcarbonated, but is actually very smooth going down. This is the beer you drink when you're planning on pounding 12+ to get blackout, without sacrificing the super-low ABVs and cardboard taste of light beers. At a modest 5%, Budweiser will get the job done, but it won't be a great experience, that's for sure.

Anyway, here I go.  Pew! The nose is really stinky. Not a good experience. Okay, here is the pour....carbonated, as these fluffy drinks usually are...with an ugly colour. Okay, how is the taste?   Oh, man, this is awful! How is it even allowed to be printed on the can that this garbage "produces a taste, a smoothness and drinkability you will find in no other beer at any price"? How is making a statement like that legal? It is also not world renowned and definitely not the king of beers. If you can't prove something, you shouldn't be allowed to market it for profit.   Someone here said that this is classic lager. This is most certainly not that. Not even in the same ballpark. Try some real lager and you'll know what I mean. This is classic rip-off. A bland (no hops, hardly any barley, some rice), poor excuse of a beer (beer?) of any style.

look: 2.25 | smell: 2.25 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.5 Good old Bud. Let's be honest...no one buys this beer as a delicacy. It is the drink you remember your dad pulling out of the cooler at barbecues. By no means is it incredible, bursting with flavor, or interesting in any way, but it's american and it's cheap.    Other than at a baseball game or handed to me free of charge, I doubt I'd buy this beer.

Aroma is a classic lager, light hops, easy barley, a tiny bit of citrus. But the taste is very different. I feel that Budweiser is too fruity and it ruins the taste of the beer. Also, none of the sips are consistent with other sips. Others may like this beer, but it is not for me.

I prefer this classic recipe over bud light, miller lite, corona, or coors any day.

Just like any other cheap corn beer it has a light yellow color to it. Nothing special there. The smell is actually ok, though. Slightly hoppy/corn/sweet smell for me. It tastes pretty good too. Better than Miller High Life which surprises me because that use to be my main cheap beer to go to all the time. It feels great going down, even when it's warm. Overall this beer is pretty good for the price. I've personally been missing out this whole time.

This comes served to me in an aluminum bottle, incrested with the seal of American prosperity ("Budweiser" written in a slight cursive font) with the promise to get me slightly closer to that American dream with every sip. Getting drunk off Budweiser and screaming at the cat that things were better the way they used to be.     What happened to the flying cars they promised? And who is this Cardishpanini family they keep talking about on the news?     I think I'll just crack another Budweiser with Andy Griffith and Barney Fife and watch the time tick on.    Now where's that cat...

Goes down easily and has a malty taste. Not THAT bad....as in "awful". Although I will admit that I am biased as this was our standard beer during our late high school/college days. That's when imports were a BIG deal.......way before even Sam Adams.

You wouldn't rate a bag of rice a 1 just because it doesn't taste like Rice-a-Roni.     That being said, I think my favorite experience ever with a beer was with a Bud. I was at a Bulls game and was ridiculously thirsty. My girlfriend brought me back a Bud, and my God...I downed half of it and almost cried from the satisfaction. This is a very mild, watery beer with heavy carbonation. It's not particularly bitter, but not particularly sweet - it almost taste like a cup of water that had a piece of bread i. it for a week. While that sounds disgusting, and would be to beer snobs, it's actually quite refeshing!    Overall, I don't drink it on the reg, but I have no problem having it on a hot day, or when I'm thirsty. Sometimes you just can't over analyze things.

What makes this beer good is that enjoying them on the 4th of July or at a baseball game is as American as it gets and it doesn't taste too bad when it's only a couple times a year. It tastes better when you drink it during those times.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 I poured this out of a 12oz can into a glass tumbler.  I will be reviewing this beer against the AAL category.     A- Light golden yellow, lots of bubbles, clear, with a 1.5 finger head that quickly disappears to a ring in the glass.    S- Sweet grains, some malt. Fresh water. Nothing offensive.    T- I taste grains, a teeny tiny bit of hop bitterness, some ricey taste, a little malty. Very smooth.   It has a clean taste. Not offensive.  Very palatable.    Mouthfeel- Bubbly. Watery. Clean. Light.  It has a slight aftertaste: grainy and slightly malty, but it's nice and pleasant.     Overall- I think this beer is an excellent representative of an AAL.  Budweiser is smooth and easy to drink.  I think this will be my cheap to-go beer from now on. It's very refreshing.   Pretty good for $19.86 for a 30pack, all tax and crv included.   
look: 2.5 | smell: 2.25 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.25 Budweiser is definitely not the best of the big corporate brews. Like the rest, it drinks like water and has a largely inoffensive taste, but it leans to the hoppy side for an American adjunct lager. Unfortunately, the overall effect is just too empty and the balance too clumsy to really feel refreshing. Even if you're looking for a mindless, crushable offering, you can do much better for yourself. I'll always be scratching my head over how this became such an American icon.

Best before 25 December 2016.  2.25/1.5/1.5/2.25/2  A: Pale, clear, and effervescent. Light head immediately dissipates. Straw-gold and pellucid.  S: The fetid, sweet grain floats above the glass and is immediately distinguishable. Mixed with skunky/earthy hops.  T/M: Fizzy-sweet and initially refreshing. There's something akin to the SEA rice lagers here; it's quaffable cold and in quantity. Here, under scrutiny, under less arctic conditions, it fails to please. (Note to self-- if drinking, do not decant into a glass.) A mild touch of zest enlivens an otherwise shit-grain beer that is sour, thin, and vegetal (un-bitter). The aftertaste veers with a drunk's overcompensation, ranging from acrid, cheesy, and foul to clean, sweet, bubbly, and organic. The bipolar finish cannot justify the frankly paltry maintaste.  O: This is just barely drinkable...cold, from the bottle. Any opportunity to showcase its qualities should be avoided. Drink this as and when intended, and you'll be just fine. Half this iteration is going into the sink.

Smell: Creamy, but mostly of sour apples and sugary cereal.    Taste: Flavors of green apples, white grapes, creamy wheat and barley and mild sugar. People talk a lot of trash about Budweiser, but you could do a whole hell of a lot worse.     Feel: Creamy. Thirst quenching. Medium-light body, moderate carbonation.     The King of Beers? I don't know about that. King of American Macro Beers maybe...    Snobbery aside I really like Budweiser every now and then, especially at certain venues where there are no craft options available. One good thing I have to say about Bud is that it's so popular, it typically never sits on the shelf for too long so chances are you are always likely to get a fresh bottle, which is really important because Old Budweiser tastes like dirty water. Fresh Budweiser however, really isn't all that bad.

Smells of something a bit sweet with a faint aroma of beer (barley, malts clean water). The nose is pretty faint on this one.    Taste is kind of a creamy sweet taste. Taste is not bad but there are better tasting adjunct lagers in my opinion.    Feel is a bit more thicker than other adjuncts, which is not much more because most adjuncts are a bit thin.    Overall I would tend to gravitate to another side of the beer aisle and leave this one for those Bud fans. Beer taste is very subjective and this one just passes me by. However I do recognize the fact that this is still a nicely brewed beer made to refresh the masses and I am sure there are plenty of Bud fans out there that enjoy this beer.    HAPPY FATHERS DAY TO ALL THOSE DADS OUT THERE! CHEERS BA BROS!   
look: 3 | smell: 2.25 | taste: 2.25 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.25 Pours a crisp golden color with a nice white head.     Smell is a murky conglomeration of skunk, grain, corn, malt and skunk.     Taste is a watered down array of grain, bleached malt and corn. The sweet corn flavors become more prominent as the beer warms. It wouldn't be awful except that the flavors are so watered down.     Feel is light crisp and chuggable.     Overall, its just not very flavorful for the style.

Very little good can be said about this beer, The beechwood aging process seems to take a terrible beer recipe and make it worse somehow. I honestly don't know what they're hoping for, it's like a rice beer with an added flavor of pressure treated lumber. And somehow there's a subtle sweetness, that of a rotting cherry.

This is what I thought all beer should taste like, well things have changed a lot since those days. A friend gave me a few 12 oz. bottles of this, so here it goes. Been a long time!    L- Pretty boring look to this beer. Light, almost see through yellow. Finger of head that vanished quickly. Good carbonation, no lacing what so ever.  S- Not much there, malt and wheat. Little musty.  T- Smooth drinking beer, don't taste the adjunct as much as coors or miller. Malt flavor with a nice wheat finish.  F- Very light feel for an AAL. Easy to drink a lot of these. Smooth mouth feel, easy finish.  O- This is popular for a reason, it's an easy drinking beer that gives more flavor than a light. My buddy loves this stuff and I have no problem with it. If someone were new to beer, I'd recommend this as a first time. My tastes have changed now and wouldn't personally buy this. But, as an adjunct lager, it's not a bad beer at all.

Needless to say, that's not a common event. Drinking this is pretty close to drinking mineral water, it may have an okay feel if I'm dying of thirst under the burning sun of southern Texas, but that's about it. I don't understand how this is the best selling beer. People amaze me more and more as time goes by, not in the good way either.

I will spare you the details but there are many craft lagers available that are low ABV but have a much better taste than Bud.

In this place Budweiser is a legit King and isn't meant to be bashed. However, I'm a seasoned beer drinker and know good ales and lagers. Budweiser is thin even for a lager. The world's best lagers have a texture and this lacks it. I believe apple juice would be thicker. It's flavor is a bit mild and skunk even for something so fresh. This stuff was 'born' 10 days ago.. it's actually a decent looking lager on the pour well until the head fades to absolutely nothing. It's aroma is fresh and filled with a buttery Budweiser malt.     Overall - for a brewery that is one of if not the richest, having the best of the best equipment, access to the best ingredients, and given the fact everyone claims how hard Budweiser is to brew, I find it hard to appreciate it any way I look at it. It let's the drinker down when looking at it in those aspects. Idc how hard it is to brew. But what do I know?.. people including these folk have been guzzling it for years and think it's a king.

Smells of light grains and malt. Not any hops on the nose.  Tastes better than the smell, presenting a decent bitter start and semi-sweet middle with a nice finish. Not bad, honestly.  Mouthful is light/medium bodied.  Overall, Sure, it's one of the most popular beers ever. It's a macro lager, It makes sense.

look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 1 | feel: 3 | overall: 1 Today in honor of the St. Louis Blues playoff game I bought an 8 pack of 16 once cans iced cold and ready overnight to be poured into a pils glass. Far from a beer snob I was fired up and determined to love this beer.    There is nothing wrong with this beer other than it is the most bland and tasteless beer I have ever had with the exception of Coors Light. Inoffensively tasteless. A major letdown.    Will stick with Warsteiner and Radaberger on weekends and Schlitz Gusto on weeknights. Schlitz is far and away the best American non-craft beer , bar none, and annihilates "The KIng."

look: 3 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.75 This beer is clear and rather dark yellow. It has some lacing and a fluffy white head. Smells fruity, sweet, and slightly grainy. I'm not too much of a fan of the overpowering sweet smell. It tasted malty sweet, fairly fruity, and somewhat skunky. The sweetness mixed with the blandness is not the best taste, though I can understand this flavor was designed with utility in mind - greatest pleasure for the greatest number. The feel is light-bodied and heavily carbonated. Not bad of a feel for a session beer. Overall, this is a decent macro American Adjunct Lager. I would recommend to starters, but no more than that. It smells skunky, is too strangely sweet, and offers nothing more.   
look: 2.25 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.25 | overall: 3.5 In the realm of marketing, this truly is "The King Of Beers."  But in the realm of product versus promotion, no amount of promotion is going to make Bud into a good product.  Nor will excoriating Bud and calling it "swill" make it better.   Bud is what it is: the most effectively promoted product of the 20th Century.    And we have this to thank AB for: Budweiser created the need for craft brewing, to save American tastebuds.    As for my review... Bud ain't as bad as its ratings. Sure, it Looks sickly. Sure, it Smells like it has a barley shortage. Sure, it Tastes like I just licked something so metallic that, I fear, it won't ever get off my tongue (until it does with some food.)  But Bud sure gave us a good reason to change the world.    Bud is listed on the "1001". As the "Taste That Launched A Thousand Brewers", Bud deserves to be on that list.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.5 A great all american beer. With a light brown color and not much head you can tell it is a mass produced beer, but it is light and refreshing with slight malt and a crisp taste.

Poured into an official Budweiser glass from the tap, nitrogenates (Budweiser Signature draft).    Looks awesome in this glass, nice fluffy head, moderate amount of lacing. High carbonation.     Doesn't smell like much besides malt... And water. It's 31 degrees, I'm not expecting much    First sip I hardly tasted anything. Second... Well, I imagine this is what Budweiser is supposed to taste like. Malt, estery yeast, and heck, even the rice tastes okay. This is really something else on draft. Amazing. 100% better.    Feel? Very smooth yet also just like water. Perfect for warm weather.    No, it's not very complex but it's Budweiser. I love the malt flavor and I'm a St. Lousian to the core; this is America's classic beer! Cheers for Anheuser Busch, and to all those that lost their livelihoods to the Belgian takeover. Here's to hoping AB survives into the future.

look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 This beer gets so much hate haha. WELL, for those of you who ARE fans of the classic American golden suds that paved the way, Budweiser is really a decent beer, not the best (in my opinion), just think of your standard marco, it's golden, bubbly, crisp & smooth with a signature beechwood finish. Bud is just so distinguishable compared to other beers in the same realm, it was not made to try and be something, it's just Bud, and it's extremely popular for a reason, enough said.

Look-Not too impressive light head that dissipated quickly. Not that many bubbles that float too the top. Very light and transparent.   Smell-Rice, grains, and a citrus flavor. It's nothing too special.   Taste-It has a citrus taste too it. There is a grain taste mixed with it as well. I might be able to taste a hint of malt. Overall, it's easy drinking.  Feel-It's nothing special, but it is the King of Beers. I really enjoy the nostalgic that goes into this beer and its bottling label. Try finding a better beer to have at a ballgame in July. It's a brand that Budweiser has sold to the American public.   Overall-It's nothing special. I would drink it again. It's a typical American Lager, it blends in with the crowd. It's kinda expensive for bulk drinking. There are cheeper alternatives on the market that are just as good.

Pours a medium yellow color, kind of like a dehydrated person's urine...appealing. Okay amount of fizzy white head, went away quickly and left zero lacing. Smell is sickly. Skunky, medicinal, and sweet like vomit. Taste is worse. There's something metallic and chemical here, I kept thinking it was almost like residue from one of the machines used in the brewery. Feel is thin and watery, very highly carbonated. Lots of unpleasant beer burps. If this is the king of beers, then I say "kill the king."

Back then, there wasn't easy access to real beer like there is today. One day someone offered me a Guinness Draught and I fell n love with beer. I began seeing and drinking a lot of good beer. Several years later someone offered me a Bud at a party. Stupid me didn't bring good beer, like I usually do. And let me tell you, when I'd bring real beer to a gathering, everyone loved it. I took one drink of that Bud and had to spit it out, before I got sick to my stomach. I will never again put any high volume domestic beer in my mouth, it actually taste like poison to me.

A month ago I chocked down a 12 pack of bud in cans, it must be cold and in a bottle. I watched Pet Semetary and Jud drinks bud in the bottle and I had to get 6 18 ouncers in da bottle, so much better! I hat canned bud it sends me into a place we won't talk about on here. Bud bottle the only way to go!

Crisp, dry, sweet but balanced. Accounting for price, availability along with all the characteristics rated, the king deserves to be revered.

I hate to admit it, but I poured it way too vigorously into a glass trying not to spill it from the can. This caused a hilarious sized head that took up half the glass. I poured a second glass from the same can into the then un-chilled glass (before pouring it down the drain) after finishing the first glass much more slowly and gently and it produced no head.    Smell: It smelled like a room filled with apples. Actually brought back memories of my childhood. I could also smell some grain character.    Taste: A bit funky. There was a taste that I couldn't really put my finger on, but it was odd to say the least. It might have been a combination of the grain and apple tastes that were coming through slightly.    Feel: I did get some carbonation, but I think the over-aggressive pouring killed it a bit. Either way I did find it had a refreshing quality. It definitely wasn't a bad feel, in fact I kind of liked it. It was fuller in feel than I was expecting.    Overall: I wouldn't say I thought it was terrible, but bad is definitely the right term for my experience. It was refreshing in a way, but since it's winter at the time of this review it really didn't make much of a difference. I could definitely see this being consumed on a hot day during the summer for the refreshing quality, but that's about it.    I checked the "birthdate" on the can: July 18th 2015. So it was about 6 months old by the time I consumed it.

The head is large, but it collapses into nothing, and I mean nothing. I detected corn in the nose. Not only corn, but something else which I cannot place. Taste is corny like corn niblets from Green Giant. Color is straw, pale gold. Was fairly fizzy, as there were many steady streams of carbonation rising up from the bottom of the glass, it also stings your tongue. An aside, this beer sends me right to the bathroom. Something in it does not agree with my insides. This is the only beer to do this. Haven't found another.

Honestly, this beer isn't terrible.     L- Pale gold, bubbles rising but no head.    S- Faint, maybe a slight corn scent. Nothing outstanding.    T- Very slightly sweet, almost fruity, hints of corn and malt. Not strong at all, but not overly light either. Nothing to really hate about this beer, honestly it's incredibly easy to drink.    F- Smooth, slides down like water.    Like I said above, it's hard to find a fatal flaw about this beer. Sure, it's a macrobrew, and no it's not phenomenal; but there's something about the consistency of Budweiser creating this mediocre brew on a large scale that makes you feel proud to be an American. Sure, it's not a beer to be proud of drinking on a regular basis, but it's a beer that has survived the test of time, and is still a favorite among the general population. I don't usually drink garbage beer, but if I had to choose one- Budweiser hands down would be my choice every single time.   
look: 2.75 | smell: 2.25 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.5 A gift from a friend who refers to this as "golden delicious"....ummm...Thanks Kevin!    Poured form the can into a pint glass this easy drinking brew is pale clear yellow with a very nice head of white foam that lingers long with good sudsy lacing. Nose of sweet cereal grains and little else. Flavors surpass the nose with sweet sugary cereal grains that oddly enough remind me of rice krispies. Smooth lightly creamy and easy to drink with ample carbonation and a clean watery finish with a sweet aftertaste. Is it astounding, no, but this is an American classic that has it's place among the public who love their sweeter brews. A thirst quencher that brings back a very old memory of one of the best brews I had when young going back to a camp site after a long hot day at work. I will admit it has been somewhat pleasurable, but just not a satisfying brew. Sessionable. Indeed. But all in all it is lacking seriously in the flavor department.

Drank cold from the bottle on a hot day or a from a chilled pint glass with a juicy burger and fries? Hits the spot. Consistent, lightly floral notes up front that lead to the classic (overly derided) wheat/cereal taste. No bitter aftertaste, nothing cloying, nothing in the way of mouthfeel. It won't ruin your palette or steal the thunder from a well cooked meal, but it won't impress you either. There's a place for beer like this. After a couple of meaty IPAs I'll reach for a Bud to give my taste buds a well-deserved break and wind down the evening.

Finally reviewing the self-proclaimed 'King Of Beers', can gifted to me from a friend who brought over the twelve pack. Lord have mercy, here we go.    Poured into appropriate Budweiser pint glass. #properglassware.    A - Pours a ridiculously clear pale gold. Lots of bubbles in the glass as it pours. Manages to conjure a finger or so of bubbly 'head' that disappears before I can even get my camera out to take a picture. Looks like pee in the glass.    S - Smell of cheap adjuncts. Corn? Grain. Adjunct laden swill is about the only descriptors I can come up with. Smells like cheap shitty 'beer'. Hops? None. Rice? Nope. Grains & water. That's about all there is.    T - Taste is the same: cheap grains / adjuncts. Corn, corn syrup, husk. Flavorless swill.    M - Feel is smooth, crisp, clean, watery. Weak. Beer-flavored water.    Overall, not the king of beers by any means. One of the worst beers I've tried, and probably one of the worst beers widely distributed and available. Cheap adjunct swill, I probably wouldn't drink this again if even if it was given to me.    Budweiser -----1.5/5

I mean, it tasted like it smells... like beer. The feel was fizzy, and my overall judgment was that it is a good beer if you're not looking for a lot of complexity.

The ever so slight sweetness and taste of nothing make this beer very drinkable. Although it is the premium older brother of Bud Light, it is much more defined in its taste, whereas Bud Light could easily be mistaken for water, piss, and alcohol. I've drank at least 30 of these, and when I can't afford a six-pack of craft beer, I alternate between this Budweiser and Coors Light.

Taste is much the same. Lots of adjuncts, virtually no hop bitterness, watered down lemon. Not very good for a beer, or even really for the style, lowly as it is, but there is nothing about it that I would describe as nasty, either. It is, in any case, very refreshing and very drinkable. Light-bodied, but not too thin. More sudsy than I expected, figured carbonation would be a little more on the spritzy side. This helps with the smoothness and crispness I think.

I get it in China on occasion when the only other options are Dali or Snow beer - two Chinese brands that I can do without.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 Anheuser-Busch - Budweiser. 5.0% ABV. Standard pint glass ordered at a restaurant.    Look: Transparent golden/copper color, small white foamy head that dissolves quickly.    Smell: Very bold wheat and grain aroma, with yeast also strongly noticeable.    Feel: Thin with some medium amount of carbonation.    Taste: Typical American Lager. Yeast and grain are the most prominent flavors. Wheaty aftertaste, with no presence of alcohol taste. Not bitter at all, although it does not have much flavor either.    Overall: This was the first Budweiser that I had tried. Usually everyone starts with this style of beer, however I started with Porters and Stouts. This is one of the big name beers that everyone seems to drink everywhere. It is nothing special to me, just a standard watery, wheaty, yeast beer. Its easy to drink since it has a subtle flavor.   
look: 2.25 | smell: 2.25 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.25 | overall: 2.25 Appearance: pale golden coloured with light carbonation. Almost no lacing and retention.     Smell: grainy character, little alcohol and slight bready like aroma.    Taste: very light malts and a slightly grassy aftertaste.    Mouthfeel: a bit fizzy at first sip, then clean, dry and watery.    Overall: another macro beer that is just mediocre but not the worst you can get. Unfortunately there's a lot of it around.

Ended up drinking two glasses of regular Bud. "Born on" date on both bottles was clearly marked as September 10th, 2015.    Pale golden color; looked about the color of a Bud Light when pouring but was darker once settled into the glass. Perfectly clear, and with some bubbles rising up from the bottom here and there. A decent layer of bubbly white foam forms on top at first, but then it vanishes almost immediately, hardly even leaving a trace behind.    Does not have all that much of a smell at all. Maybe a very faint "beery" smell and some sweetness; something in there almost seems appley, oddly enough. Just very weak all around as far as smell goes.    Flavor is very light, but there's certainly more to standard Budweiser than there is to the Light version. Sweetness, a little hint of something that seemed almost nutty at times, and some of that appley thing again. When ice cold the appley thing doesn't stand out as much, but when the frost has cleared from the frosted pint glass and the beer is allowed to warm up a little it starts go come out more. Starting to think that appley thing is a yeast thing, which wouldn't be out of place at all in a Belgian-style ale but seems a little unusual for a lager like this. Its presence does make the beer more interesting, though, as without it... there wouldn't be much to this. Are there hops in this? Because I don't taste any. Doesn't seem to have the same "bigger gulps = worse taste" problem that its Light cousin had at all, though, which is definitely a plus.    Feel is light and VERY fizzy. Not super watery like the Light version, thankfully! Actually comes across as slightly thicker/heavier than Coors, so I *would* give it a little higher marks for mouthfeel... but the fizz is just absurdly strong here, to the point where it feels a little too prickly at times. When the fizz calms down a bit it's pretty nice.    Overall... "king of beers" not so much, but this was not nearly as bad as I've heard it made out to be. The apple-like taste was unexpected, and that gives this beer a bit of its own unique spin compared to a lot of the other adjunct lagers. I notice that my scores for this are ending up exactly the same as Coors, even though I think Coors is probably the better beer overall... maybe tweaking the "overall" score could fix that, though I suppose it's not too big a problem if they end up with the same score from me.

look: 2 | smell: 2 | taste: 2 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 2.75 I don't think I need to review this, but I'll throw my opinion out there.  Poured it into a glass so I could look at the color I knew it was. It's a basic straw yellow color of its beer kind.  Doesn't smell anything special, smelled better than Coors though.  Tastes a little better than Coors, less watery than Busch, but not as carbonated or flavorful as Miller High Life.  It's smooth and easy to drink, mild to moderate carbonation, not much of a foam head to speak.  Overall, I had a Coors yesterday and thought it was insulting and offensive to my taste buds.  But this Budweiser I have isn't, I could easily drink these compared to other cheap macro beers. For a cheap beer, lets try to be fair, it isn't as bad as it could be.

The taste is the same, but with a rice sweetness. There are also some fruit esters at the end. The mouthfeel is carbonated fizzy water. Take it for what it is, a simple no frills beer.

look: 3 | smell: 2 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 3 You know what you're getting with Bud, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's clean, easy-drinking, unoffensive and a nice alternative to many of the over-hopped, high ABV and overpriced micros or "Crafts" out there.     I'll always prefer a hoppy IPA or strong porter, but there are times when I don't want to spend $17 on a 12-pack or don't want a 7.5-percent beer on a weeknight.     Bud pours light golden color, tastes relatively thin on the palette with ample carbonation. The flavor is unique, which could be attributed to the beechwood or the rice, and very lightly hopped. Almost no hop flavors here. Again, it's unoffensive but also not particularly memorable.     That said, it's a good option at $12 for an 18-pack bottles.

This is literally the homeopathic method of beer-making. There's virtually nothing but carbonated water and alcohol, and yet by utilizing the most minuscule concentrations possible, there is a touch of stale grains and metal.    The success of American Adjunct Breweries with beers like this are a testament to the fact that Americans are truly guilt-ridden self-loathing masochists at their very core. Hopefully this abomination that is blasphemously referred to as "beer" will die in due time with the brewing renaissance that has occurred in America lately and we can all learn to love ourselves again!

When you need a cold-ass soda water that is secretly a beer, this liquid consumable will certainly suffice.

Overall-I’ve heard them say that you don’t drink it to enjoy, but just to get drunk. If that is the case then you are doing it wrong. Drink better beers, please. You’ll thank me.   
look: 2 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 2.25 | feel: 1.5 | overall: 2.25 Budweiser pours a fizzy golden color, with a quickly dissipating head. There is a grainy and sugary aroma.

look: 2.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.5 A few days ago I had this on tap at a generic sports bar and now I'm having it in the 10 oz. cans that are so popular in St. Mary's County, Maryland for no explicable reason.    It looks yellow, like light piss. Er, I mean straw. It smells... like almost nothing. It tastes... like a light beer. When I had it on tap I actually asked to make sure they gave me regular Bud instead of Bud Light. The use of very rice is noticeable compared to other AALs. The "corn flakes" taste I've even come to enjoy a bit with beers like National Bohemian is completely absent, replaced by qualities that remind me rather of rice milk.     Overall this beer is okay. I'd say it's no better or worse than PBR. Budweiser is what my dad always drank and it sure caused more than a few arguments between him and my mother. Thanks for the childhood memories, Bud.

The smell is of rice and grains, one doesn't pick up much of a hoppy smell at all, maybe slightly in the background, but this beer doesn't smell bitter whatsoever.    The taste is the best part about Budweiser aka the King of Beers. It is a simply delicious taste that is smooth and crisp EVERY TIME. It tastes of grain and rice not hops. This beer doesn't taste bitter or hoppy whatsoever. It is just the perfect beer for every occasion that one can think of. The taste is always the same, they get it right every time.     The feel is a great part about drinking Budweiser. It has a nice carbonation and is as drinkable as water. Although it's as drinkable as water, it definitely has flavor. The mouthfeel is bubbly and smooth and each one goes down faster than the last.    Budweiser is an amazing beer. People look down on it because it's a macro beer mass produced not craft etc. There's a reason why this beer is the King of Beers, because they have made the perfect beer for every occasion. Beer snobs step aside and grab one while watching the game or grilling out. I guarantee you won't be disappointed. It just goes with everything, everywhere, every situation. The Budweiser Brewery Tour in St. Louis was amazing also. Much more appreciation for this beer when you see the steps needed to brew this beer in person.
