look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Opaque, hazy golden hue with a very thick, creamy head with great retention and lacing.    Aroma: Yeast, fruit esters, and wheat upfront. Notes of banana, cloves, nectarine, nutmeg, spices, lemon rind, honey, apple, and pear.    Notes of yeast, banana, lemon rind, pear, sugar, and honey are upfront, followed by much of the aromatic notes mentioned. Many sweet flavors present, however, and importantly, I believe the honey and lemon rind really help balance the palette by adding smoothness and zest for an overall good composition. Moderate-high carbonation, really smooth head and feel.

It’s boozy, spicy, and has clear tropical notes of mango or guava, maybe even marshmallow. An unusual and complex flavor profile. Definitely get grainy yeasty flavors too. Peppery on the tongue and good body. It grows on you. Drank right after a Duvel, which is n incomparable beer, but this is a great one too.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 A: Poured from the 750mL bottle into a tulip glass. The beer is a cloudy orange color with a tall foamy near-white head that sticks around for a while.     S: Nice, bright citrus - orange, lemon rind, spice. Some bread malt in there with a nice sweet yeasty aroma.    T: Citrus peel and light fruits dominate, along with a slight bready malt in the back. There is also a light banana and pineapple note in there, and more varied fruits and spices come out as the beer warms a bit more.    F: Crisp and carbonated.    Overall: This is a solid tripel, but not my favorite either in style or from this brewery. A good version of the style; accessible and very drinkable for its strength. It's a good choice, even if there are better ones to be had.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Unibroue's flagship beer, packed with flavor and mystery. A pretty unique tripel with a whole-mouth feel and strong aromas. The yeasty bottom is worth swirling for the last of the pour, giving nice hazy lines in a glass.  FDM is well-worth aging for 6-24 months at room temperature. Best enjoyed at or slightly below room temperature, definitely not rocky-mountain cold.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 L: opaque light orange with an impressive off-white head that remains for a good duration  S: malt, tangy, and molasses  T: semi-sweet, slight coffee hint, and chocolate  F: refreshing with great carbonation, like a quality champagne or a soda    Most people probably wouldn't associate a 9% ABV beer with the word "refreshing", but La Fin du Monde is a refreshing beer. La Fin du Monde is not a copy of a Belgian tripel, but is an improvement on the style. This beer is a must if you are a Belgian-style beer fan.

Be careful, this beer is so easy to drink, it could easily creep up on you. I usually have a 750 ml bottle, and I'm good, two 750 ml, and I'm close to drunk. Never drank 3, 750 ml's, I would not dare. This is by far one of my most delicious favorite beers, by Unibroue, I love the fruitiness, like apples, pears, some banana, corriander, which masks the strong alcohol. You taste a bit of hopps , but not too much, just the right flavor. I also like, Trois Pistoles, Don De Dieu. Emphemere, {apple} Uniboue, is the next best thing to Belgium Abbey Style Beers, I love Leffe, {Expensive}. Unibroue, These guys know how to brew, good beer. {period} Have one and see for yourself. If it really came down to the end of the world, This is what I would be drinking, with family and friends. { what a beautiful way to a tasteful end} Enjoy, CHEERS!

Twenty years and god knows how many beers later and it’s still my favourite. I love a lot of beer styles — pale, IPA, sour, scotch, brown, stout, etc — but tripels will always be special to me thanks to this beauty.

Aroma is lovely fruity yeast - banana, dates, pear.  Plenty of butterscotch and toffee on the palate, rich without being sugary sweet, it's a luxurious taste & feel. Velvety mouthfeel, medium body and carbonation, with a fine effervescence. Perfectly dry finish, and no sign of the high ABV, leaves you hungering for another sip. I get a lighter sense of figs, apple cider,

Very few bars and restaurants carry it, but I have been able to find it at a mega store. I haven't found it available on draft, only in bottles.    The carbonation is low (that's a good thing in my mind). The taste is slightly sweet. Overall, it's a smooth beer that you have to be careful with because of the ABV.

Poured into a tulip class from the less popular 341mL bottle over the larger true brainbuster, this one is a true tripel with massive collar and extreme effervescence just the way I like it with soft golden hues with only slight opaqueness - grand. Smells as a tripel should - grassy hops but far subtler than many triples so it eases you in to it's embrace. The taste evolves over time. The longer you go, the softer and fruitier the taste. Enjoy in soft pear, apple balanced with malts and slight spice - a truly balanced yet complex range here. Finishes exceptionally smooth with a low ABU of 18 but don't forget a 9.0 on the Richter Scale. At 10 dollars for 4 I find this a steal. Time for some U2 so you can talk to me "about the end of the world"....

T - Follows the nose, with yeast and malt up front followed by fruit esters and spices - banana, clove, honey, pear, apple, etc. Sweet finish - but not too sweet.   F - Medium body with a medium to high amount of carbonation - still smooth and crisp   O - This is a really fantastic Belgian Triple. It literally checks off all the boxes a triple should in terms of appearance, taste, and feel. I only wish the smell was stronger, but that's really splitting hairs on such a fantastic, textbook triple.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Finally trying out that bottle I had stashed in the cabinet. This beauty delivers.    L: An 8-oz pour from a 750 ml bottle into a goblet delivers two fingers of light soapy head on top of a hazy orange amber body. Hazy silhouettes are discernible through the partially transparent liquid.    S: Upon first sniff, I get the expected banana, nutmeg and clove, but I also get a juicy yellow nectarine that flows into a smooth white bread with touches of honey and pear. Surprisingly simple and light for the hype, and for the abv.    T: Wow. Peach, banana and vanilla are up first, but lemon rind and honey balance each other out in the middle. Yes, it does seem like a great addition to a black tea. I can't believe this is 18 proof. I thought Golden Monkey hid the booze well. This sticks the booze behind the furnace in the basement. It's a very mellow and unadorned Belgian Tripel.    F: Beyond perfect. Like velvet.    O: What a sophisticated brew. Like nothing I've ever had before.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Wow. Just drove 70 freakin miles to Total Wine to get this (and four others on my checklist). As a tripel lover who has had the best of the best, including the $100 a pack Westvleteren, this hits the mark almost perfectly. Great head with good lacing and staying power. Smell is a bit weak, but very sweet and full of Belgian qualities. Taste is that perfect refreshing, sweet tart-apple and pear/honey flavor. Not the best hider of alcohol, but it actually helps balance the delicate sweet flavors out, so I like it. Could drink this all day.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 If I had to drink only one beer for the rest of my life, this would be it. Complex, like a Belgian, but still accessable. You don't need a special occasion to enjoy it. Great with sharp cheeses, pub food, or dark chocolate.

Initial pour results in white, mostly foamy head, which takes a few minutes to settle. Each subsequent pour brings back the head, but less in volume each time. Patterns of lacing are left behind with each sip.  Aroma of pear, banana, melon, cloves, light vanilla, and bready malts.  Taste has green apple, pear, banana, melon, citrus lemon, light vanilla, clove, and grassy like malts.  Toward a full mouth feel. The citrus at the end makes it a little dry. High carbonation levels.  Really a sublimely made beer with lots of flavors and very balanced. Such a treat.

The Unibroue brews have a hazy look to them that I have a love-hate relationship with. On the one hand they kinda look nice, but then they have this weird look to them that makes me wrinkle my nose. The smell was unique - I call it, "Wheaty sweet" and I really liked it. Mouthfeel was full-bodied, quite carbonated, but it had a creamy texture that the carbonation could not deny. At 9% ABV, the sweetness I smelled still came through the boozy flavor adding something more to it that I found appealing. Overall, I found this to be exceptional and probably the best of their offerings I have had to date.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 L: Hazy, translucent deep gold with an enormous rocky white head. Very long retention, with lots of streaky lacing.     S: Lots of apple, pear, banana, straw, and clove; but instead of leaning sweet, it leans toward fragrant and floral; delicate with soft vanilla, honeydew melon, white grape, and sugar cookie.    T: Tart apple, pear, banana, lemon, orange, hay, biscuit, sugar cookie, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, white grape/white wine, and vanilla. Dry on the finish with hay and clove. Well balanced. Neither too sweet from the malt, nor too dry from the phenolics.    F: Highly carbonated. Feels so smooth and pillowy. Extremely well rounded. Finishes dry but not bone-dry, oh so well balanced.    O: One of the best tripels I've ever had, by far. Amazing.

They have other beers which can be lighter or heavier to taste, but this is pretty much the measuring stick for which all Canadian-style Trappist beers are judged. People may be put off by the cost, but it's fair to say you're getting what you pay for in terms of both flavor and effect.

Abundant froth quickly disappears, leaving only little lacing on glass.   Divine smell of yeasts and spices.   Full-bodied mouthfeel: flavor typical of Belgian Abbey beers (In my somewhat limited experience, Unibroue is the closest you can get to an authentic Belgian ale in the Nouveau Monde). This ''End of the World'' is a perfect 'authentic' Belgian Trippel.   Strong (9% ABV), sweet -- but not without some understated bitterness (20 IBU) and the usual spices.     A well established masterpiece. Also on draught in most Lowlands group cafés.   ~Feb. 2018 -- Milwaukee, WI.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a small chalice: color is hazy copper, head is brighter white with fine bubbles and presents about 1/2 inch thick and then dissipates to thin top with some spotty lacing.    Smell is light fruitiness, some yeast, light phenol and clove.     Taste is very good with pleasant light citrus and tropical fruit flavor, flavor then transitions to blend of light malt with biscuit and wheat notable, yeast with phenols and dryness, almost some weizen like flavors. Strength hidden very well by the flavor profile.     Mouthfeel is a highlight of this beer - pleasant with moderate carbonation, light sweetness and just enough dryness - nothing to detract.    Overall a great beer with slightly different take on than some other with a lighter presence with some softer malts; incredible flavor without the abv presence.

This is a wonderful beverage. I am very glad I got it and found it in a corner at my grocer. I probably could not drink a lot of these. Rich and alcoholic. I'd get sleepy.  i would highly recommend this beer.

While the Maudite was my first Unibroue beer consumed so many years ago, La Fin du Monde is my first review. Not a bad place to start.    Poured into a red wine glass, this beer is a hazy gold color with little head and no lace. It's a beautiful shade of yellow that is emboldened when held up to natural light. The nose is buttery lemon with earthy tones. Taste follows suit here, with a strong lemon/citrus presence, and noticeable clove as well. Distant pepper with a buttery finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth.     Perhaps not your classic Belgian tripel, this beer is delicious and is an easy drinking delight. While it may be 9.00% ABV, it's not at all boozy and in fact comes across as almost light at times. Would be just at home drinking this on a hot Texas summer day as I would sipping on a snifter of it sitting next to the fire place in February. Really good stuff.

The flavor is much more fruit forward than the aroma the aliceynes doesn't really come into play until the finish. It's fairly estery, but the sweetness overplays it.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with frothy carbonation. It's not overly bubbly, but is still very noticeable.  Overall, it's overly sweet. I haven't had a ton of tripels and need to make the effort to branch out into the style.

Put Québec on the map for micro beers. Available here for less than 3$ Canadian in most food and corner stores. It is a delicious triple ale in the Belgian style. Lots of complex flavours, fruit pale malt,s light hops, some bitterness on the final. It is a bit on the sweet side. Don't overdo it!. Better sipped.  Well worth a try.

Milder than I expected. Sort of like a hefeweizen but not exactly. About 9% alcohol but doesn't taste very boozy.  M: Full bodied. Very nice mouthfeel.  O: Quite a good beer. Seems to scratch the same itch that a hefeweizen or Vitus scratches. Slightly different though. I like it but I don't love it. I may try again in future.

Aromas of fruity pear, estery banana and pepper, bready yeast, candy sugar and sweet malt. Medium light bodied with effervescent, tangy carbonation and mellow warmth near the finish. Flavors are similar to aromas. Estery banana and light peppery notes, sweet sugary malt, light fruity pear. Medium, earthy, tangy hop bitterness through the middle. Finished semi-dryly with light boozy heat, yeasty and light fruity notes. Booziness is wonderfully masked making this dangerously drinkable. Fantastic array of complex flavors. An excellent triple.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; best by 12-01-19.  A: Pours a very hazy, amber color, resembling an unclarified cider, with very exuberant head formation, leading to a two inch head initially, but only modest head retention and lacing.  S: Aromas of caramel malt, clovers, and fruit (peach and banana), as well as complex spice notes.   T: Cloves meet the palate initially followed by a complex mix of the elements of nose. Bitterness present but subtle and nicely in balance.  M: Full bodied and thick in the mouth; solid persistent effervescence causing tingling on the palate.  O: I first encountered this in Québec in 2008 and have enjoy it many times. Really a world class Tripel.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Kick you in the teeth type of beer. Delicious, but you'll feel it in the morning. My first experience with Quebec beers. Hoppy and fairly strong, but you won't regret taking it for a ride.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 For full disclosure, I love dark Belgian beers and the dark fruits, woods, and chocolate notes they impart. But I struggle with pale Belgian beers because the banana and clove characteristics of the classic Belgian yeast are fairly unappealing to my palette. So I'm rating La Fin Du Monde as fairly as I can against the actual category, not against what I naturally gravitate to, taste-wise, and with that perspective the beer is very, very good, but possibly doesn't live quite up to its phenomenal reputation. Pours a pale, translucent gold body with a beautiful and effervescent head that holds well and laces minimally. Expected aromas of banana, bready yeast, wet straw, lemongrass, some lemon citrus, and strong phenols dominate the nose. I get a lot of mineral notes and a little stone fruit on the back end. Taste follows with familiar banana and clove, which on the first few sips is overwhelming but mellows over the course of the glass and opens the way for other characteristics to muscle through. Rye bread, brown sugar, lemongrass, pithy grapefruit, and just a little bit of piney resin show their faces mid-sip and on the back-end. Very delicate and smooth but also noteworthy and evolving. Feel is substantial for the look and pale coloring, with a viscosity (but not texture) that makes you conscious of each sip but not weighed down by it, despite the ABV. Alcohol is almost invisible and the beer drinks like a farmhouse ale. Again, not necessarily my favorite style, but for the category I can't imagine too many beers better.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 2 I dont know how this is rated as the top Tripel, Its not a bad beer but it is far from great. Tastes like so many other beers that try emulate Belgian Tripels, Quads, and Saisons and miss the mark. So cloyingly sweet it ruins itself.

M - Full bodied Belgian Tripel with a good amount of coating stickiness, medium amount of carbonation.  O - This is one of my favorite Belgian Tripel's (made in or outside of Belgium). I'll be getting more for sure, it's a perfect 'go to' any time. Maybe I'll see if aging does it any favors as well.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Rating: just drink it  Price: $    At the end of the day, it's whether you'll drink the beer again and again. This one you can't help but going back to. I don't agree with all of Unibrou's offerings, but La Fin is truly one of the best representation of Belgian ale brewed outside of Belgium. And, a lot cheaper.    750ml bottle purchased all over the USA.    If there's any detraction, it would be it's sweeter than some would like. But say you're trying to convince someone to move from a fruit beer to something better, give them this beer. It's full bodied, very malty, very carbonated, very high ABV. I'll grab this beer over and over again...and share with friends!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Nearly perfect, in every way.    The beer pours a hazy golden-orange with a creamy white foam, but who really cares? The action is in the nose and flavor.    The beer opens with incredible boozy, spicy, banana, and tropical notes. More importantly, the beer offers such an inviting nose. I cannot quite place all of the individual components, but you just know from the outset that this beer will be incredible. In short, the smell is intoxicating.    The flavor is so complex that it's hard to describe. You open with this tingly and citrusy flavor. It tickles the palate and opens it to the flavors that follow. Right after, you get this spice and orange---mostly allspice and nutmeg---that swell and envelop the palate. After, its a slightly sour citrus note---not unlike orange pith---with a substantial boozy component. Your palate is left with a delicious coat that suggests winter holiday fruitcakes, but distilled and clearly superior.    All told, this beer may indeed be one of the finest in the world.

Look: Pours golden with one-finger head which rapidly dissipates to thin lacing. A slow pour yields a much more minimal head with slightly better retention.    Smell: Grass, malt, yeast, tropical fruit all present up front on the nose. Very well hidden alcohol ester lingers in the sinuses.    Taste: Absolutely outstanding. Sweet tropical fruit (banana, mango), brown sugar, malt, grass, and spicy alcohol. Everything a tripel-style ought to be.    Feel: Super smooth with decent carbonation, does not feel its 9% abv at all, which makes this a rather dangerous beer indeed.

Pours a hazy orange with a medium large carbo release, a two finger fluffy head the slowly recedes through the glass. The aroma is of yeast, spices (coriander and pepper mainly) , and mild banana/clove. The taste follows suit, with only a slight bubblegum sweet addition to the mix. The mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is medium to medium high at the start, and mellows out as it warms. Always wanted to try this one. I like how the taste is well balanced and not quite as in your face. Recommended if you like Tripels.

Beautifully hazy and orange tinged with a nice white head. The scent was Belgian yeast with slight spice. Where this really stands out is the flavor, there is some sweetness and the banana/clove and a wonderful spicy smooth finish. This beer has a unique distinct flavor. There's less carbonation but it's just the right amount for this brew. Creamy and smooth. This is 9%...what?? Pretty well hidden.

While not being overly hoppy, it manages to have a perfect balance of bready biscuity malt and sweet clove.

The smell had a super nice allocation of iced apples, coriander, some peaches, and a nice Belgian spicy sort of yeastiness invading my nose. The taste was sweet and spicy and said a lot about a somewhat invading pear-like flavoring over top of the apples I previously smelled. I didn’t get any aftertaste but I did get a dry finish. On the palate, it sat about a light to medium and showed a decent sessionable characteristic about it. The carbonation seemed somewhat smooth but still had a decent sharpness running about it. Overall, in my opinion, this was a good Tripel that I would have again.

Yeasty and slightly alcoholic. I pick up a slight bit of spice. But not as much as I'd like though.  F- Crisp, clean, and kind.  O- Awesome. I loved trying this one out. Sometimes beer doesn't need to be extremely flashy to be phenomenal. La Fin Du Monde is an exceptional and sophisticated beer. Everyone will enjoy this one.

The head is beautiful with dense foam, the beer itself is cloudy with a delicious, golden hue. This is a beer that can bring together both beer aficionados and people who only sort of like beer. It has something for pretty much anyone who likes a good drink to appreciate.

Taste includes banana and bready biscuity malt, yeast, spice, and a little hop dryness but nevertheless treads a tad on the sweet side of balanced. There is a hint of a soapy quality to the taste that is faint and not unpleasant. The finish is extremely balanced and does not linger. Overall: Wow.

Aroma - Banana, allspice, sweet orange, musty.  Taste - Dried apricot, sweet malt, clove, white bread, banana. Much needed bitterness balances the sugars out. Alcohol is warming and sweet. Yeast towards the end with a very spice forward aftertaste.  Feel - Medium bodied, slightly gritty, light carbonation for the style, warming alcohol.     Overall - Sweeter, spicier and with more noticeable alcohol than most tripel's I've had. A little rough around the edges but still very enjoyable.

Mouthfeel is a bit too "digestible" for me (too much lights Belgian candy sugar to lighten the body?), but other than that it's a consistent, classic, perfect example of a Tripel. Taste is sweet and refreshing, not much bitterness or maltiness. Just a clean palate for showcasing the character of Belgian yeast.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 12 oz bottle, bb 12/18/17 into my St. Bernardus chalice. 9% ABV. The beer ranges from copper to gold with the light. Somewhat hazy but I poured the whole bottle aggressively. A half inch of white head fades to nothing but a thin ring with no lacing. Smell is slightly sweet and a little floral from the hops. Taste follows the smell. Mouthfeel is smooth and yet lively with carbonation. Overall, one of the best tripels on earth. I especially appreciate the subdued spice where other tripels are dominated by spice.

The beer pours with a great color and cloud, finished with a great head on top. I keep this constantly stocked in my cooler.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Loads of bubbles streaming up the glass, a very rich, hazy, golden to amber, with a finger of long lasting, white, foamy head. Sticky lacing. Lots of fruity green apple, and pipe tobacco in the aroma, smells malty. In the taste a white wine vibe that lingers, but up front, yeasty, sweet, but balanced, green apple, and tobacco, again. Plenty of carb on the tongue, medium full body, and dry. Winner winner, chicken dinner! Exceptional brew, right here.

Goes well with food or on its own. Lots to like here.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Some friends of my wife and myself were over just a few nights ago and decided to pick this bottle up from a local bottle shop since the NFL games were not going our way. We figured spending our time catching up and talking was more worthwhile than watching two NFL games that were not incredibly fun to watch.    This tripel (spelled on the bottle as Triple) pours a cloudy yellow hue with very high carbonation readily visible, along with a frothy white head that dissipates slowly to a thin lacing that is retained. 4/5 The aroma is quite yeasty with the yeast esters really coming out strongly. White stone fruit, typical Belgian spices, banana, clove, and coriander really come out nicely along with an undertone of earthy hops. 4/5 The flavor is very typical of Belgian style beers in that it is spicy with banana, clove, and white pepper making their appearances. Along with these, notes of light caramel, yeast, white bread, and earthy hops all come out in a layered style. The booziness comes out quite strong initially but then diminishes over time. Bitterness is light and does not linger after swallowing. Although, the yeasty esters really stay around for quite some time. 4/5 A light carbonation burn (although not as much as expected) hits the tongue straight away, with the beer proceeding to then showcase its medium body and wet/coating nature. There is very little dryness and this dryness does not linger. 4/5 This is a very well layered beer that is surprisingly strong in terms of banana and clove for a tripel. The booziness is quite high, as expected, but it is not muted or hidden like many tripels attempt. Very good tripel here and would gladly come back to this one. 4/5

Seriously, this is everything I look for in a beer. For being a Tripel, this could very much be a table beer, no matter the ABV, because of it's smooth drinkability, smoothness on the palette and just overall beer goodness. If this is the End of the World, then sign me the hell up because this is where I want base camp.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 A 750ml corked and caged bottle with a best before date of 24th July 2017. Poured into a Chimay goblet glass.    Appearance: A hazy golden orange colour with a one finger white head that settled to a nice creamy layer and left nice curtain lacing.    Aroma: Juicy orange and mango, biscuity malt with touches of honey and banana.    Taste: Biscuity, banana, honey and orange with a hint of peach. Clove and light peppery spice on the finish.    Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium bodied with moderate to low carbonation.    Overall: The citrusy orange was just coming on a bit too strong at times for me. Other than that, it was nice.

S- Sweetness of ripe oranges and mangos, wheat. grassy herbs, vodka warmness  T- More orange/mango sweetness with a hint of spice and strong alcohol warmness in the finish. Also bell peppers.  M- Very light and smooth considering the high ABV (Unibroue is really good at that), I could drink this all day.  O- I quite like this beer although i due find it to be bit too sweet, It would due well with a stronger spice taste on the finish   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5 Pours a lovely hazy gold with a big solid white head that lasts, but with little lacing. Cider-like aromas meld perfectly with doughy yeast, honey, rosemary, and a faint maltiness. Remarkably balanced flavors that largely follow the nose. Well carbonated. Overall I would say this is my favorite beer, especially during the colder months. It brings the taste of Belgium to New England AND FOR ONLY $6.50/750ml bottle!    95/100    EDIT (11/23/17):  Since last review, I've had this about once every three months and every time it's a winner. Doesn't matter the season, doesn't matter the event, this beer is always worth the money. Mouthfeel is a little more prickly and carbonated that I remember it being (current rating reflects that), but I think that's mostly because I've tried many other bottle-conditioned beers in the interim.     94/100

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours a straw - cloudy golden color with a nice three finger head. Aroma is spot on - tons of spice, dark orange, sweet yeasty malt goodness. Taste is incredible for the style. Coriander, cinnamon, plum/apple, candy sugar, and that patented Unibroue yeast with a touch of warm alcohol. IMO this is a strong contender with St. Bernardus Tripel. Everything comes together for this perfect Belgium triple. It's best consumed at 50 degrees - so let it warm a bit if it's been in the fridge with your other stash of beers. If you dig Belgiums - your life is not complete if you don't try this offering from Unibroue.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Simply one of the best Tripels made in North America... Or anywhere. The other reviews here are plentiful so I won't pontificate. I just had to chime in!   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a hazy deep gold, variably producing 3-4+ fingers of a moderately lasting, billowy, white, head that leaves only a scattering of lacey strings & motes. Aroma is Unibroue Belgian yeast notes of spice, fruity esters of apple, pear, apricot, banana & clove with notes of candied fruit, honey, coriander & alcohol. Taste is similar to the nose but sweet with more aggressive fruity esters. Spicy pepper, coriander & clove throughout the sip. Buttery, peppery & fruity with alcohol warmth & spice in the finish & aftertaste. As is typical the alcohol intensifies as the brew warms. Very nice but slightly variable from one purchase to another.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip.    Appearance: Hazy gold. Humongous white head.     Aroma: Sugars, citrus, clove, spice.    Taste: Citrus rind, banana, apple, candied sugar, booze. Apricot, pear, too.    Mouthfeel: Pretty boozy but not unapproachable.    Overall: Good representation of the style. Doesn't blow my mind like I expected, but a good example of what a tripel should be.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3 Looks like pineapple juice, with a nice haze and a golden glow. 4 fingers of head, soapy lace left behind.     Aroma of citrus, yeast, and clove. Mild hay and Belgian spices. Mandarin orange.     Holy cloy. Some sickly sweet flavors of banana extract, apple, citrus...it all tastes like extract though. Hot flavors of alcohol and hay, and more extract. Did I get a bad bottle?    Feel is hot and carbonated, with a good dose of creaminess. Hot and dry finish.     Overall...I don't get it. This was way too sweet, artificial, and gross for me.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a 12 oz Longneck into a tulip glass. a slightly hazy, golden ale, topped by a thick, pillow-y two finger head that falls quite slowly to a lovely film. Lacing is excellent    Nosing brings aromas of biscuit-y malt, fruits (banana, citrus rind) along with the coriander and white pepper tones you'd expect from a Tripel.    This one is very complex on the palate- notes of cracker-like malt come right at you, along with honey, sour apple, caramel, and ripe banana lingering all the way through on the tongue. Spice (clove and pepper especially) comes in a bit after, carrying through to a lingering, tartly dry finish with some woodiness and herbal hop notes (perhaps a bit more hops than I'd expect of a Belgian Tripel.)    Mouth-feel is medium, smooth, creamy, very drinkable. Carbonation is brisk and tingly. Alcohol, even a hefty 9%, is nigh undetectable.    I can't say this is the BEST Tripel out there (after all, I haven't tried them all) but I feel confident in saying it's up on the list- way up- and is definitely the best one I've tried that isn't from the style's homeland. In fact, it's better than most of those... a smooth, drinkable body, excellent nose, and wonderfully complex flavors show the high level of craft that has gone into this, as good as any Abbey brewers could hope for. A masterwork.

Effervescent four-inch head with lots of lacing.    Aroma is dominated by spicy and slightly green stone-fruit yeast esters. Beautiful.    Spicy yeast is the first thing to hit me and lingers throughout each sip. The flavour has lots of fruit. I'm picking up pear and stone fruit (peach and dried apricot). There's an earthy and deeply satisfying over-ripe quality to everything. Nor is there any of the cloying candi sugar sweetness or alcoholic burn you sometimes pick up from tripels in this particular bottle, which has been very well-aged, but I do recall that in fresh bottles of La Fin du Monde in the past.     Prickly carbonation and light mouthfeel. Almost no sensation of alcohol.     What can you say? La Fin du Monde is a world-class tripel, superior to all but a small handful of the well-known Belgian abbeys. I don't drink it very often because the well-hidden booze tends to sneak up on me, but it's always a treat. Highly recommended.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours peachy rose-gold. Three fingers of thick head leave islands of lacing.    Nose is unapologetic with the typical tripel aromas of Belgian yeast, mild orange zest, clove, coriander, honey crackers, white pepper, butter, nutmeg, and some sour pear. Partially subdued on the tongue by prominent medicinal phenols, but it does manage to carry much of the nose's promised complexity without any one flavour jumping out to mask the others. This improves vastly as it warms.    Very sweet, very cohesive, oh so drinkable. This is helped along by the mouthfeel - perfectly balanced between medium body, pillowy carbonation, gingery warmth on the breath.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 A beautiful, opaque, mysterious gold. 2-3 inch off-white head with fine bubbles. Solid head retention.     Aroma is quite complex. Start relatively modest (emphasis on "relatively," using this same beer as a point of reference) then explodes. We've got grainy malt, a slight spice that evolves into white pepper, earthy and herbal hop tones, light pome fruit esters (pear is what I get the most on the nose), perhaps a touch of pineapple, and a very small trace of loose-leaf paper. Very interesting, you get something new with each whiff.    First sip... blast-off! Malt is grainy, bagel-like, and a touch toasty. Medium-high in intensity. Earthy, woodsy hops may be there- but some other flavors are winning the battle for prominence. There is the tasty malt, which dances with spiciness and fruit. Pome fruit esters follow the nose- notably a kind of apple tartness, and mellow pear. Each sip is followed by a wonderful aftertaste of spicy white pepper. Quite a mix.     Perfect mouthfeel. Medium body with good carbonation. Zippy throughout. Warming throughout. All of this enhances the glorious, piquant aftertaste. To reiterate- this beer feels perfect in your mouth. Best I've yet had.     I feel this is a beer I will love more and more each time I return to it. An experience!

Smell was deceiving; expected more of a hops flavor but there was none. Nice aftertaste; almost citrusy. VERY drinkable. Would try to find but Ryan explained I may have trouble.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Appearance: golden straw and apricot colors. What the heck, it's the same as all of the other reviews.    Smell: REALLY good. Great, even. I have pretty poor taste buds, therefore my sense of smell isn't as good as most reviewers apparently, but I know what I like. This is damn good. I'd have 3 in a row if I could afford them. Not worth a utility payment.     Taste: I sure wish I could taste those esters of banana and alcohol lingering at the back of the palate, the pepper and the spice and the citrus. Well I CAN taste the citrus, it's kind of a cross between grapefruit and lime... subtle.     Nothing about mangoes however. It's not like we went to a Whole Foods Market or a fresh fruit stand in Africa. We are drinking beer for God's sake. It tastes like beer and smells like beer but it's one of the best I've ever tasted. There's kind of a funky "curl" feel/taste at the back of each sip that kind of reminds me of wee Scotch ale. It's awesome. I don't know what that is. Maybe someone can elucidate. My coarse taste buds don't give me a visual, so to speak.    Sorry I can't add detail to that. My taste buds are screwed. Sorely lacking. And I'm going to say a version of that statement in pretty much every review I do. I feel inferior in some intrinsic physical way to those who can taste nuances.    Feel: Medium-thick, but of course it's a liquid so it's not that thick. It's not like a smoothie or something. Anyway I think people who drink beer will know what I mean. People who only drink smoothies won't. Sorry dudes, you need to drink some beer to check it out.    Overall: this is an incredibly drinkable beer, complex flavors that I cannot begin to describe even though I'm a word guy. Therefore that tells me my taste buds are screwed and I can't taste things as intensely as many reviewing here. But it's complex and dry but sweetish--but not overpowering sweet-- and citrusy and high alcohol which I totally appreciate! Loooove a buzz! Compared to a Bell's Oberon (not this style, I know), which has way too much bitterness-to-sweetness ratio, it strikes the right balance.    Awesome brew! There might be some things that could be done to make it a five out of five but I could not begin to describe what those are. I can sense them just out of the range of my perception however. Sorry Alstrom Brothers, I can't match your 5 out of 5.

Pillowy head standing an inch tall, retention leaves a solid layer of foam and just a lick of lace. Aroma is soft, very floral, fruity and herbal. I'd imagine this is what the first day of spring should smell like in a bottle. Almost too good for words.    Taste has a fantastic malty, baked bread, yeasty, straw flavour that lays the foundation for the fruity goodness. Apple, pear, nectarine, white grape, banana. Clove, nutmeg, coriander and a hint of ginger give this one a harvest-like feel. Would make for a fantastic holiday brew. Very floral and earthy in the finish. Smooth, creamy and clean. ABV undetectable. What a brew.

Appearance: Hazy, bright gold with a lush, frothy head of white foam; streaky lace.    Smell: Tree fruit, cloves, white pepper and alcoholic esters.    Taste: Warm, smooth, malty body with layers of spicy yeast, cloves, pepper, citrus and lightly balancing hop bitterness.    Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth with fine, champagne carbonation.    Overall: Complex and intense while so well balanced and drinkable. First enjoyed almost 20 years ago - still excellent.

It poured a hazy golden color with a multi sized bubble two finger head which very slowly dissipated leaving some very nice lacing. In the nose I detected some light nectarine aroma and possibly a bit of lilac. On the palate the carbonation was lively and crisp. In spit of the higher ABV it did not taste boozy to me. There was even a subtle sweetness on the back end. This is definitely one that will find itself in my regular rotation.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Drank out of a plastic cup in Parc LaFontaine, Montreal:    Appearance: hazy, effervescent orange color, with a massively puffy white head. Carbonation clearly visible, with the head rising, not dissipating for a few minutes after pouring.     Aroma: light spice of coriander and some sugary ester, with the yeast being the most prominent aroma here. Little bit of pear and banana perhaps. Either way, a very lovely scent and a light-smelling sweetness all around.    Taste: for a tripel, very light, with subtle fruit flavors all around. Not dark plum and Cherry flavors like you'd get of some traditional tripels, but banana, yeast, and honey. Sweet and malty.    Feel: full-bodied, but also moderate to high carbonation. Drinks incredibly smoothly for a 9% brew.    Overall: a lovely, delicious tripel with tons of complexity.

A good amount of lacing and super effervescent. You could see carbonation bubbles lining the bottom half of the glass.    Smell - Belgian yeast, pear, coriander; very crisp and complex.    Taste - dry pear and coriander, some bready yeastiness, apple skin tartness.    Feel - a dry finish, very effervescent, but I would like more fluffiness in the body (maybe this is due to age).    Overall, a fantastic tripel that ages well (I bought this old bottle in a mix 6 at a grocery store so I didn't age it myself). I'll be picking up a fresher bottle to see how it differs.

With it's 9.0% ABV, this beer doesn't feel like a strong beer.     The taste has its own distinctive taste and I like this particular taste. It is part of the taste I like from Unibroue.    The way you open the big bottle is also interesting.    I have enjoyed this one since the beginning, and will probably continue to do so.    Way to go Unibroue.

The white head is thick and fluffy, standing tall but not leaving a whole lot of lacing. After a short while of drinking the head eventually fades out to a short cap.    Aroma: It has the sweet smell of coriander. I don't pick up anything else but the aroma is lovely.    Taste: The flavor of this beer is fantastic. It has a light sweet flavor that is almost like eating pears. I can taste the sweet coriander flavor and there is just a touch of tang but not like a fruity tang that some Belgian yeast has. The beer has very clean flavors.    Mouthfeel: Light bodied and effervescent. The finish is off-dry. It is a very enjoyable and easy drinking beer.    Overall: It is a highly enjoyable tripel. If you enjoy a tripel that includes coriander then I would recommend this to you. It is a bit on the sweeter side but it didn't impede drinkability for me. I normally prefer a drier finishing tripel but again this beer just worked very well as a complete package and I found it very enjoyable. I would certainly buy it again.

The title is cheeky but I like cheeky metal so tried this out. The head is ridiculous, billowy, never ending. You just gotta dive into that foam and look like an ass while drinking it, white foam clinging to your beard like Trots to the labour theory of value after the fall of the USSR. It's a great a beer, but a bit too sweet for my liking. Still recommended.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.25 | overall: 2.75 Pours yellow, lots of haze. Pillowy, 1" head with great retention and lace. Aroma was metallic and boozy, I really did not enjoy it.     Taste, more boozy-ness, has a lot of yeast and spice rack to it. Some mixture of green apple, band aids, formaldehyde, vanilla, Sephora in the mall. Coats the mouth with flavors I'm not into. Relatively thin body that packs tons of flavor and alcohol heat into it.     I don't get it.

Two fingers that slowly dissipates down to a half finger white foamy head with thick frothy lacing along the glass. Very nice head retention overall.    Smell has aromas of belgian yeast, lemon zest, honey, fresh cut flowers and undertones of a pleasant spice and pepper.     Taste follows the nose with a pleasant mild yeast flavor coming through initially followed by notes of lemon zest and honey. Finish has some spice, clove, and pepper that balances the mild sweetness from the notes of honey. Hops provide a nice floral character to the beer with some mild bitterness on the finish. Really wonderful example of the tripel golden ale. Flavor hides the ABV (9%) dangerously well.     Feel is smooth and creamy. Dry finish makes for a very nice segue into the next sip. Medium carbonation gives the beer a effervescent champaign like feel.     Overall just an outstanding beer. Great example of the style (tripel style golden ale) and great beer on its own.

Tall, creamy head retains for a substantial amount of time and leaves behind heavy lacing. Beer is golden yellow, almost completely opaque.     Smell is powerful banana and cloves, sweet and not boozy or hoppy at all.    Taste follows nose. Malt is prominent with no hop bitterness, and a subtle gingerbread lingers. Alcohol taste is not present.     The beer is very smooth with a light carbonation that lingers on the tongue. Medium body.    Overall, a very good, refreshing beer. Sweeter than Tripels like Chimay White, but not cloyingly sweet.

Some graham cracker malts. Apples, pears, and citrus fruits. A slight mustiness.    Pours hazy gold with a frothy white head. Good lacing and retention.    Sweet juicy fruit upfront. Pears, fresh apples, bubblegum. Bitterness increases with subsequent sips. Spicy noble-like hops. Honey sweetness. Lots of esters, but some clove and white pepper as well. Very fruit forward. Somewhat sweet.    Medium body, high carbonation. Somewhat silky on the palate, but with lots of tingling bubbles.    More fruit and malt character, less spice as compared to some of my favorite Belgian Tripels, but not a real reason to fault it.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Best by Oct. of 2017  This is clearly one of the best Belgian-style trippels.  Hazy light orange color. Nice head that dissipates quickly leaving a nice web on the glass.  Slight sweet citrus up front (or is that peachy?) with a hint of banana.  Mid is a light spice with a mild sweetness.  Finishes with a balanced malty spice.  Great balance between the alcohol content and the sweetness. Just enough hoppiness.  This one wants to be consumed while sitting at a tavern in front of a large stone fireplace contemplating the meaning of anything.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Wonderful packaging, to start off with, the silver foil topper is a great touch on an already nice bottle.    Pours out with a heavy head that slowly dies down after around 4-5 minutes, leaving a thin foam on a rich straw yellow body. Smells citrus and spicy, hints of coriander and citrus zest dominate.    The taste reflects the smell well, sharp citrus zing with a strong toasted spice undertone, finishing surprisingly light. As other reviews have noted it definitely changes with temperature, acquiring a slightly more bitter edge as it warms, and a thinner mouth feel. Not bad, just a distinct change from it served around 10-12C.    Overall a delicious tripel, expressing layers of flavor as you drink, many more and more complex than commonly seen. Very worthy of it's rating, and as I found it for $1.60, a fantastic deal too.

The province of Québec with the headline/title "The End of the World''... sounds promising.    And it is! This strong Tripel (9%ABV) as pointed out by previous reviewers is drinkable as hell so watch your step if you're out in Montréal on a winters night. I've had better, yet it would definitely be one of my beer of choice if I wasn't living so far away from the place. Santé !

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 The beer pours an extremely light, hazy copper with a pure white head that is about two finger widths that leaves ample Belgian lacing.    The aroma is yeasty with hints of citrus and banana. There is a mild hint of cloves.    The initial taste is sweet with the citrus hitting the tongue right away. In the middle the beer changes little except that the sweetness becomes more evenly balanced with earthy tones. The beer finishes with the a hint of banana and clove mixed in with a light maltiness.    The mouthfeel of this beer is crisp, light and refreshing.    Overall this is a really good triple. It is so light and subtle that you will not notice the 9% abv! A nice light refreshing beer that is perfect for the summer.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Look- hazy drab orange, clear and deep with magnificent bubbles when pouring, just the right about of head on top.     Smell- distinct, direct but light with smooth spices    Taste- Fresh, hints of coriander suttel spices that tie together with ease    Feel- Light, but fills the pallet with a gigantic taste but not overpowering, feels rich initially but then sits well, lushes.     Overall- Tastes like a beer I'd want to have a conversation with, a stranger, but feels like I've known you my whole life. Well traveled but not full of it self. Very interesting personality, has a lot to know and understand but doesn't throw it all at you right away.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 5 Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip. It has a best by date of 10-15-18.    Look -- Poured a hazy straw with three fingers of creamy head that quickly settled. It head coats the sides of the class before gravity turns it into webbing.    Smell -- Strong banana and clove with hints of bubblegum. There is a malty breadiness and some lemony tartness coming through.    Taste -- Nice hoppy bitterness join the characteristics of the nose along with a warming alcohol that peeks through.    Feel -- Nice carbonation balance with the medium body and keeps it from coat or clinging.    Overall -- A fantastic tripel. If you like those Belgian yeast estery qualities and want something that packs a punch alcohol wise you should give it a try.

Smells of dried candied fruit, peppery cloves and herbs, lemon zest, mild soft banana and wildflowers.    Tastes of more sugary dried fruit, marmalade, nutty banana bread, honeyed lemonade and spicy yeast.    Feels soft and fluffy. Medium bodied with lively carbonation. Finishes off-sweet.

I suspect this might be what an Imperial Bavarian-style Hefe Weissen might taste like if there was such an animal (and I do like a hefe). Cloudy gold color. Nose is yeast, bread, cloves, a bit of banana, a bit of booze - wonderful, with a taste that follows the nose profile. Nicely carbonated; not as dry as other Tripels I have had recently. Doesn't completely hide the ABV which comes through at the end, but it is smooth and drinkable enough that this on could sneak up on you. World class.

I've had this a few times since 2008 and it never disappoints; I've found some other Unibroue's I like better (Le Terrible, Trois Pistoles), but this is still the one from my 2008 trip to Montreal that I remember.  **

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 One of the best Tripels I have ever tasted. Tried it after reading positive reviews on BA. This is a bottle conditioned ale that (IMHO) needs to be poured like directed on Unibroue's web site; they recommend the yeast be mixed into the beer by gently turning the bottle upside down.  Make sure you pour it into a glass that will not only allow an appreciation of the floral/citrus notes, but that will also accommodate a sizable head. Goes down very smooth, extremely drinkable.  Turned my son-in-law, who was predominately an IPA fan, into someone who has now testing other Belgian ales by having him try this brew.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a bottle dated best by 10-26-18, so i'm drinking it really fresh it would appear. Pours a very bubbly bright white head and a golden lightly carbonated, wheat-beer body. Lacing is webby and sporadic. Smell is kind of like licorice and root beer hard candy, mixed with clove-like spices, but very ale-like and sophisticated, not gimmicky. Wheat-backbone carries the spiced, refreshing, fruity esters down the throat. Pears, maybe I'm just imagining, but this is a really next-level beer that always is peeling back another layer to reveal more interesting and unique attributes. Highly recommended, it's like a unique, spiced wheat beer that hides its alcohol better than anything I've ever tried. It manages to accomplish these things subtletly while maintaining OG wheat beer characteristics, unlike anything I've tried. Cheers!   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Licorice and root beer candies is what the first sip gives me. It reminds me of my childhood, drinking a old soda pop, but cutting the sugar. Grown up and sophisticated. Smells slightly of an earthy root beer plant. That's all I can really say, it hides it's alcohol extremely well. This is a future desert for me when I don't want something sweet.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 At the top of the Tripel category with 2,954 reviews and double the Hads as the Belgian masters, I'm highly unlikely to add much value in a review. I ditto those who favor this ale among Unibroue's fine collection.    But, I also will offer this comment: as the Fin Du Monde warms during the meal, it really becomes two distinct ales, though obviously related. When the food is spicy, the beer cools and calms the palate along the way. (I last had this ale with Thai pad thai.) But with more normal spiced/herbed European food, this tripel complements the food... particularly as the meal finishes. This ale's flavors get stronger as it warms and it boosts this process if you pour the yeast in at end of the bottle.    Interestingly, MJ's 1999 edition gave this 2.5 stars out of 4. (I wonder if this recipe and brewer has improved significantly in two decades... or if MJ missed this noe.) MJ's simple, short reviews (who I could learn from) was: "suggestions of honey and anise.) I interpret the master's reviews as saying: KISS, Keep It Simple & Short.    4/11/16 Tasted again... news flash... The alcohol interferes with the taste of the tomato/basil sauce; really overwhelmed the food at the end. Next time, I'll try this as prelude to the food. As for the 4 pack I just bought, I think I'll store the remaining 3 for the 2018 date and see if it cools off.    9/7/16 True to form, I did not save the rest of the 4 pack for another year... but that is just as good. I had the 4th with a pesto pasta dish and think that the five months did this ale well and the carbonation moderated so the food could stand on its own. Because of all the pepper, don't drink this beer young with mild foods. Let the beer's peppery flavors mellow a few months and pair it with spicier foods. There is good reason why this ale is so popular: great to drink, interesting to pair.    2/5/17 Again, a great dish to pair with tomato and herbal sauces. This bottle had a year left on its BB date and the bubbles were moderated.    6/9/17 Part of the my personal "Best North American Commonly-Available Tripel" taste-off contest that ended in the conclusion that this and Allagash's are in the same league as the best Belgiums; but I'm leaning toward Allagash on the basis of more moderate spicing. But, it really depends on the day's heat and meal.    5/28/18 Memorial Day picnic. For a bottle that had about 18 months left on its BB date (which I regard as this brew's optimum range.) You can't go wrong with Fin Du Monde. Everyone wanted a second bottle.

A complex taste, with the spice, yeast, and fruits from the aroma coming back. High carbonation, which makes this a dangerous beer to open. Alcohol burn is present. This is great! Head and shoulders above other North American tripels like New Belgium's. Worth every penny.

Smell: strong yeast character, fairly split between phenols and esters, with notes of banana, pepper, clove, and pears. wheat and lightly sweet malt. light amount of alcohol.     Taste: opens up opens with a little bit of banana mixing with pear. phenols take over with a good amount of clove and a lesser amount of pepper. malts are nice and sweet, ranging from a pale/pilsner to a little bit of caramel. small amount of alcohol plays in near the end.    Mouthfeel: moderately bodied. easily drinkable but better when enjoyed slowly. small amount of warming and lingering alcohol. light lingering sweetness and yeastiness.    Overall: A top level beer at a killer price and great availability. I don't revisit nearly as much as I should but this is one of the most approachable beers into the wonderful world of Belgian beers. a must try for all beer drinkers.

Smell- typical Belgian tripel  Taste- prob my fav tripel. Nice yeasty finish  Feel- diggin the carbonation on this.   Overall- much more of a quad fan than tripels or dubbels but this is quite simply a very good, well made beer

One of my perennial favorite beers.    Look: Clear, light gold in color. Two fingers of fluffy white head. Lots of lacing.    Smell: Classic tripel smell of banana and Belgian yeast.    Taste: Banana bread, dry finish.    Feel: Bursting with carbonation, I assume because of the bottle fermentation. This actually complements the sweetness of the beer, making it more refreshing. A little too sticky sweet at the end.    Overall: Excellent example of a Belgian tripel, especially for not actually being Belgian.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Hazy golden color, with a small bubbly head. The head has a particularly interesting appearance to me, wherein rather than looking like one singular entity, it looks like it's composed of a large amount of small individual bubbles that just happen to interlock. Anywho, great appearance.    Smells of banana, caramel, Belgian yeast. The fruity aspect of this smell is definitely very present.     The taste is generally quite similar to the smell. Taste is subdued, yet very appealing. Mouthfeel is dry, with high carbonation.     I am not that familiar with the style since earlier, but the few examples I've had (Chimay White etc) have all been disappointing to me. This is not. Very satisfying taste, which is both simple and nuanced at the same time - with a drinkability that makes you forget the 9% ABV. Most excellent!   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I've had this beer many times. Yesterday they were selling fourbacks at the store by our house for $9 and they gave you free samples. It is an excellent Belgian Tripel for a reasonable price. I rated it a long time ago but I did not write a review until now.    Look: cloudy golden hue with a one and a half inch bubbly white head.    Aroma: wheaty, some yeast, banana, and clove.    Taste: Flavor is wheaty and caramel sweet malts, banana, pear, clove, yeast flavor, barely noticeable alcohol, relatively mild yet flavorful.    Feel: medium to full mouthfeel

A nice alcohol burn in the finish. This beer goes down easy and is truly enjoyable to drink.    This is a very tasty tripel. I love Belgian style beers and this is one of my favorites.

So... 8-7-15 poured into a tulip. Cloudy caramel colored w dense off white 1 inch head w great retention. Nose is sweet, dank and old orange peel. Hint of champagne. Taste threw me off because it didn't follow the nose as much as I'd thought it would. I expected more sour and yeast but was surprised by how sweet and mild it was. Leaning towards more mild orange but more of a citrus blend. As it warms I'm feeling the body change from light to medium light. I thought it would be more carbonated. Overall I'm very impressed with this beer. Surprised at how much I'm enjoying it. Cheers.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 To start, let me say I am new to the Belgian style. Color is very pleasant and nose is of malty yeast and lemon.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 Poured from the bomber into a large tulip.  Pours a medium slightly hazy straw color with tons of head and great retention.  Aromas were mild, and plenty yeasty more saison yeast than traditional Belgian IMO.  Flavors were nice yet mild, very drinkable. Mix of yeast and bread flavors, mild notes of spice. Again, very nice but not what I was expecting in a triple.  Mouthfeel was clean and excellent.  Overall this was a good beer but clearly didn't wow me like it does others.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 12oz bottle into pint glass in December 2015. The drink by date on the bottle was 10/10/2017.    Appearance: Dark gold with light tan head. Beer is not cloudy, and very carbonated. Head is almost white and very thick, and leaves a thin film on the glass.    Smell: Aroma filled with mix of malt, a little caramel, and some hops. Also some earthy tones as well. Nice variety and balance.    Taste: There is a nice mix of sweetness and with just a little bite from the hops. There is are citrus flavors, and I get some caramel flavors, some spices, which are balanced with a bit of hops. There is a little alcohol bite as well. This was done in a nice combination with the other flavors. There is a nice variety of flavors in the aftertaste too.    Mouthfeel: Full-bodied. Medium to strong alcohol, which confirms the 9% on the bottle.    This is a smooth full-bodied Tripel, and one of the best Tripels I have tasted. It is an interesting combination of flavors, and I would drink this again.

There was a very fluffy white two finger head that showed traces of unfiltered yeast in the foam. The smell was intriguing with a yeasty zest mixed with some fruity banana or pear and a hint of spiciness. The taste started out with some fruity banana notes again with a heavy yeast that faded into a excellent malt character with just a hint of hops. The feel was almost champagne like with the carbonation dancing on the tongue. This is a wonderful drinkable triple that hides the abv well. Very good beer.

Wow. Aromas are many with yeasty esters, banana, sweet light malt, and apples. Flavors are completely different - a semisweet fruitiness that's fantastically malty. This is delicious. Uh oh.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from cork and cage bottle into pint glass. The cork popped like a champagne cork. The color is a hazy golden amber with a frothy, two-finger head and thick lacing. The smell features coriander, cloves, yeast, and green apple. While I don't taste the apple I smelled, I do taste pear and pineapple, along with cloves. As it warmed, I also tasted the banana that others mention. There's a little hop at the end. It's delicious. This ale is highly carbonated and the 9% ABV really kicks. Nonetheless, it is fun to drink. Overall, Fin du Monde justifies its reputation as an excellent tripel. It's as good as any Belgian-brewed tripel I've had.

When it comes to this brew, it means to venture into unknown lands and taste the creation of experts who are willing to venture beyond the known boundaries of beer.    While firmly rooted in the Belgian tripel style, La Fin du Monde takes this style to new heights. Infusing the brew with a heavy clove and citrusy flavour, the brew is finely balanced between sweet, fruity flavours and a crisp, hoppy kick. A hefty dosing of malts however builds up a thorough base for the rest of the flavours to sit on. If you haven't had one of these before, do not make the mistake of thinking that the fruit flavours are akin to macrobrewed "Apple light" pseudobeers. This is a 100% tripel through and through.    Perfect nose, perfect feel (while highly carbonated, the feel has a noticeable body), incredible smell. Do not drink this fine brew too cold, as the clove and alcohol flavours punch through a little too much at this temperature. Treat it as though it was a dark beer and drink at 8-13 degrees.    In homage to the great explorers who have discovered the new world; in homage of the great nation of Canada -- I raise you a filled glass of Le Fin du Monde. Cheers!

The Belgian trippel is my current favorite thing and this one is set to ruin me... Oh well. The smell, the taste, the feel...all off the charts. I had been looking forward to trying this one for quite some time and I am not in any way disappointed. Wow. Well done and a huge thanks to Unibroue!

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 1st surprise was when I popped the cap off. There was such a force I thought it would gush out. Light gold in color with thick head and lots of carbonation. Aroma is without a doubt what you would expect from this style, malty, hint of spice. Taste is out of this world. Bold flavors of malt, spice, grain but not overpowering, just full of flavor. Goes down too easy considering its bold flavors & strength, this will knock you over if you're not careful. A beer to savor every sip. Perfection.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured into tulip glass.     Appearance: Light hazy golden straw color. Foamy head that dissipates quickly. Delicate lacing.   Smell: Smells sweet of Banana, apricot, peaches, pear ,apple, and sugar. Towards the end it smells strongly of peach.   Taste: Sweet with lots of fruit notes. Banana, apricot, and peach.   Mouthfeel. Crisp and smooth.     I absolutely loved this beer! Really good favors and smells incredible. The alcohol is very well hidden. Gets better and better the more you sip on it. More champagne like than other tripels I've had.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Had to try this one with it's outstanding reviews. I love Tripels with some good carbonation, but this one was really carbonated to the point to tasting a little tinny. Overall a good Tripel and while I'm left wondering if they are as much my style as I've always though - I must conclude that this is the best of the beers I've had out of Canada so far.

I’ve had this more than enough times to say something on this. Here goes and just about every time I’ve had this into a chalice. The appearance was a nice golden amber to somewhat orange color with a nice one finger white foamy head that dissipates within less than a minute. The smell had a super nice allocation of iced apples, coriander, some peaches, and a nice Belgian spicy sort of yeastiness invading my nose. The taste was sweet and spicy and said a lot about a somewhat invading pear-like flavoring over top of the apples I previously smelled. I didn’t get any aftertaste but I did get a dry finish. On the palate, it sat about a light to medium and showed a decent sessionable characteristic about it. The carbonation seemed somewhat smooth but still had a decent sharpness running about it. Overall, in my opinion, this was a good Tripel that I would have again.

Light, and a has a little alcohol smell. Better than most high end Belgium beers. Cannot go wrong with anything from this brewery. Look is straw colored, nice head, can smell the yeast, taste is smooth with citrus notes.

S: banana clove Belgian yeasts   T: awesome ! Really well carbonated . Nice banana and clove from the yeast. Little fruit notes, it don't really love the fruity notes however. Extremely smooth and crisp at the end.   Nothing bad to say about this beer. It's just really good. Good job Canada, thought this was from Belgium!

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 This was poured into a chalice.  The appearance was a moderately hazy golden orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than about a minute. Lacing seemed to spider web nicely.  The smell had Belgian yeast coming across in a slight bready sweetness and spice. Banana, iced apples, a little bit of cherries and a light dose of pears make a nice sweet combination in this one.  The taste took the sweetness of the Belgian yeast and re-branded itself into the flavor as somewhat spicy allowing the previously mentioned fruits to overcome and be the force in the flavor. There's a nice subtle sweet aftertaste of the fruits with a little bit of spice.  The mouthfeel had a medium body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation seems to hit right as I get enough harshness on my tongue but nothing detracting from the flavor.  Overall, hey hey hey, bombs away, a stellar tripel not from Belgium, but of course I'd love another. Now cue R.E.M.'s "its the end of the world" as we know while I go and drink another because if Fat Albert found out about this one, Unibroue might have to up their tank production of this one.

O - This is one of my favorite Belgian style beers, and certainly my favorite Tripel that's not from Belgium.

Overall I can't say much more except that this is a very tasty well done beer par for the style IMO.     Enjoyed on tap during Old Chicago's 2015 Halloween mini tour

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Appearance: Light orange tint filled with a full 1 1/2 inches creamy white head.    Aroma: The fruit and spices (especially) jump out of the glass for such a high ABV brew.    Flavor: Full of pepper with apricots and lighter fruits throughout, almost a green apple hidden in there.    Mouthfeel: Sweet and smooth all the way through, leaves a slight tingling sensation. This is nothing like the devastating mouthfeel of most american tripels that I am used to.    Overall: I can understand the insistence of picking this up as a starter to heavier belgian styles that is widely available. I am not quite sure this is the benchmark on anything and everything a Belgian tripel should be, I will do more research and report back.

Nose takes a minute to figure out. Really beautiful fruity and spicy yeast character, aside a buttery, apricot fruit. Promises of good things to come.    Banana, apricot, clove, even peppery with a nicely sharp tart yeast hit in the middle. Buttery character is there tying it all in. plenty of warming in the back. Nice and smooth, fuzzy fizzy carbonation dances all over.     Classic, complex, rich, balanced. Everything you want in triple - fruit, yeast and spice in perfect harmony.

This beer has a very obvious apricot taste. It is also very sweet.    Can't say that I have ever had a tripel before, but what I can say, is the only reason this beer does not receive a 5 in all categories is that the apricot taste remains with me all night no matter what beers I drink.    This is an absolute must try beer, and deserves every mark that it gets.
