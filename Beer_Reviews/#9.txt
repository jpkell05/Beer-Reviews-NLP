There is nothing really that stands out from this beer but it's still worth a try. I highly recommend it to people that are newbies to craft beer. I am going to assume that they add some actual fruit or at least fruit flavoring to make this beer like some apricots or peaches, but I could be wrong about that assumption. Cheers! C

look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 3 12 Oz Bottle poured into glass  Look - golden orange with some touch of amber. Very small foam head and only minimal glass lacing  Smell - bar none, the strangest beer aroma I have come across. Cherry-apricot bubble gum. Some slight wheat or grains. Very sweet smelling and honestly it smells like a strange fruit cocktail more than a beer...  Taste - It's got a strange taste too. I don't know what's in it so it's hard to describe. It's like a fruity highly carbonated ale. Not saying it's fake but it doesn't taste like fresh hops or anything. Not one single characteristic stands out. It has quite a bit of carbonation. The bitterness is perhaps more than IBU's suggest. It's sweet but its not overwhelming. Drinkable i guess.    Overall, this one is just not my thing. I don't enjoy the taste enough to buy it again. Grade is a B-

Creamy off white head sticks around. Leaves a few spots of lacing.  Aroma is predominately floral and slightly sweet. Grassy, vegetal in the background.  Quite a floral grape emphasis in the flavor, with some minor hop bitterness at the end. Rather dry finish.  Medium thick body. Okay carbonation.  Tastes like a old school craft creation. Comes from the "Magic Hat". Overall, kind of thin in flavor but has that grape floral signature.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Tricky situation, here.  Overall, #9 is a decent beer...but it's definitely old school. I mean, it popped up in the mid nineties, somewhat as a pioneer in the craft beer scene. They did things with beer that no one had ever done, before. Apricot flavored beer? What?   It was different, and stood out in a crowd. Jeez, back then, green bottled imported beer was "fancy," and most people (in the northeast) were just drinking Bud. Beer was beer...all the same...bottles were better than cans...etc, etc.  Then #9 appeared. People were like: what's that?   Fast forward to today, and the flavor trend has shot into the stratosphere...only, the flavor comes from hops....hops that didn't even exist back then. So...cheers to Magic Hat for paving the way..sort of.  Today, there are certainly some fruit puree flavored IPAs out there that sell well...  What I liked was that I found a Can-tastic mixed 12-pk. Let's face it, cans are where it's at, today. Three cheers for the "old man" keeping it "young."  And, anyways, they've been bought and sold a few times...they aren't quite who they used to be.  So, as a beer goes, when you have a #9, you're drinking a pioneer...enjoy it for what it's worth... I do.

Sipping creates a few scattered patches of lacing.    The aromas are slightly malty but heavy on the apricot.    The flavors focus on the apricot and some caramel malt sweetness without much in the way of hops showing even during the ending of the beer.    The mouthfeel medium is bodied and fairly soft with the moderate carbonation.    A drinkable beer but one I'll not be revisiting. While it is tasty and fruity, that's about all it offers.

look: 4 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.25 This is my first review, so I may not use all the correct vernacular, although I read the "How To Review A Beer" thread. This beer is described by the brewer as "Not Quite Pale Ale" and I should have known better than to let the eye catching can fool me. This beer is less than stellar, being of thin body, flabby in flavor, and slightly under-carbonated for my taste. This reminds me of a sweeter version (and by sweeter I do not mean maltier) of a readily available commercial English Pale Ale, a beer I hold in low regard. Oddly, on a positive note, I enjoyed the aftertaste more than the beer itself.

Decent enough, but not to my usual tastes...

Two finger white head that dissipates rapidly to a thin rime. Really pretty lacing.    Mild fruit with hints of apricot and apple.    Tastes bright and clean. No funk at all. Fruit is definitely not the predominant flavor. Thought it would be more fruity. Reminds me of a weak lager except for the lack of hop bite.    Light and refreshing on the palate. Good carbonation. Faint sweet finish.    Overall a nice beer. Very drinkable. Mild is the best word I can think of to describe it.

The nose was intriguing: malty, with apricot and interesting spices. The first thing I tasted was apricot and bready malt with some sweet vanilla or caramel. It's medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. You don't even notice the 5.1% ABV. Honestly, I expected a little more from Magic Hat. It was okay to drink with burgers and hot dogs but I wouldn't seek it out.

look: 2.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Look - Pours a clear light copper color with a thin and crackly white head that dissolves immediately.  Aroma - Apple cider, grains, sourdough bread.  Taste - Fruity up front, juicy apricot, syrupy sweet, a faint hint of caramel, thin malt towards the end with a tart aftertaste.  Feel - Light-Medium bodied, tart, ample carbonation, refreshing.    Overall - Dude I don't even know.

A: pours a slightly hazed orange copper with 1 finger beige head and loads of streaming carbonation. Very nice lacing and pretty good retention.    S: a little bready caramel. Vague fruit. That vague fruit grows more prominent as it warms and becomes cloying and awful.    T: there is something off here. Arrives with an immediate medicinal fruitiness. Bready and ever so slightly citric middle turns to a refreshing but weird end, which leaves a disgusting artificial cough syrup aftertaste.    M: mid bodied, high carbonation, and pretty clean.     O: I seem to recall having had this a couple of times about a decade ago and liked it, or at least thought it was okay. I am going to assume this can is a year and a half old. This was unqualifiedly awful.

Looks typical clear amber poured into a pint with a standard thumbs width of foam. Smells good to me, light and floral. Would probably breach the cusp of cloy if the beer had more character, but it knows it's limits and settles well into average and drinkable.     Likewise taste is interesting without being adventurous. It hints at an interesting concept but chooses to suggest instead of delivering. Probably for the best, as I could see this idea turning into a nasty end product.     As is, I'd actually recommend this if it showed up on your doorstep. Very drinkable. Light, smooth and not overpowering. Standard.

Poured golden to light copper color with a 3/4 inch head that dissipated fairly quickly leaving significant lacing. Nose: just a hint of apricot/pear; palate: like a lager, but again with fruity notes, especially on the back end of swallowing. Light body and mouthfeel. Refreshing, if not very complex. Probably good for the beach.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 This Beer confused me, mainly because it was listed under the hoppy/floral category at the Yardhouse Vegas. So I was expecting a IPA-APA. This turned out to be a fruit beer. Lots of peach and mango on the nose and taste. Reminded me a lot of Samuel Smiths Organic Apricot. Had a sort of peach nectar feel and taste to it. Had I looked it up on beer advocate first I would have known what I was getting. It was okay just a bit to sweet for me.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 L: Amber with little head  S: A lot of apricot, as expected  T: Sweet and a bit medicinal. Not a huge fan.  F: Nice and crisp  O: I feel like this is a very nice pale ale that someone accidentally spilled a bunch of apricot syrup in. I'm not opposed to fruit-augmented beer in principle, but this one is a bit of a mess. There just isn't enough beer to keep up with the apricot, so it ends up tasting like a bad malt soda. A brew of historical interest for New Englanders, it's not really worth much on its own merit.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 2 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.5 Pours an amber / dark golden color with minimal head. Smells of fruit and malt. Taste is fruity up front with hints of apricot and tangerine, then it gets a bit medicinal and that taste just won't let go for me. Very mild hops throughout. I'm not a hop-head, but the medicinal or artificial taste kills this one for me. Probably will not buy again.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 12 oz bottle. Pours amber with a one finger white head. Aroma of citrus, slightly floral, and a bit of Belgian funk. Taste is sweet, citrus, honey. Light to medium body.

I think this is more complex than some people think and yet easy drinking. Pretty good I think.

Great packaging though! But to make sure the purchase wasn't a total loss, I'm reviewing #9. I note that North American Breweries lists Rochester (Genesee) as a second production location now. They can produce decent beer at Genesee. As evidence, some good Blue Point beers were contract brewed there until the ABInbev takeover.     Aroma is not bad, a slight fruity nose. Taste has some poorly defined fruity character on top of a pretty good basic beer base. I think I need a "Heart of Darkness" chaser.

If the label leads you to believe that it is a pale ale and you infer that it is an APA, you'll probably be disappointed. Faint aroma of apricot and not much else.

O: The sweet fruity flavor is pleasant, and I could see this as a good summer session fruit beer. However, I wish there was more character to the flavor, then just a generic form of sweet.

Taste - I happen to love fruit beer. I drink so many heavy styles, Fruit beer and IPA are my light mellow, and hot weather choices and this beer is probably my favorite of these outside of the one time or limited releases without my local feel. Apricot forward and malty back. Yummy.  Feel. Least important to me as long as it's not offensive, I can't honestly rate this but I feel lame drinking this thus my rating. Other than that note Feel like a filtered beer on the unfiltered side of scale and I am not a filtered beer guy or pasteurized beer one.

Semi-transparent orange hued amber with a one finger head that lingers and doesn't leave lacing. Nose of dark fruit and citrus hops. Taste follows the nose with a weird semi-sweet fruit and slightly bitter finish. Medium body and medium carbonation with a weird aftertaste.  A fruit influenced pale ale is the best way to describe it. It feels half done to me but it's definitely a good gateway craft beer. Not a bad fallback option on disappointing beer menus since it's more interesting than a Boulevard Wheat.

I can tell it's beer, but barely.  T (3.75) - A bit of general maltiness, more like a bread/cracker. But not a lot here. There probably shouldn't be a whole lot of flavor, but I need a little more.  F (3.5) - Fairly light bodied, under-carbed, beer.   O (3.75) - I had this beer years ago, and finally had it again after being on BA. We don't get it in our area, so I got some. It's okay, and I can see how non BA's might like it. But it's just okay. I also disagree with their classification of it, but I guess I don't really know how they brew it.

Very clear and effervescent.    Smell- Lightly toasted grain, hints of peach, light floral scent.    Taste- Grainy dry malt with a light fruit sweetness of peach or pear flavor. Crackery bread-like flavor mixes in. Has almost like a cider like finish.    MOuthfeel- Medium to thin in body with active carbonation.    Overall- Drinkable and alright but a bit lacking on the flavor. Could use a bit more flavoring. I'd barely consider this a fruit beer.

I will not repurchase.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 Billed as an unusual, mysterious beer in 1995, it might have been worthy of a time capsule as representative of how the second generation of craft brewers were pushing the envelope by adding fruit to enhance refreshment.    To its credit, #9 does pose a mystery: it is apricot fruity throughout, yet gets dry at the end... albeit not a pleasant one.   Rather than never have #9 again, I tried again with a pineapple salsa. It gives the ale more purpose, but not redemption.    #9 was on the "1001" list printed in 2010. Brewing has progressed greatly in six years. If #9 deserved to be on the list then, it is improbable to be on the list today.

Balanced, doesn't crash the palate.. Likely enjoyed most by consumers who enjoy a mildly Apricot scented ale. Definitely suitable for the IPA fan and not for the higher calorie beer enthusiast on the lookout for a bold flavor.  If you are a Quad fan..or even a Hefeweizen fan, then this beer may just be a palate cleanser. If you like pale ales, then go for it as I see no reason for this beer to disappoint the category it represents.

look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 1.25 | feel: 1.25 | overall: 2 Poured a golden yellow with a wisp of a head that lasted 25 seconds (I counted) followed by a few sad dabs of lacing. Carbonation lasted a minute more resulting in an almost nasty flat mess of a beer with a bitter aftertaste. Kind of like an old Corona with a bit more color and, yes, a slightly peachy aroma. Magic Hat says "A beer cloaked in secrecy. An ale whose mysterious and unusual palate will swirl across your tongue and ask more questions than it answers." Like why did I buy this $10 bucks a sixer disappointment?  Yes there's worse out there, but not too many at this price. Luckily I had a Keystone Ice to cleanse my palate. What does that tell you?

Lots of streaming carbonation    Smell was of sweet malts with a pinch of fruity notes with a prevalent smell of peaches as the beer warmed.    Taste followed the nose with a touch of fruity malts. The sweetness was very balanced with the malts and just a touch of hops that provided that great hops and malt balance.    Mouth feel was a bit towards the medium side with each drink feeling like a bite of fruit followed by a nice clean finish.   
look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pours an clear gold with only the slightest bit of haze. could just be how i poured it but it didn't form much of a head. Smells musty and malty with very faint fruit tones lingering. Tastes pretty good, like the smell only with a lot more going on that is a little hard to capture; every sip is somewhat of an adventure. Not a hop bomb but still has flavor enough to keep you interested. I could easily sit through a few of these before wanting to move on to something else. Mouthfeel is very easy, carbonated enough to tingle the tongue but light bodied enough for one to want to let it sit on the tongue for a minute so as to capture the full range of flavors. Good, sessionable, interesting.

Smell - very distinct. Once you've had this beer you won't ever confuse another beer with it. Various fruits really stand out when smelling it as well as stronger hoppy notes.    Taste - You're either going to really like it or not like it at all. Once again, hints of various fruits all throughout each drink without being overly fruity. The bitter hops are present but nowhere near as bitter or have as much bite as your basic IPA.     Feel - not much different than any other IPA in this category. Carbonation seems to stick with it until the end but it's not annoying. Lighter, definitely refreshing.    I personally wouldn't want to drink too many of these in one sitting. The taste may wear out its welcome to some people and spoil any future #9 purchases, while others will fall in love with it immediately and never look back. Definitely worth a shot, though, if you're wanting to try something a little out of the ordinary. I wasn't sold at first, but on second try a couple years later I became hooked.

Nice hoppy/fruity/citrus aroma with a hint of sweetness. Reasonable mouth feel for the pale ale style. Odd malt or fruit initial taste that transitions to a sweet aricot with a very slight bitterness with the fruit sweetness lingering on the tongue. This beer is interesting, at least, and hardly ordinary. It is enjoyable enough to finish the 6-pack over a few days, but not enjoyable enough that I will buy it again. Even though it is easy drinking at first, it begins to wear out its welcome; I couldn't have more than 2 at a sitting.

I don't even know how to say that this didn't taste like beer, tasted like ax body spray for women. I can't take anything away taste or mouthfeel wise that resembles a beer.

The smell is very fruity, tangerine, apricot, pears, maybe apple. There is also a grassy, grainy smell.    The taste follows the nose with the fruit dominating from beginning to end. There is a light biscuit malt backbone with a dry, champagne like finish. Sweet from beginning to end.    Overall, this is a fruit beer that I believe I can drink in a session without getting put off the sweetness.

Pours slightly hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of apricot, peach, plum, pear, apple, honey, toasted biscuit, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of apricot, bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of apricot, peach, plum, pear, apple, honey, toasted biscuit, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of apricot, peach, plum, honey, toasted biscuit, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness, complexity, and balance of apricot, bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavor; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5.1%. Overall this is a very good fruited English pale ale style. All around good robustness, complexity, and balance of apricot, bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth, clean, and easy to drink. The aromas were stronger on the apricot notes, but still had a good amount in the flavor; and the base English pale ale is very well done for the style. A very enjoyable offering.

This was poured into a pint glass.  The appearance was a hazy burnt purple to ruddy brown color with a quickly dissipating fizzy head with no lacing, well, okay then, be that way, I'm trying to be fair here, easy there Tonto, no need to just die out and show me entertainment.  The smell, well, there's some burnt sugars, raisins, and overly baked bread (wants to seem like its burnt?!?!).  The taste was semi-sweet with that burnt bready to overly cooked fruits. Weird aftertaste.  The mouthfeel was about light bodied. Sessionability, hmmm...weird flavor and aftertaste makes it not seem so much.  Overall, do I have to go on? Well, I gave it a fair shot and am now thinking the joke's on me and my wallet for paying for this swill. Oh damn, look at that, my toilet just barfed it up.

Now that my pallet has refined a bit and I've had many world class beers since then, this beer is no more then average to me. I still respect it and like it's unusual flavor but I think this is my last. 3.25

The head is 3 fingers tall, popcorn yellow, and leaves giant fluffy lace as it recedes to a finger.     Smell : Apples, pears, a slight sour berry note, and some grains behind that. No hop presence. Nice, fruity, floral.    Taste : A little washed out with pale malts and hints of pear, banana, and sliced apple. A nice oaty cereal grain finish as well. Lingering notes of marshmallow, peaches w/ cottage cheese. I think it's delicious.    Feel : Super easy to drink, light bodied and refreshing. Crisp all the way to the bank.     Overall : I'd buy more of this. I liked it, others hate it...the only way to know is to try it for yourself.

The flavor is odd, with an open of a fairly typical APA, hops with a bit of bread from the malts, but the close is fruit notes. Unfortunately, what is not clear is the nature of the fruit. The sweetness is undifferentiated, and not particularly distinctive. The feel is fairly clean, but not "crisp." I like a solid fruit-based beer, but this lacked clarity, and was fairly disappointing overall.

S: Artificial fruit, light spice, Blue Moon but weaker    T: Artificial citrus, apricot, spice, then Robitussin after it sits for a while    M: Sticky, unpleasant, much like a past-prime Hefeweizen     O: Purchased because of word of mouth/Rochester on the label.

Aroma was weird, yet inviting fruitiness and a faint malt aspect to it.     Holy crap, now it seems like I'm drinking some artificial laboratory perfume animal tested whatnot. Fuck is this axe body spray? Drinking this is now a chore.     Mouthfeel sucks too. Fruit beers have their place, but when it comes to liquid hitting the lips, this doesn't come off like fruit, much less a fruit beer I would ever want to have again.

If this was pourn into a glass without me knowing what it was I would be turned off by the color. But for its darker look it has a surprisingly good taste. It reminds me of a darker, less sweet Blue Moon. Would recommend trying but it's not something I'll go out if my way to get again.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 The tint is a Texas burnt orange, but it looks lighter than that because of the clarity. There isn't much head, but it sticks around. The smell is oddly, umm, nonexistent? Perhaps the faintest touch of fruit. There is much more there in the taste. The initial taste is of a light, sweet fruit. Perhaps apricot? (P.S.: not a fruit guy.) Then, there is a light, balanced hoppiness that carries through to the finish, without eliminating the fruit sweetness. The mouthfeel is nice. Crisp, and doesn't linger or get slick as beers with sweet flavors sometimes can. Decent, though not something I'd seek out.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3 The first thing that hit me with this beer was an artificial/candy-like taste lurking under some other indescribable flavors. So I looked down the list of recent reviews and grabbed these descriptors that I agree with:  Creamy  thin  apricot  pear  peach  squash  apple  candy  mandarin orange  pound cakey  fake berries (fruity pebbles) and down the line got more prunes  aromas of freshly baked sourdough bread  Smooth and creamy through the middle with a slow building drying sensation toward the end  caramel  no hops  weird    The drawback is that these aromas feel artificial.  I do recommend using this to marinade chicken with.

Poured a standard pills/IPA gold, decent foam head reduced quickly to tight lacing. Smell is clean, not overly hoppy. Mouthfeel is slightly carbonated. Taste is ok, not bad at all, but nothing really stands out to make it interesting. It's very drinkable, probably because there is nothing really to it. Slight grain, slight hops, yeast is neutral and clean. It just needs... more. Not sure more of what, but more of something, anything, to appear less "average".

Small amount of lacing that slid down the sides of the mug to rejoin the the thin head.    S: light smell a bit citrusy. As it sat and warmed a bit moved to a more fruit like smell. A very little of a hop smell.    T: light hop taste with some bitter on the backend.     F: lightly carbonated bite on the tongue and mouth. Has a dry feel in the aftertaste.

Taste is similar. A bit flowery and maybe a hint of corriander and a bit of earthiness. As it warms, I pick up a bit of a vegetal flavor. Very little bitter.  Mouthfeel is on the thin side and well-carbonated.  Overall, weird but not unpleasant and somewhat refreshing.   
look: 3 | smell: 2 | taste: 2 | feel: 1.5 | overall: 2.5 Look: Light Amber color with 2 finger head of foam upon pour. Poured into 16 ounce pint glass from a bottle. Decent head retention with some lacing. Carbonation evident upon pour with tiny bubbles throughout.     Smell: Yeasty with light apricot tones, contributing a musty scent (I have always thought apricots smell musty, so that's an individual nose thing, not a fault in the beer). Nose opens to stronger apricot-fruit scent as the beer sits.    Taste: Drier than the nose would indicate. Floral notes hit near the end, followed by a touch of bitter. Very malty, almost no hop presence, except for very slight bitterness at the finish.     Feel: Thin, just this side of watery. Pleasant level of carbonation.    Overall: A decent fruit style beer for warmer weather, but nothing I would seek out to drink again. While the aroma opens the longer the beer sits, the taste never changes. Not a bad beer, but in all fairness to Magic Hat, I'm not much of a fruit or vegetable style beer drinker, unless it comes to Dogfish Head Punkin Ale or Southern Tier Pumking.

Sweet and fruity but in a sugary way which I'm not use to in a beer. I don't hate it, nor do I love it but I will order it again until I figure out what taste is hidden in this beer. No head upon pour ... just confusing

Taste:  Semi tart, mild apples and wheat grass and a slight touch of ops, not bad at al.  Mouthfeel:  Light bodied and very crisp  Overall:  Not bad over all, good tasting and well balanced.

The biggest pro was mouthfeel, the carbonation in this beer lends a nice crispness. Very quenching and drinkable. Biggest negative was the nose, due to confusion more than anything. It's like I can place there is some sort of fruit in there but it is not very appealing and for the life of me I could not ID it blindly (believe I heard it was apricot at one time).

look: 3 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.75 A relatively solid Ale, nothing special or robust about the flavor. It pours a deep gold color with a creamy inch of head, some decent lacing retention but not too much, it is very bubbly; almost excessively bubbly for my personal tastes, highly carbonated. As far as the taste goes this is as bland as it gets for me, its not particularly awful or anything but it isn't very good either. Tastes like a champagne or perhaps even a white wine, just very alcoholish tasting. It has a 5.10 ABV but tastes much stronger then that, tastes like a 6 abv brew at least or more to me anyway. On the bright side it has a very creamy texture which I like and it seems to settle down the more you drink it, but the taste never fully improves. It isn't a bad beer by any means, but I certainly wont be buying this again.

Now, as my palette has become more sophisticated, I revisited this old favorite. Needless to say, it's not nearly as good as I remember, but still a great alternative to Sam Adams or Blue Moon if your unfortunate enough to be at Applebees. Still love the words of wisdom under the bottlecap. Today mine was "Milk a cow till it says wow"

S - The aroma appears to be an attempt at a fruit beer yet ends up smelling like bread to me. I'm not quite sure what to make of the aroma. A lingering scent that reminds me of many macro brews.    T - A bitter-tart flavor that isn't too pronounced. Very distinct flavor of apples present. It's not horrible but I feel is more of an acquired taste.    M - Light bodied beer, very crisp. Fairly carbonated; more than my personal liking.    O - An average beer that didn't wow me or anything. I feel would've been better if another fruit instead of apples were used.

I guess that's why I was hesitant to return to this one, but I ended up getting one for free which I could not turn down. I was expecting the worst, but it was better than I expected.   Look was orange in color, hazy(didn't think this was a wheat beer), opaque(kind of like looking through stained glass) The head disapeared into a thin white head that stayed with it all along. There was not much lacing.  Smell is I thought at first like fake berries(fruity pebbles) and down the line got more prunes. It is definitely a sweeter smell.  Taste was fruity, a bit of hops, malty like a scotch ale and then a dry finish. It does remind me of a scotch ale quite a bit.   The body is thin and goes down smooth. Not a ton of carbonation. Since I like scotch ales and I felt like this was comparable it was a decent beer in my opinion. It has a sessionable quality since it is only 5.1% ABV.

I was for some reason expecting it to taste like a typical IPA which I don't like but I was surely mistaken. It goes down so well, tastes of apricots and citrusy fruits, unlike any beer I've ever tasted. I'm not very well at describing beers down to the taste and smell and all that, but it's definitely worth a try. I could now say it's my go-to beer until I find something tastier, I know I'll be picking up larger quantities of this in the future! Definitely not looking forward to this 30 rack after tasting that!

Thin, finely-beaded lacing adorns the glass walls. Modest amounts of carbonation drift lazily to the surface.    Aroma: The aroma offers a surprising note of apricots, and fairly robust pale malt.    Taste: The taste begins with caramel and apricots, not quite caramel dipped apricots, but both flavors are prominent. There is also an underlying bread-like malt flavor. Towards the finish, there is a slight tart and sour flavor, and some mild grassy hops.    Mouth feel: Smooth and soft, with modest carbonation.    Drinkability/notes: Not bad really, would be appealing in the depths of summer.    Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice.

Not much 'beer' aroma- almost like a fruit punch, but enticing.    T: Same fruits, presented very dryly. Finally some banana-like wheat flavor, reminding me that this is actually a beer.    F: Light bodied, thankfully not syrupy from the sugary fruits. Not much texture, but that makes this extremely easily drinkable.    O: Not-quite-even-close to a pale ale. No hops, not much real beer flavor, and definitely not pale in color. Pretty simple, but that's it's strong point. A good refreshing summery beer.

Sweet apricot and bready malt aromas. Esters are present due to eh apricot presence. No hop aromas. Aromas are well balanced and moderate. Medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Smooth and creamy through the middle with a slow building drying sensation toward the end. Sweet, mellow apricot and malt up front balanced by moderate bitterness through the middle. No hop flavors. Light bready malt near the end as this finished, clean, crisp and dry with a light ready and bitter aftertaste. Fruit, malt and bitterness strike are very well balanced. Exemplifies the style.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2 Pours a clear gold color with a bit of a white head that quickly reduces down to some lacing across the top.    Not a lot to the smell, seemed a bit funky when first poured, but there is malt and some fruit there.    Mainly fruit and sour, leaves a bit of an unpleasant aftertaste.    Feel is basically water.    Not sure what they were going for here, if to be different, they succeeded, but not in a good way. Tastes more like a chemical laced soft drink than a beer. I have had worse beers, but not many.

Taste - Pretty much the same thing as the nose. Nothing much going on here.     Mouthfeel - Finishes dry, a bit fruity. Light body, medium carbonation.     Overall - Meh. Underwhelming, nothing at all stands out. I don't even know if I would recommend it even in a mix and match.

Aroma: Very fruity and aromatic. Lots of Belgian yeast and raspberry up front, with some toasted malt notes imparting aromas of freshly baked sourdough bread. Very nice.    Taste: Very malty up front, quickly followed by some assertive and pleasant raspberry fruitiness, a little sourness, and some honey-like sweetness. Very tasty.    Mouthfeel: Crisp, refreshing, with some pretty good carbonation. With an ABV of 5.1%, there is no presence of alcohol on the palate.    Overall: This is one of my favorite session beers. I really enjoy how refreshing it is with the nicely balanced malt, raspberry and Belgian yeast. Very good.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.25 Tasted 17 January 2015.    Pours a very clear, slightly odd orange color, sort of apricot-toned amber. Half a finger of off-white head, okay retention, not much lacing.    Smell is funny, too. Again, it's sort of apricoty, but with some faint spices, and a chemical feel.     Taste is like someone took the smell and vacuumed all the substance out of it. It's dry and empty, with just a touch of that fruity sweetness. Not at all what I was expecting. Not bad, but not very enjoyable. It's slightly chalky, and there's just not much to it.    Feel is pretty good. Light body, sparkly carbonation. Dries out quickly and suddenly, like tonic water.    An okay beer, but kinda weird across the board. Seems like they tried to make something that would appeal to people who don't really want flavorful beer. Maybe they succeeded, but that's not what I want.

It tastes mass produced.   
look: 3 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.25 Appearance - 3/5  Pours an extremely clear light orange-amber. Little to no head. Can see an above average amount of carbonation rising.    Smell - 4.65/5  A very unique smell, full of many flavors. Overall mostly fruity, berries are the fruit that stands out the most. The smell is so unique that it's hard to describe, other than that it smells fruity and delicious. Perhaps a small amount of malt smell and a tiny hint of alochol smell.    Taste - 3.5/5  Tastes similar to the smell during the beginning of the sip (though the taste is much less strong than I was expecting from the smell), but then changes its character a bit and becomes much less flavorful. There is some sweet malt flavor, with a tinge of fruitiness left. The latter half of the sip is also much more alcoholic. Overall, the flavor in the taste is slightly different than the smell, less flavorful than the smell, and for the most part just not that great. Not really bad either...just "weird". An interesting brew definitely, and I give them points for creativity and uniqueness. But overall, not something I would want to go buy a 6-pack of.    Mouthfeel - 3.8/5  Fairly smooth. In between creamy and crisp (or both?). Slightly less than medium-bodied. Moderate level of carbonation.    Overall - 3.25/5  This is a unique beer, and was definitely worth trying once. I don't think I will be getting again any time soon though.

Some visible carbonation.    Smell - vegetative with some apricot aroma. Apricot saves it otherwise this wouldn't be good.    Taste - starts with cooked veggies again and then a bland apricot flavor comes through. Faint apricot aftertaste, but there's a permeating bitterness through that prevents this from being sweet.    Mouthfeel - light bodied reasonably carbonated. slightly dry finish.    Overall - not a terrible fruit beer, but doesn't stand up to a lot of the other ones on the market. Worth a try especially if you like apricots and more beer like than others in the style, but not my preference.

I absolutely love this beer! This was the first beer I've drank that I would classify as "refreshing." I'd had other Magic Hat brews and brought to a BBQ and everyone made the same face when they noticed how smooth and fresh the beer was after a first sip. Pairs extremely well with food and is and ideal summer beer.

It wasn't bad, and I'd get it again. Definitely is worth serving warmer than the crazy cold way we tend to serve beer here in the States. Malty, kind of sweet. Nice biscuity crispness at the end. I wouldn't buy a 6-pack, but I'd get it at a bar again. Pleasant but not particularly unique to me.   
TheRealPour 
Poured a clear golden body with a one finger bubbly white head that quickly receded leaving no lacing. A fairly boring looking beer. Scents of sweet raspberry, strawberry, blackberry, peach and light berry perfume. Overall impression of flavor is of a very fruit-forward beer, no other aromas are present. Very sweet and fitting a fruit beer, but a bit lacking in balance. Flavor begins lightly sweet and fruity with notes of peach, raspberry, lightly sour strawberry and not much else. Middle is slightly drier with the same flavors present. Finish is lightly dry with the same flavors present, but with light grainy malt in the background. Aftertaste is tart berries quickly giving way to grainy malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a very fruity beer that is balanced mostly towards berry flavors, with malt most apparent on the aftertaste. It isn't as sweet as the nose let on however and is pleasantly dry on the finish. Better than expected. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and an effervescent slightly chalky feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very drinkable, light beer, refreshing and crisp. Overall this isn't a bad fruit beer. It has a rather pleasant sweet aroma, leading into a nicely sweet beginning flavor with a slightly dry finish aided by a crisp mouthfeel. It is refreshing, not at all cloying and fairly well done.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 It's the beer you get as a session while you wait for your bros to get to the bar so you can try some exotic pints with them.

i was told this had a unique flavor...I wasn't lied too from what I tastes. Which I'm not sure what I do taste. I feel as if there is some vegtables used in the brewing process. I gain a hint a tartness that is paired well with a mild sweetness. For any of cooks out there, I do reccomend using this to marinade chicken with.

look: 3.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Pours a clear golden orange with a lace that soon disapates. Big syrupy fruit in the nose; mainly apricot and some peach. Aroma also has some buttery elements, grain and even some cinnamon. The drawback is that these aromas feel artificial. Taste has a similar fruity and syrupy apricot feel. Low hop level, and some grainy malt backbone. Crisp on the tongue and light medium mouthfeel. However, as the carbonation flattens out, the feel becomes syrupy. Another issue is that the balance is a bit off in favor of a sweet fruit extract feel that is a bit off putting.   
I was sampling beers, you know a super market cares when you can put together a six pack. Before I tried this, I was drinking a favorite IPA (Coronado, Idiot IPA), so this was a step down. It is interesting. I had two look this beer up because I thought I tasted peaches. I see it might be made with apricots. Interesting, not for a purist though, not a session beer. I would try it again on tap.

Doesn't knock my socks off but is a very drinkable beer.   Pours a nice amber yellow with less than a finger off foam. I prefer 3 fingers but I think 1 suits the beer.   Initial smell is fruity infused with tart- nothing specifically noticeable on the nose but nice smell.   Good taste nothing special but unique on its own. Doesn't taste like any other beer-distinct.   First few sips are better than the end few.   Not bad.

Pours amber, with a one finger white head that leaves quite a fair amount of lacing behind.    Smells is interesting, nothing I can discern. (I know this beer contains apricot, but I don't think I've ever isolated an apricot scent or flavor elsewhere for reference) A sweet/sour smell.    Taste isn't as sweet as I remember, maybe it's the events of the night and my palette. Slightly sour/tart and a bit savory. Can't pick out specifics more than that.    This is a middle ground brew, nothing to clamor over, I've had it multiple times, but this is the first time I've reviewed.    Light bodied, crisp, and drinkable are points in it's favor.

Had a bottle a couple of weeks ago after it had been in my fridge for a few weeks. The beer had some mild hop flavor and was OK, but there was not much that was special about it. Low ABV is sometimes desirable.
