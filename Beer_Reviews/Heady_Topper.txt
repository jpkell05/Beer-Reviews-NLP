Basically, it does very well what it says it will. It’s a classic and it tastes great. I’ve had a bunch of more interesting, more flavorful beers recently. Not sure what to think- it’s obviously very good, just not as mindblowing as I hoped.  Edit- is it even that hoppy? I swear there’s so much better stuff than this... not that it isn’t great, just so much is good now...

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Review #500    So I’ll be the first to admit that my expectations for this highly-regarded and well-lauded beer were already sky-high. I always had this at the top of my list of beers to try, and when the opportunity came to buy it online and have it shipped to me I couldn’t pass it up. I first tried pouring a little bit of this beer carefully into a glass in order to examine the appearance, knowing full well to leave the residual hops residue in the can for maximum aroma. The beer poured a hazy orange-yellow color with some nice fluffy white head and very nice-looking spotty lingering lacing. Not quite as much lacing as I would’ve expected but still very nice nonetheless. The smells initially did not overly excite me, however. Smells surprisingly faintly of some dankness, a combination of citrus zest hops and floral hops, more faint herbal and piney hops, and then some malt, caramel and vanilla in the background. The taste was mainly of muted grapefruit, lemon, orange, tangerine, guava and a little passionfruit fruity hops. In the background was some much weaker herbal, floral and piney hops along with some caramel, bread, vanilla and a well-balanced malt backbone. I think I must’ve tried the beer too quickly and eagerly when it was too cold, straight out of the refrigerator, because as the beer warmed the flavors came to life and the aromas intensified as well. Approximately 10 to 15 minutes after I took the beer out of the fridge and opened it I experienced greater depth and complexity of both the aromas and flavors. This is when I stopped being so disappointed and realized what some of the hype was all about. Smooth, mild, slightly creamy mouthfeel which was slightly sticky. Great amount of carbonation. The aromas and taste straight from the can were very similar except maybe there was a little more dankness and hoppy bitterness along with a sharper bite; perhaps the can warmed the beer up more rapidly. It was just so dangerously easy to drink and the higher ABV is completely hidden as this almost felt like a sessionable regular IPA. Juicy, flavorful and crisp. A truly outstanding beer, one worthy of its great reputation, and I am very happy that I bought multiples from the online store. I would rate this one of my top IPAs ever.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 My personal favorite beer to date. When I had my first can I was surprisingly disappointed. Living in Michigan I had tried many New England IPA's in the past couple years and I had enjoyed lots of them with some being super bug juice bombs like the beers from old nation. I had decided to go to Vermont for some snowboarding at store and to also visit the alchemist and bring some nice cases back! I had brought my expectations up very high for this beer and couldn't wait to try my first heady topper. When I took my first sip I guess I was expecting too much and just seemed like it was another good beer nothing to blow your mind about. But as I continued to sip it the flavors began to reveal themselves and by my 3rd heady topper I was hooked and in awe of the quality of beer I was getting and still to this day every time I drink a heady topper I'm blown away with every sip! (On a side note I have recently tried many of tree houses beers and still am most impressed with heady topper)

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 Very good, but a little overrated. Here goes:    A: Cloudy yellow. Pours a large head, however, and leaves great lacing. Very, very fluffy head.    S: Very pungent. Grassiness pervades the scent - lots of flowers in this. Also lots of lemon peel, some orange, and grapefruit.    T: Good, but somewhat vegetal. It's very, very grassy - the hops are really overwhelming. Floral flavors combine with lemon and grapefruit. However, while the floralness of this beer is quite overpowering, but it's still somewhat nice.    F: Not as soft as other Vermont beers, but still great.    O: A good beer, but somewhat overrated.

It’s good, but I would have been head over heels had I tried it three years ago.     Look: hazy, bright orange.     Aroma: pungent hops, acidic citrus and funky dank hops.     Taste: follows nose—pungent, sharp hops with lots of citrus rind flavors. Bitter but balanced—definitely a dank, funkiness which is distinct and good. On the finish it cleans up and ends dry with some lingering hop oils.     Mouthfeel: heavy and wet, tingly, but ends medium/dry.     Overall: really distinct flavors that remind me of a mix between NEIPA and Belching Beaver’s style IPAs such as Hop Highway or Phantom Bride.    Glad I tried it and I have several cans left. I’ll enjoy it but I won’t be seeking it out and paying the $6 per pint can price. There are too many other great beers that abound...but still a great hazy DIPA!

look: 3 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Picked up can at brewery, poured into pint glass.  Straw/slight golden, mild-moderately hazy appearance, with relatively little but lasting white, creamy head.  Smells dank, vegatal, jungle floor, rotten papaya, grapefruit-pineapple, herbal, spicy.  Tastes of rotten fermented papaya-grapefruit-pineapple, herbal, bruised onion with sharp bitter finish  Medium, solid body with good mouthfeel.  I have had the fortune of receiving, over the past couple years, numerous 4 packs of this beer.   Overall, it is too busy and over the top for me - like everything and the kitchen sink in here when it comes to new hop flavor profile. And too vegatal for me. Having said that, there is no denying the foresight and ingenuity of this endeavor. The world is a better place because of it's existence.

Hazy light orange, big and slightly off-white foam head receding ever-so-slowly, sticking to the glass as it does so.  S. Tropical and citrus. Pineapple, lemon, orange, honey, something like vanilla, a bit spicy. Some mango and melon as it warms.  T. Nice. Spicy, citrus pith, orange, lemon, citrus zest, crackery, more juicy in the middle, pretty big bitterness in the end. Some honey and sweet berry in there as it warms.  F. Sticky, medium body, soft, ample carbonation getting your whole mouth involved. Resinous in the end but pretty dry, not sweet. No real booziness.  O. Loads of hops, but also an incredibly well made beer. Awesome hoppy flavors. Plenty of bitterness. Just enough balance. Well crafted. Cheers!!!

This review is about the part poured in a glassed. Simply because it's the way I prefer it.  It pours a gorgeous (not so hazy) golden colour with amber notes and a two fingers head.     Aroma of honey, melon, pine resin, mango, cereal notes. Really clean and to the point    The taste is perfect. Yes perfect. And it's better as it warms up. It's perfectly balanced. The bitterness is important and just what you want to compliment the powerful flavours. The hops are upfront with mango, pine needle, citrus, melon, passionfruit, weed. The malt bill is great and noticeable. The yeast brings peach notes and make a real link between all the component    The texture is semi-dry with a fine moderate carbonation with a good presence in the mouth.     I am in love with this beer. I could easily drink liters of this one. It grows on you at each sip.     Wonderful

Complex hop aroma with pine and citrus, but not a big malt aroma.    Big hop flavor with a nuttiness in addition to the great pine and citrus noted in aroma. Surprisingly prominent alcohol flavor in the finish, which detracted the experience for me. Bitterness in finish is pretty gentle, but is drying.    Medium body and carbonation, a bit of alcohol warming.     I might have killed it by pouring it into a glass instead of drinking from the can as ordered, but while I expected an 8% beer that would drink like it was 6%, it tasted more like 10% to be. Too boozy for my taste.    ----    Original review above. As warmed it seemed less boozy. Original avg rating of 3.79. Boosting some scores slightly based on the end of the can.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Can:  A bit of a haze from the stream creates a nice light-diffusing body. A fluffy white head falls slowly, attempting to cling to the inner wall, but leaving only white indentations and scratches. The beer has a yellow hue in proper light, but a slightly burnt orange with different lighting.    The nose didn't jump out at me as I poured the beer like Focal Banger did. The aroma starts with a significant dankness with a nice herbal aspect. There's also a note of peach in my first sniffs, but it didn't remain as obvious as I searched for additional aromas. Secondary notes include grapefruit pith and lemon rind on the citrus side, and a hint of green onion on the herbal side, more the former than the latter.    A malty opening yields or leads to a very soft, creamy mouthfeel. The good thing about the feel is that it comes without the higher thickness of many a NE IPA. The malt has a honey biscuit sweetness that borders on being a little strong and I'll go with a bit of a papaya flavor. The flavor takes a nice turn, starting with a little bit of tangerine (and later, a return of some peach), but then it really brings the herbal aspects of the hops. The herbal notes slowly sneak forward in the taste as the beer warms, lingering on my palate between sips with a low level of dankness to help carry that sensation along. The back end gains a more wooden herbaceousness, and even a bit of light juniper note.    A really nice beer to drink, soft, creamy malt backbone to carry an herbal bitterness that has a dank side to it. Not as dank as I expected from impressions of other's thoughts, but a more subtle, easy to enjoy level of said characteristic.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 The hazy (but not cloudy) amber colored beer pours out into a Duvel glass with a 1 1/2” fluffy off-white head that recedes slowly but visibly until it eventually becomes a thin irregular island of foam on the surface with a ring around the glass and having left a webbing of patches and irregular streaks of lacing on the sides of the glass. Sipping creates a couple of arch shaped patches of foam with some small patches and legs of lacing between the two.    The fruit aromas are fairly strong here and filled with citrus and citric zest, some tropical fruits and a bit of resin. In the background there’s some crackery and caramel malt.     Much as expected from the nose there’s lots of citrus, mostly grapefruit and zest, plenty of tropical fruits in the background along the pine resin and malt. The crackery, light caramel malt sweetness softens and smooths out the bitterness from the hops so that the bitterness is there but as a background element. The alcohol is well concealed here.    The mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly smooth and only lightly crisp with some moderate persistent carbonation. The finish begins as the crackery, caramel sweetness begin to fade and allow the fruit flavors to move forward a bit as they too begin to fade with the bitterness closing out the fairly long semi-dry ending in the back of the palate.    Overall quite drinkable and enjoyable. I will think the reputation of this beer is well deserved and I look forward to having it again. For this beer the focus is on the hops and a range of hop flavors and with the bitterness being noticeable but almost incidental. I would also say that the beer is fairly temperature sensitive in that the tropical fruits become more noticeable as the beer warms a bit. As for drinking this beer from the can, as requested on the can, I chose not to do so since my interest was in the full range of sensory experience offered by the beer. (Also the beer was enjoyed from the glass by many for years before the beer was ever canned and I’m an occasional traditionalist.)

No. It is amazingly balanced with a very distinct flavor profile. I will say there was more pine in this than anticipated. Exceptional IPA but I cannot consider it the best I have had.

After that can had been sitting in my fridge for a couple of weeks, I finally built up the...nerve, I guess, to try it. It has a very tasty bitterness and the beer is quite rich. However, I prefer lower abv beers for a reason and this beer didn't alter that. It's boozy. I drank some "from the can," as recommended, but also poured much of it into a glass. Didn't really notice any difference there.

Yeah, its a good beer. Is it the best beer I've ever had? Heck no. It won't make my top 10 list. I'm a very fair reviewer. I'm not like a lot of nutcases on here that throw a 2 overall rating to a palatable beer.    What I respect about this beer (and something you find in some of the great beers) is how well they are able to mask the ABV in this beer. I highly respect that. The flavors are fun. Nice bright and lively fruit notes like grapefruit and citrus notes. You will find a bit of pine and bitters in this brew. Not overwhelming like some nasty IPAs. A good balance of bite. I'm a fan of grapefruit. The actual fruit. I'd eat them all the time when I was younger. I'd sprinkle some sugar on top of the grapefruit slices and down it with a spoon. No issues there for me! I'm however not a big fan of the taste of pine. It's not something I actively seek out when eating food at a restaurant: "Chef could you put some pinecone and pine needles into this dish!?". That's something you won't ever hear me say. haha.     I'd drink it again for sure but I wouldn't go actively seeking it out and paying an arm and a leg. I've got respect, but its just not my thing.

"drink from the can" is a little misleading - I suspect they just tell you to do that because hazy ipas weren't a thing back when this came out, and they wanted to avoid people being dissuaded by the look of it. Good experience overall, but I like focal banger much more.

Well balanced but still highly hop-focused    T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the citrus and stone fruit (mostly orange and peach/apricot) along with a mellow, moderate bitterness. Picks up some light malt that balances things out nicely. Finishes with lingering citrus and light bitterness    M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Look - given that the beer says "drink from the can" on it, I only poured out a very small amount of the beer out to judge its look. Straw yellow in color, and cloudy. Not much head (most likely from the small pour), but lacing is present.  Smell - this is judge from the smell inside the can. A full assortment of hoppy aroma, especially strong on piney-ness. Grassiness also present.  Taste - hops, hops and more hops. initially, a hoppy forward flavor that is bold. the hoppiness lingers for a long long time, including a whole spectrum of hoppy flavors. finishes with a light sweetness in the end and leaving you craving for more.   Feel - a full bodied beer. carbonation is slightly below average. at 8% ABV, the can says it right: "so drinkable, it's scary".  Overall - Heady Topper is a beer ahead of its time. in the current craft beer world where IPAs dominate, it is no longer as unique as it was 15 years ago. however, it is really a pioneer and a symbol of the American craft beer tradition. and to this day, this is one of the best IPAs that I have ever had.

OCCASION: Celebrating the first day of my twentieth year in education with a beer whose history is equally worth celebrating... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... pours from a can not three days old, thanks to Jeff and his Vermont-NJ dual citizenship... builds a four-finger, snow white head of thick, bubbly clumps that cling and web down the glass... its body is golden orange, hazy and bubbly, illuminated when light passes through... impressive first impression: a wall of resinous pine, pineapple, melon, orange, and lemon, merging with fragrant musky basement flowers... further, hard fruits of apple and pear swirl with a hearty, lightly toasted malt backbone... at 8%, this sips smoothly, with a lively tooth rattle and a simmering finish that leaves a strong resinous aftertaste... orange peel and grapefruit reign in this deluge of citric storm--a delivery on its promise to maximize its hop experience... something in this is also unique--the air and yeast create the dankness that ups its ante... start to finish, nothing NOT to like about this beer--big, bold, respectful, flavorful, fresh and hoppy.... this destination beer is indeed worthwhile, and I could only imagine having a few on a nightly basis, which i what this was meant to do, even at its IBUs....I am so thankful Jeff wrangled this for me...BIG experience crossed off the beer bucket list!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Drank from the can except for a pour into a taster to assess appearance  A: Hazy pale yellow/orange with a 1/2-finger head  S: Mixed fresh citrus (grapefruit/orange/pomelo) & citrus rind, grass/herbs, hints of pine/earth  T: Bliss. Fresh & juicy hops showing everything in the nose adding smooth malts and a light caramel note. Immensely complex yet balanced making it very easy to drink  M: Medium-bodied, fresh  O: I still prefer Pliny by a hair but this is absolutely worthy of its rank and one of the best beers I've had

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Fresh cans from 8/3/18. Tastes best after a couple weeks imo.     Grapefruit pith, lemon citrus, earthy, piney, medium thick and noticeable malt backbone with a hint of sweetness. A prominent bitterness that builds from halfway all they way through the finish. Hop resin and oils coat the palate. The Conan yeast must impart some sort of flavor because this beer tastes really unique - not just from the hops. This is a great Vermont IPA, very different from hazys. Has a fresh and intense bitterness that reminds me of west coast ipas but brighter and more citrusy tropical hops.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Thanks to CW who muled this back from his trip to the NE...been waiting a long long time to try this one. Since I had a cold the day it was dropped off, I held off a week, until I could appreciate it properly.....so we're probably at about a month since canning. Anyway, here goes: I don't care what the can says, I'm pouring it into my trusty nonic: glad I did, since I wouldn't want to miss this beer's nose. Cloudy (but not milky) warm gold, 1 1/2 finger white head of medium tight bubbles, decent retention, decent lacing. Nose is pretty huge with tropical fruits (with more round and less sharp flavor profiles) and a warm bready malty undercurrent that complements all the mango, tangerine, grapefruit, and passion fruit notes extremely well...there are layers, but each one just brings more of the same. Taste follows the nose pretty well...extremely full and harmonious flavor profile. Really smooth, there is really no bite or bitterness, at all; the malts lay down a fairly substantial mouthful over which the hops really shine without popping or biting. For my own tastes, the finish meanders a little and isn't as memorable as the other dimensions of the beer. All in all, really really good beer...would love to try it side-by-side with Abrasive, my local go-to dipa.

Deep yellow and hazy liquid, however, much more translucent than opaque, you can see enough bubbles to suspect there’s even more there you can’t see. while there is an initial whiff of dank marijuana to the nose leading up to the super-juicy tangerine, pink grapefruit citrus, mango, peach, apricot and melon fruit scents, solid underpinning of cocoa and vanilla bean malts, croissant flakes, well balanced and not bitingly hoppy, lasts well without coming off as brawny for brawn’s sake. Medium-bodied, dry mouth entry with a momentary tacky sensation. Quickly switches gears to pine sap, mint and all of that grapefruit and orange citrus. Odd in that it is indeed very hoppy but in such a way that all the rough edges have been burred off. More of a burnt character to the mocha, cocoa here, malts less sweet. The papaya, mango, pineapple to apricot fruit offers equal parts sour and sweet. Carbonation tends towards the fluffier side of things. Shows balance and poise for its scale, a reputation well earned.

Pours a rich dirty gold. Upon the first sip, I didn't notice anything that spectacular, and then it hit me. Lots of awesome hoppy goodness with no juice-bomb BS that characterizes most IPAs now (thank you, beer gods). I can see why this beer is legendary. The only reason I did not give it a 5 is specifically because my taste buds want more flower power in my IPA. Excellent beer. Try it for yourself (if you can!). I definitely hope to do so again soon.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Having had this beer multiple times over several years now, this is my first time officially reviewing it; and, every year it's a steadfast, yet mind-blowingly impressive beverage. Even though I can grab this locally on consistent basis I still leave room in my cooler every time I visit VT. So, while maybe not worth the drive anymore, it's a beer I'd never pass up. Onto the tasting which was picked up from Stowe 1 wk ago.    A: Golden Apricot. Mythic color...the stuff you'd imagine a cave of treasure to look like. Clarity borders on a chilled haze; not transparent, but not murky or milkshake like. Head is an off-color cream...very nitpicky here but I'd prefer pure white. Mousse top with consistent bubble lattice below. Nice lacing.    S: Bursts from the can like the genie out of the golden lamp (or silver in the can's view). Floral wildflower honey, tree sap and piney, citrus rind, tropical green papaya and fresh cut mango; green stalks of hay, herbal apple mint.    M: Luscious, juicy and med-full body. It also has a firm texture bounded in by its crisp effervescence and bitterness, so it samples quite refreshing as well. A bit of alcohol ether in their too.    T: Sour tangerine and ruby red grapefruit. Fruity esters give off the impression of a tropical cornucopia: mango and pineapple. Then some temperate spicy, herbal, earth tones: pine, mint, stone fruit, gingery warmth. Good balance provided by a caramel maltiness.   Overall, I can't get out of my head how similar in taste this is to another cult fave of mine, NEBCO G-Bot. It parallels it very closely with the exception that this just has a bit more malt background, which makes it a little less bitter overall and more lush.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured just enough into a glass (2oz) so I could look at it, will drink the rest from the can. Fairly clear (I'm sure there are floaties in the can) honey yellow with a white head. Aroma is citrusy, hoppy, piney. Flavor is sweet and hoppy up front and has more malt backbone than I was expecting. Medium body feel. Very nice beer, would love to have it super fresh (not sure the age of this one) and/or on tap at the source.

Hints of malty sweetness in the background but you have to go searching for it behind a mountain of hops.  T: Taste is straight hops with pine resin, citrus rind, some grapefruit, and hop oils. Slight herbalness and earthy notes at times as well. Sweetness struggles to come through but it does as the sip warms. Swallow is oily and resinous hops with more pine, grapefruit and citrus.  M: The beer has a medium body with a slightly oily and slick feel. Carbonation is slightly prickly which is nice and the beer has an oily and refreshing finish.  O: Overall this beer is just insane. Just a straight punch in the face with hops. This can is a little closer to the tap experience than the first one I drank but heady from a tap is still king when it comes to an unruly amount of hops in a beer while still being drinkable. Definitely a hyped beer but it is a unique experience.

Finish is tropical and fruity    T: ripe mango, pineapple and apricot. Some bitter herbal tea leaf behind that. A hint of melon and sweet orange behind that. A big hit of sweetness in here as well. Finish is a little bitter on the back of the tongue     M: medium mouthfeel with mid-low carbonation. A touch of the fluffy mouthfeel, but not as much as some of the newer NEIPAs    O: extremely smooth DIPA with good balance. Fruit, sweet, and bitter all in good harmonization. There is an obvious hype factor with this beer, but it is definitely worthy of praise.

I just had to see it, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. This is a beautiful beer. Nothing crazy or different, it just looks... right. Big, fluffy head, that takes its time to fizzle out. Smell, as everyone says, is full of citrus and pine. Flavor is right there as well, with a distinct, resinous, dankness on the finish. Not gonna blow your mind by being something no other beer is or will ever be, but absolutely deserving of being on everyone's 'must try' list.

Pours a hazy grapefruit juice gold producing 2 fingers of glowing white, somewhat lasting head. Aroma is fruity, citrusy grapefruit, pale bready malt & spun sugar/cotton candy. Taste is similar to the nose with a perfectly balanced finish that transitions to a pleasant bitterness. The most unique thing about this brew to my mind is its mouthfeel: slick, creamy and slightly viscous with a tiny pricke that fades to an astringent bitterness. Absolutely delightful!

This my highest rating on Beer advocate. Great job guys.

Would I call it out as the best IPA on Beer Advocate based on my fairly limited experience? Probably not. Nonetheless, a good box to check and I don't regret it one bit!

Excellent enough to make the trek to Vermont and stand in a long line for a 4-pack? No. But it's one of the best NEIPAs I've had.     I was also skeptical about the suggestion that this be sipped straight from the can. Being old school, I ignored this for my first one, and as it turns out, the suggestion was correct. This beer loses something when it's poured. The hops lessen and the malt sweetness comes more to the fore.     Very well balanced, but at 8% abv, it does pack a punch, though you don't notice it at first.

It's a good note but the the chalk, ever so slight mineralization is there (almost like a touch of oxidation). The taste has this note as well which is why my rating on it is not higher. The beer is excellent and a great IPA.

Pours cloudy straw gold with a one inch white head dissipating fairly quickly     Nose: Pine, floral hops. Not necessarily the most potent hop-forward aroma out there, but very balanced.    Taste: very balanced. Nice bite from pine/floral hops right off the bat. Some bready malt follows. Finish is dry with a touch of bittering hops, but not overly bitter by any means. Hop character is actually not as intense as I expected, but the flavor profile is incredibly refined.    Feel: exceptional. Extremely light on the palate despite packing 8% abv. About as drinkable as a DIPA can be.

Flavor is very delicate and cajoling, more melon, grassy hops that are not too bitter, wheat grass, dry orange, cracker straw malt. In today’s world not the most flashy IPA but the balance is masterful and it remains a classic

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Sampled about half of the can by pouring it into a 9.75 ounce arome glass and the rest directly from the 16 ounce can itself (gotta do what the can tells you).  Look: Golden and hazy in color (slightly darker in color than The Alchemist's Crusher) with about 1-1.5 fingers of head.  Smell: Definitely hoppy, but not as strong or pungent as The Alchemist's Crusher  Taste: Extremely drinkable Imperial IPA. Expectly hoppy/bitter, but very well balanced. No unpleasant aftertaste.  Feel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  Overall: There is no question why this is considered a world-class beer by so many. I only regret that I didn't do a blind taste test with other Imperial IPAs.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 F I N A L L Y !    Tried both poured into a glass and "from the can!".     A hazy golden yellow color with a tall fluffy stark white head of 3 fingers, tons of lace destroying the glass as it recedes.     Aroma is just tons of juicy, herbal, oily hop resins. Explosive. It's dank, it's pitty, it's fruity, it's sweet, it's biscuity, it's herbal. Great!    Those dank resins follow into the flavor as well, imparting flavors of pine, cantaloupe, honey, wood, grapefruit, dank, resins, and crisp biscuit malt. The flavor from the can is fresher tasting, less offensive. Crisper, greener, more biscuity, slightly more fruity. Lingering oils still remain. Reminding me of an herbal Tree House IIPA recipe with a touch less sweetness from the can.     Feel is crisp and highly resiny. Lots of lingering palate busting oils.     Overall, if you want all of the flavors - both the good and the bad (even the ugly!), pour it into a glass, you'll twist your face quite a bit. If you want the crispy edges with the lingering hop resins and slight biscuit sweetness, drink this sucker from the can. I prefer the latter. Today's IIPA's are extremely well crafted and The Alchemist's Heady Topper seems to fade into the background in that regard - however it warrants some respect as a trailblazer for the style, a cult following for a baby born before the haze craze came forth. Better options today? You bet. But you owe it to yourself to try this at least once.

Right up there with TH Julius as our favorite so far. It's probably a good thing for our budget that we have to travel 6 Hours to buy more.

Dank aroma with green onions, light toasted herbs and even lighter peach tea.    Taste follows the nose with a touch of orange sweetness, a slight nuttiness and a nice firm bitterness to it.    Really full mouthfeel, slightly sticky and very well carbonated. Maybe a little overly carbonated to my taste.    This is a delicious beer. The full mouthfeel, nice bitterness and dankness are all great.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 As I raised the can for my first sip, I was punched in the nose by the pine tree smell. My first thought was, this might be a bit much. When it hit my mouth, I thought, OK, this isn't over the top hopped.     Then the magic hit. As I started swallowing, this stuff just whispered too me, "keep going dude".....and I did.     And it was good.    Just like it says on the can "So drinkable, it's scary."    Most IPAs with a good bit of hop aren't the kind of thing you want to just tip back and keep chugging, but this stuff is.     I will definitely be back for more.    One other thing.     I had one with a spicy Thai dish and one later, in my hotel room by itself. It was definitely better with the spicy food.

The malt backbone stands up to the hops perfectly, yet neither aspect distracts from the other. The balance of pine and citrus is just absolutely perfect. Heady continues to impress.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 This review is not for the beer snobs who use words like "earthy", "piney", "zesty", and "mouthfeel". It's for the regular guy who appreciates excellent beer, but not necessarily overly elaborate descriptions. There's nothing wrong with beer snobs, so don’t take offense. I guess I’m one myself since I unapologetically carry my own cooler to parties just in case crappy beer being served (yes, I take enough for others), but I have too many other interests and hobbies to learn the lingo. So on to the review...    I joined this site for one purpose…to review this beer, and maybe a few others if I have time. I’m admittedly way late to the game on this particular brew. I love beer, but I'm not geeked out on it. I had no idea this one even existed until my in-laws (who live in VT) brought me some for my birthday. They said “it’s all the rage in VT”. That was the first strike against it. They said “it’s in such demand they ration it”. Strike two.     I’m not the kind of person who buys into hype. It usually sends me the other way. So I actually went into this being very skeptical. I read the can and decided to just crack the first one open and drink it as suggested rather than pouring it into a glass. I smelled it. First thought..."huh, it smells really good, unlike anything I’ve ever smelled before". I tasted it. First thought…"huh, tastes unlike anything I tasted before. This stuff ain’t bad". I get to the bottom of the first can quickly, every swig tasting a little better than the last.     The next day, something strange happened. When 0:Beer30 rolled around, I found myself not only wanting to crack open another can of this stuff, but actually craving it. The taste of this particular juice was buried somewhere deep in my subconscience, surfacing with a vengeance at just the right time. I was hooked after just one beer the day before, and I didn’t even know it.    Still not knowing the extent of the hype surrounding this beer (I took what my in-laws said with a grain of salt), I thought maybe I should call my beer-loving friends to tell them about this stuff. But wait…that might mean I have to share some of my very limited supply with them. So my list of beer friends got narrowed down to just two that love good beer as much as I do. The first beer aficionado friend said “Holy s&!t, you got Heady Topper?? Been wanting to try that forever but can’t get it”. The second said something similar. O.K., so this is the first sign that the hype might actually be for real. I shared one can with each, but it wasn’t easy to let them go.     Here’s the bottom line…I can’t stand hype, and if anything, I went into this somewhat biased against it. But I have to say, this is unlike any beer I have ever drank before or since, and I have tried a LOT of different brews. I’ve been on a mission to try to find something even remotely close, but have failed. There may be “better” brews out there somewhere yet undiscovered, but until I find it I might have to say this is the best beer I've had to date. That is, if you could label any one particular beer the "best" if you like many different styles and types. But everything new I try is somewhat disappointing by comparison.    Some of the hype surrounding this beer may be manufactured by limiting availability, and by not being able to purchase this stuff anywhere but Vermont (If anyone knows where I can get it in PA, please let me know) But I will say that most of the hype is deserved. This is truly a fantastic brew. But be warned…if you manage to get your hands on some, it may leave you craving more, and you probably won’t be able to get it.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 I waited to have the entire 4 pack before writing this review. The first one I had, I ignored the brewer’s instruction and poured it into a 12 oz snifter. The smell and taste were extremely raw, almost like eating raw hops. The smell was the same, like those of hops after being entered into the boil. The beer had so much hop and yeast in it that it looked like a swampy mess. To be honest, I was not impressed.    But, never the less, I persisted. I had the next from the can, And although I could not see the beer, and the aroma was certainly compromised, I found the raw bitterness subdued, and what emerged instead was an intense citrus sweetness.     In the next, I discovered delicate floral and grassy tastes that perhaps only a honeybee would recognize. The difference between lemon peel and lemon zest can be noted.    By the end of the 4 pack, I had discovered notes of honey and melon. Each one more haunting than the previous.

Had this beer early on and hated it. Actually spit it out a beer festival in Burlington. Since then, as I have belatedly matured as a beer drinker, I have come to love this beer. It is refreshing, clean and yes hoppy! It is my go to non- dark brew (love stouts, porters, brown ales, dunkels etc). Sorry for taking so long to come around to this great beer

I was clearly exercising a lack of patience with the cans I had obtained in late November 2017. Now I am firmly convinced the sweet spot is 8-10 weeks from canning. I drank all but 1 and was curious why I wasn't as impressed as on previous occasions. Let me tell you at 9 weeks the look, smell, flavor, and feel transported me to the other side of the room.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Worth the trip and the wait. Heady is always a top DIPA! NOT for aging, it will have sediment after only a few weeks. I recommend using a glass, but pouring a small amount (1/5) of a can into a small snifter and then downing the last 5th from the can.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Pours a hazy, bright orange coloration with a medium, frothy head. Smell is very hoppy, with quite sweet, juicy and slightly zesty notes of citrus and tropical fruit: grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, papaya, peach; with the merest hint of a certain, dank grassiness and pine. Bit of cat pee there as well. Taste is incredibly hoppy with almost no detectable malt presence at all, just the slightest hint of biscuity malt. Quite sweet, juicy and slightly dank notes of citrus and tropical fruits: grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, papaya, peach that are greatly balanced. There's also a very definitive grassiness to this. I'm not really getting a very resinous character from it, but there is just a hint of pine coming through. Finishes quite bittersweet, with a moderate bitterness that could be considered strong for the style. The Mouthfeel is incredible here, very smooth soft and effervescent, Medium Body and carbonation. So this is the fabled Heady Topper. I can totally see why it's been labeled as the original NEIPA and honestly don't get the controversy that some people like to put on it. This is very sweet and juicy and neither as resinous nor bitter as some people claim, although the bitterness is high for the style. Also, I was quite surprised to not find a single floater in my glass after pouring this into it.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Pours a golden, opaque yellow with a thick white foamy head with a nice mixture of bubble sizes. A very bright color, really nice.     Aroma of citrus rind, pine, orange, peach.     Took a sip and said "Holy fuck." Tons of tropical fruit, bubblegum, pine, candied peach. Really amazing complexity.     Medium body, very nicely carbonated, a slight resin left behind.     Hot damn. I have taken to writing more in my reviews recently, but this is pretty overwhelming. A ton of flavor and aroma, incredibly well rounded with the bitterness and pine notes. Just fantastic. Maybe I need to come back to this and give it a more leveled review, but this might be the best beer I've had.

It did not leave me with a bitter after-taste and definitely was worthwhile throughout. The color was as expected from an IPA and the taste was smooth and piney. I will look for it again, perhaps some day enjoying it from the tap.

Pliny hits you up front with hops and leaves you sweet. Where Heady comes in with a malty sweetness and goes out a little bitter. Great balance though and very drinkable

The hunt was a lot of fun in the old days, I'll admit. I love IPAs and try different brewers efforts regularly, but find my self coming back to HT time and time again. It is truly the benchmark, both in the can and in an appropriate glass (also available at your local Heady retailer!).

The drink from the can instructions provided make sense for that reason. First few sips of the can taste world's better than the last few. Hoppy combinations all around, with slight fruit aromas but not overpowering. Solid double IPA. Be sure to drink fresh because the unfilitered parts change flavor if kept too long. If anyone wants to try one in the Bay Area, message me. Have a dozen or so as of 12/23/17

Having been on a Sip of Sunshine binge it was immediately apparent that HT is in a class of its own. The crack of the can followed by a beautiful burst of hoppy goodness flooding out of the can was just the beginning. If smell is the first attribute to consuming food then HT nails it with this been. Citrus, crisp evergreen, everything right about an IPA fills your nose with immense pleasure. All this before you even take a sip. Taste is complex, smooth, perfectly balanced and finishes with a clean sophisticated flavor which resonates for just the right amount of time before you indulge again.     Heady Topper lives up to and exceeds expectations with this offering. Now if only they would expand distribution!

Very good citrus aroma with piney undertones. Blends very well. Aroma is similar to a NEIPA, but the taste is definitely not. Very smooth taste. Fresh citrus taste with a strong piney hop. Definite bitterness in the aftertaste that linger for a while. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Pale golden color with a half finger head the lingers and has slowly fading bubbles on top of the liquid. Nose is the bar that NE IPA's shoot for with citrus, pine, and lime peel. Taste is a delicate balance of earthy, citrus, and pine hops with a mildly bitter finish from hop oils. Medium body and medium-high carbonation with a dash of hop essence that lingers.  I had this as a celebratory/special moment beer and it lived up to it's reputation and my sky high expectations. It took a while to get it down to me, but it's a damn good one. So clean and hoppy without destroying the palate.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 16 oz can with no date on it. Enjoyed on Thanksgiving at my brother-in-law's. This is my second rumble with Heady. First time I had it was at my bachelor party but was too "preoccupied" to review, let's say.    Pale gold in color, bordering straw, with a slight haze to it. Big, persistent, frothy, white head that leaves sparse lacing behind.    From the first whiff, you realize that you can forget about any malt or yeast in this beer, because it's all about the hops. Pine, grass, citrus, and grapefruit make up the aroma. It's not much more complex than that, but it's delightful.    The flavor is a heavy, unabashed display of hops. But it keeps a light enough feel to it that makes it easy to drink, with no sign of the 8% ABV. Medium bodied with a sticky and resinous texture and a bitter finish.    If you like hops, you will like this beer. Simple as that. It has more in common with a West coast IPA than a NEIPA, and is a much better product than the latter. A classic IPA that should be on every beer lover's bucket list.

I'm willing to share, but few I know want to live the experience. Yum!

Medium carb. More bitterness than many of the best NEIPAs out there today, but a good chunk of it drops out on the finish	  O — Not much else to say about this beer that hasn’t already been said many times over.

It held up very well, but looks quite different at seven months than fresh.    Pours a hazy yellow, with fine, soapy head.    Smell is full of dank hops, melon, a bit of pine and citrus, and just a slight hint of wood.    Taste follows the nose well, and amps up the dank melon a bit more and throws in some peach. Very long finish.    Mouthfeel is soft and pillowy, well carbonated.    Heady is a legend, and for good reason. This is just a superb beer and remarkably drinkble for the ABV.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Hazy apricot colored with huge whit pillowy head.    Aroma is dank and citrusy    Taste is something else. What is this? It tastes like no ipa I've ever had. It has a sweetness to it up front that I wasn't expecting. Finishes with a hard bitter bite.    Feel is dry, gritty and highly attenuated.    Overall great beer.

The smells hit your nose and you can really smell the citrus but it's not overwhelming. Tasting it makes you giggle. I'm not an expert but this was worth the hype. Now I'm hooked on unfiltered!

L: Not really sure as I'm drinking it from the can as per the directions on the can!  S: Hoppy, tropical fruit with pine resin escaping the can.  T: That is delicious! Citrus up front and dry, pine flavours on the end. Just invites another sip/gulp.  F: Dry and bubbly across the tongue.  O: Odd experience to be drinking a world-class beer from the can. Especially one so crushable. This one is not lasting long. The 8% alcohol is pretty well hidden. Awesome beer!

While there's a 4-pk holder in the box with a sticker showing a date of June 23, I don't know if it goes with this or one of the other 4 beers he sent me.    I disobeyed the orders on the can and poured it into a 16oz Boston Lager glass. No hiding it's unfiltered nature, this is an opaque, hazy tangerine color, with a big, fluffy eggshell-white head. All sorts of lace was left on the glass.    Citrusy hoppiness is the star element of this beer's aroma. This is a juicy smelling beer, and that juiciness is both bitter and sweet, with the bitterness in the driver's seat. If not a fan of big, bold grapefruity IPAs, This might not be the beer for you. There are sweet tropical fruit tones as well, however, plus some sweet, bready malt notes.    The bitter, citrusy hop aspect leads the charge in the taste as well. Midway through the taste, the sweeter fruitiness comes out to play. The finish is a little hot, alcohol wise, and a little syrupy for an IPA.    Medium-full body to this, with a fairly thick, creamy and resiny mouthfeel.    This is a big beer, no doubt about it. I was concerned it would be too much like a glass of beery orange juice, like some NE IPAs I've had that aren't my jam. This is more complex than that, with a nice, well-balanced mix of bitter and sweet. I'm not sure this is something I could session even if I was staying at home and not driving, as it has quite an impact on the taste buds, but it's delicious all the same. Really glad to have had a shot at this. Thank's, Jon!
