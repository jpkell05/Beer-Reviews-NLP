look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 It’s was a Christmas miracle for me today when I found this at my Piggly Wiggly. I’ve know about this beer for years but I could never find it in my area. What a Great Beer! Pours a crystal clear amber with great lacing. Smells of fresh pine and citrusy bliss. So smooth at first with a big hoppy bite you want in an IPA. Mouthfeel is outstanding with very light carbonation. 9.4%ABV is sneaky because this beer is so smooth and refreshing. Merry Christmas to all and to all a Great DIPA.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 Poured on tap...    Look:  Gold and clear. Sticky lacing.     Smell:  Sweet pine, nectar. Guava.     Taste:  Follows smell. One of the nicest, sweet and dank pine flavors. Hop bitterness. Citrus rind. Finishes dry.     Feel:  Good fizzy carbonation but not overdone. Med-light body.    Overall:  On the front end this is one of the nicest DIPA’s available if you crave big hops that lean sweet nectar-y flavors. It does have a bitter bite finish that lingers. I would return to this again whenever craving this particular profile.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Damn if that isn’t one of the freshest IPAs I’ve had in a long time. I thought the “enjoy by” thing on the front of the can might have been a gimmick, and surely this beer couldn’t be as good as the reviews say? But it was everything I could have hoped for, and more. Nice bright light copper-amber color with some foamy head and just a trace of spotty lingering lacing. Smells great, nice big bold citrus zest aromas with a little pine in the background. Tastes amazing. Loads of fresh citrus fruit - passionfruit, orange, tangerine, mango, grapefruit, lemon - as well as piney hops, floral hops, vanilla, bread and a great well-balanced malt backbone. So smooth, easy to drink and great mild mouthfeel. Just the right amount of carbonation. It’s additionally an imperial IPA but you’d never guess it since the higher ABV is well-hidden and the bitterness is just right, not too bracing, not too subtle. An outstanding beer and I will venture back to a local pub to sample this one on tap.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 [Original rating 2015-12-30] Draft at Horseshoe Pub, Hudson, MA. Aroma of citrus, a little pine. Taste is fresh citrusy hops, perfectly balanced with malt. Excellent IIPA.

Should have bought more because I only get there a couple times a year. Clear (no gassy yeast!), hoppy, a tad of sweet malt; this is one of their best. Don’t be scared of the monster on the can, just trust the masters at Stone and your Holloween will be perfect!

The smell is robust - pine and grapefruit - some alcohol.    The taste is of pine/resin with grapefruit. A sweet touch with spicy alcohol comes through. Rounded bitterness in the finish. Alcohol shows but doesn't overwhelm.    It has a rich, full body with a silky smoothness despite alcohol bite.    Another winner from Stone! A big DIPA - big on hops and malt that interplay with each other well. Nice!

I liked it better than the unfiltered Enjoy By, which had a garlic undertone (this one doesn't).    Look: Amber color, bubbly, with an inch thick white head    Aroma: grapefruit, mango, pine resin    Flavor: It's grapefruit, mango, floral hops notably significant pine resin, and despite the ABV 9.4% there's no alcohol taste.    Feel: Light-medium, fresh and juicy and refreshing

look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This beer's color absolutely radiates gold with a big foamy head, an absolutely gorgeous pour. Aroma is upbeat and citrusy, but nothing truly of note. Taste is smooth, dank but sweet with the expected hops bite. The big ABV and malt keep it mostly sweet at the back end of a swallow. Mouthfeel, again, is incredibly smooth. Delicious, but maybe a little too rich for more than one or two a sitting.

It approaches perfection like no other. A friend gave me two four packs of cans for my March 30th 70th birthday, which we drank on the use by date with other appropriate consumables--we were flying! I drank another can last night, more than three months past the use by date, and it was still absolutely superlative. Other than Dogfish 90, I prefer my strong IPAs lighter in color and this one is literally the light gold standard. Though it says its danky, I find its hop taste far from the dankiest. Rather its hoppy clear and true. I have one more can. I wish I had a case. It just doesn't get any better.

Smell from my tulip glass is ripe fruit, dank grass, the waft of alcohol and a touch of citrus. Taste is an intense depth of balanced malt, hop bitterness, carbonation and hop flavor. Finishes slightly sweet on the back end. They have done a nice job taking what could have been an overly intense beer and making it very drinkable. This is a great beer.

This big guy is probably my all time favorite. This beer is the quintessential example of what a double IPA should be. It is old school. It doesn’t chase fads. It focuses on hops. Brewers that have simply labeled unfiltered IPAs as “NE Style“ should take notice of this bad boy and bow down accordingly.

This brew is resiny as the dankest dank.     A bit over the top. Straight dankness is not what I look for in a fresh brew, especially as the main component.

Transparent orange amber color with thick creamy off-white head with good retention, the head gradually collapses to a long-lasting foamy crown and leaves some lacing behind clinging on the glass-side.    The aroma is purely a hop burst. Intense tropical, citrus, bitter orange, tangerine, peach, papaya, lime, dank, pine, and heavily resin that are back by sweet malt at the back end.    Fresh and intense hoppiness through the palate sensation, tropical fruit, citrus, bitter orange, tangerine, peach, papaya, lime, dank, pine, and heavily resin just like the aroma plus with solid bitterness lingering at the end. Malt is there too as the sweet support.    Medium body with some bold touch through the palate, the mouthfeel is smooth with rather low carbonation but proper to carry all the things well. Finish is typically dry.    Super fresh and devastatingly hoppy. Drink now as soon as you can.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Bottled 3/14/18. BB 4/20/18.    A: pours a bright, brassy gold with 1 finger bright white head and streams of small bubbles visible. Outstanding sheets of lacing.    S: piney citrus. A familiar resinous sweetness, with a lemony, citra undercurrent. Not terribly tropical, just resin and bright citrus.    T: slightly sweet, hoppy arrival. Fruity, juicy, citrusy, white bread middle. Lingering piney citrus hop bite. There's that vaunted dankness! Alcohol is well hidden, and given the highly drinkable texture, that is a dangerous combo.    M: I love the feel of this. Solidly midweight, but really clean, and with enough carbonation to keep it really lively on the tongue.    O: well, that certainly lives up to the hype. It is not really breaking new ground in its hop profile, but it is what I love - a classic style, perfectly executed. Furthermore, in what is kind of an insult to Stone, I think this is a really balanced beer. Certainly dominated by hops, but the sweetness of the malt stops it from being overbearing. Very nice. I'd say I'll buy it again, but I am getting old and can't hang with 9%-plus beers the way I used to. Really happy I finally got around to this.

Not as dank as I thought it would be given the date, but its there. Lots of mango and tangerine, though.  More dank in the flavor, lots more mango, not as much citrus. Bit of malt sweetness, and a clean, bitter finish.  A little stickier than I like, but not cloying.  There's a reason some breweries are so successful even when they're not chasing trends.

Aroma is a heavy but balanced whiff of danky and piney hops with citrus fruit. West Coast style amplified.    Taste follows aroma, but the malts come in here. Slightly less fruity than the aroma.    Mouthfeel is heavy, solid bitterness, but everything feels smooth with a clean, dry finish. Nothing lingering.    Overall, a very solid and strong West Coast DIPA offering from Stone. I find their regular IPA to be a bit too bitter; this one here, although much stronger, is far smoother and more balanced. Great price for a tasty, strong DIPA, also a plus.

Only a very slight haze happens upon an otherwise bright gold and amber color. A white, rocky topped foam has given decent coverage.     The aromatic density for this IPA is pretty stunning. Deep layers of several different hop effects pop out of the glass, earthy grapefruit, citrus blend, sweet and earthy....  The malt seems pretty hefty with some big honey and caramel aroma's . A hot/dry forest floor aroma is prevalent, dried leaves and maybe some golden wheat as well. There's a lot going on here.    The hop complexity becomes very clear with the first sip, whamo!! A hearty, crisp and earthy hop bite is impressive. Certainly a fresh, crisp and snappy overall feel and body. The sweet malty aroma really becomes much more crisp, light and bright in the flavor. A slightly bitter, metallic herbs and holden grains seem to seemlessly flow around eachother. Big earthy complexity, grainy, dry, citric and leafy come to mind from this combo of hops. The bitterness never gets too much, its in check but still delivers a bite. The 9.4 % abv. Is very well hidden and only adds to the depth and provides a nice warming effect. Earthy and dry citrus is the short version of this hop flavor, which is monsterously complex.    Stone still knows how to deliver the goods. Freeeesh.

Constant rising bubbles and a spotted lacing.    Aroma is mostly piney, grapefruit pith with a hint of spicy hops.    Flavor is dank, citrus grapefruit and a head-hitting sense, not flavor so much, just an understanding, of alcohol. The flavor of citrus hits the tongue first, thins to clear liquid, then explodes into "what did I just do?" dank alcohol.    Mouthfeel is both full and thin at the same time. At first the flavor fills the mouth and nose, intimidating the tongue, which, protecting itself, backs off while the feel thins, before the the back of the mouth and tongue remind you this is more than your regular IPA. Imperial, in fact.    Overall it is a very complex beer and I appreciate Stone's ability to produce it at such high volume.

Nice level of heat from the alcohol. Very drinkable.  Mouthfeel is medium and a touch sticky.

Was skeptical of the 'drink by' that the beer vendor was trying to sell me on but it does taste very fresh and the 10 different hops I found interesting.

It has always been my favorite IPA until now. Enjoy By has set a new standard in hops overload and freshness. I sweet, bitter tastes from beginning to end. Simply a refreshing beer that is amazing. If you like hops and quality beer, then look no further. This is the beer to get.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottled 9/24/17 poured into a teku glass at fridge temp 9.4% ABV. The beer pours bright light honey in color with a hint of orange. The head is off white, sticky and persistent. Lacing is prevalent. The aroma is pine, citrus and light honey. The taste is semisweet caramel, pine and citrus in classic west coast style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and bitter & dry in the finish. Overall, still outstanding. This EB 10/31/17 is the first I've tried in years. The last few times I had it (2015), I was overwhelmed with onion aroma that I could not get over. This is back on point.

Full and juicy nose with tangerine, kiwi, yuzu.     Orange and tangerine, juicy, resinous, and closes out with medium bitterness. It's on the dry side and the alcohol is well hidden.     Drying with soft carbonation.     It isn't as intensely hoppy as promised. It's a good double IPA that avoids being sweet or boozy.

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 First impression: Wow! Tasted from bottle. Pours a clear gold with white head. Huge aroma of citrus floral and pine. Excellent nose. Taste is similar to the nose with robust citrus and floral bitterness mixed with a mild caramel sweetness. It's all about the bitterness here though. Medium bodied with some nice stickiness to the palate. One of the best IPAs I've had. Well done guys!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 Nice head with constant bubbles rising. The smell is citrusy with definite pine and noticeable alcohol...but the overall impression is freshness. The taste is more grapefruit than the nose and the bitter hoppines just screams fresh. Feel is lighter than expected considering all the aromas and taste. Another winner from Stone.   
look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 5 L: Cloudy, orangish, frothy white head, much carbonation  S: Hops, hops, hops, a mix of citrus and tropical smells.  T: Follows the nose, an explosion of bitter citrus hops perfectly balanced with sweet tropical hop flavors.   HOP VARIETIES NUGGET, SUPER GALENA, SIMCOE, DELTA, TARGET, AMARILLO, CASCADE, GALAXY, CITRA, NELSON   SAUVIN, MOTUEKA & HELGA. Sound like overkill? It works. The taste is so fresh, amazingly creamy and   smooth, 90 IBUs, 9.4% ABV, and you would never know it, no alcohol taste. While I do not support limiting supply   to drive up demand, and I wish this was more widely available, the time limited smaller batch approach probably does   make a difference.  O: Awesome, it doesn't get much better than this.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 This actually isn't a single beer, but it would be quite the chore to put all the actual beers on here, and people have already been reviewing more than one on this page so why bother? I'm going to review multiple versions of this beer and just use the rating of the one I like best. So far, that is the first one.    From notes taken 04/19/17:    This is the Enjoy by 04.20.17 batch. Got to it in the nick of time!    Beautiful, clear bright orange, like a new penny. A steady stream of bubbles coming up from the bottom just add to the aesthetics. There’s a very fine and filmy off-white head, moderate retention, about what you’d expect for something this boozy and filtered and soft. Tangerine, mango, pineapple, cantaloupe, alcohol to smell. Yum, yum! Palate is very tropical as well but does a better job of blending all these distinct but similar elements together, and bringing the alcohol, some caramel, and more perfumy and rindy (grapefruit) hop qualities to the front. Excellent balance, far better than your average Imperial IPA, which I enjoy up to a point but always eventually have to start wincing at. Taste and feel both remind me somewhat of an American Wild Ale, there’s a rubbery quality to it right by the grapefruit rind, but this is nowhere near as sour. Extremely peppery retro-olfaction. Thanks for that, ethanol and hops, both! Deceptively light-bodied, and masking the heat further with abundant, tight, softer, but active carbonation. You eventually feel it all throughout your mouth and throat, though, it’s only a matter of time. 4, 4.75, 4.5, 4.25, 4.5.    From notes taken 06/11/17:    This is the Enjoy by 05.29.17    In fairness I have been too busy to review, or do much drinking at all. Hiking and camping trip, new job without quitting old job, spring cleaning. But I must apologize still for the lateness of this review, given the Enjoy by Date that is this beer’s name! Still, I am not too worried that will have deteriorated greatly if other beers in this series are any indication. I review 02.14.17 a month and a half late and it was still one of the best Imperial IPA’s I had ever had.    First pour is a crystal clear golden amber, looks like a pale lager apart form the head which is a fine and fluffy foam of the palest yellow with great retention. Grass, citrus rind or oil, faint apricot, alcoholic burn on nose. Palate is caramel, biscuit, and a little grain, more robust than nose, with a harsh soapy bitterness and an extreme peppercorn finish and retro-olfaction, but is otherwise the same flavors as aromas. Medium-bodied, very effervescent for the style and ABV, starting with abundant, fine, sharp prickles and finishing softer than velvet. Some heat from the ethanol if you pay close attention. Not as good as the other two I have had in this series yet (02.14 and 04.20), but that makes sense as this is more of a basic IPA than they were. I just picked up Enjoy by 07.04.17 an hour or so ago, I’ll try to review it in a more timely manner. 3.75, 4.25, 4, 4.25, 4.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Reviewed from notes. The appearance had a clear golden amber colored body with a one finger white foamy head that disappears at a moderate pace, speckled lacing clings a bit. The smell had a sweet yet bitter through pine, floral, hoppy, grapefruit tones. The taste had a bittersweet through previously mentioned flavors, grapefruit aftertaste, dry finish. On the palate, it sat at about a light to medium, semi-sessionable as the ABV seems to be well hidden, carbonated spot on. Overall, very nicely done IPA in a series that is always easy to come back to.

Served in a sniffer. Look is pale amber in color with about 3/4" of head. Pungent odor of hops and hops and hops with slight citrus quaffed around the hops. The imagery of hops soaked in a pool of zesty seltzer water came to mind. Taste seems to be a never ending profile of hops that flows in waves throughout. Complex indeed but so incredibly smooth and refreshing. Truthfully with the ABV and varieties used I anticipated it to be overbearing but in typical stone fashion, it was not. Incredibly smooth and balanced throughout and had a wonderful mouth feel that coated so well. I am extremely impressed by this IPA and encourage anyone to get one while its good.

Thin white head that lingers. Floral and tropical fruit aromas. Taste mirrors this, moderate amount of hops for the style, there are certainly more aggressively hopped IPAs. A delayed malt character presents itself to balance out the finish. Thick, lacy mouthfeel, can feel and taste this beer for about 20 minutes after finishing it.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 One of my favorite Enjoy Bys. Diverse hop profiles.    Poured a light golden color in a Spiegelau glass with a 4 finger head.  Excellent head retention. The head lasts few minutes.    Wonderfully floral bouquet. Spice.    Very carbonated, spicy.    Grape, citrus taste. Before warming, the taste is dominated by hoppy spiciness.  Grape and citrus, and a smoother MF come into play with warming. Spicy hoppy finish.    Overall, an excellent excellent+ beer.

Pours a very slightly cloudy medium amber color. 1 finger head that sticks around for a bit. Not a ton of lacing.    Aroma is great. Mangos, banana, pine, orange, lemon, wheat, peach, malts. Very fruity and creamy.     Taste is bitter grapefruit and smooth malts. Lots of citrus. Was expecting more fruit based on the nose but the bitterness dominates a bit.    Dry and bitter finish that makes you want to keep sipping.     Overall, a great DIPA. A bit too bitter for my taste but great nonetheless.

Unlikely that California beer made it by surface transport in two weeks.  Enjoyed from a local brewery tulip.    Golden, hazy appearance with 1/2 inch head which quickly dissapates to a persistent ring. Spotty lacing.  Citrus aromas, accompanied by characteristic Stone yeast note.  Grapefruit, mango, tangerine well balanced with the malts. Stone signature yeast melds with everything else in a harmonious unity.  Substantial body with dry finish. Not hot or boozy even as the 9.4 % ABV shines through.    I skipped at least two Enjoy By's prior to this one. Plenty of DIPA's available fresh these days. Really impressed by this vintage.

Strong but balanced nose of peppery, dank, and citrus hops. Taste is complex but redeeming with pale malt, citrus, pine, and dank hops with clean finish. Medium body and medium high carbonation with a perfectly subtle bitterness.  Fantastic IPA. Enjoy by 4/20 isn't over-hyped.

Pours clear golden without much haze, no sediment. A 1-inch foamy head that dissipated fairly quickly.  Smell is of fresh and pungent hops strong in grapefruit rind, citrus, tangerine, some peach, and a little bit of spice (clove?) and pine. Taste follows the nose and is more citrusy up front, then mid-palate has some grapefruit and other fruits with a combination of bitterness and sweetness, and there is a resinous and oily quality whereby it crawls into every part of the mouth supplying different notes in different places. Feels fairly full bodied with low carbonation. Sharply bitter in the back of the throat and finishes dry but doesn't linger too much, and somehow invites another gulp. Incredibly drinkable at 9.4% alcohol. I loved it.

A very balanced ipa with slight sweetness and piney hops. Hard to put a lot of notes on it as i just drank a 120 minute ipa (palate wrecker) for this abv, it is a great ipa.     Mouthfeel isn't thin, but more drinkable than some super high dipas.    Overall a very solid beer at 3 bucks per 12oz. If i wanted to pay more I'd go with double crooked tree (darkhorse) or the implication(odd side). They are a little heavier. I like my dipas at 11-13%    Btw, my chihuahua stole a sip and loved it. She stuck her tongue out and shaked with excitement. Smh....

Oh boy is this one tasty brew. usually dank doesn't do much for me, but this balance is devastatingly spot on. 37 days to the day after being bottled. the mix of hops hits this palate perfectly.     close to full on the mouth, slightly bitter and sour on the finish.     overall, this is one of the most dangerously drinkable 9.4's you will find. Since Stone orders me to "Enjoy by 4/20/17", I guess I'll have to drink the other one in the fridge tonight. poor me. :)

I am a little surprised that I have never reviewed this beer before now, but no time like the present, Happy 4-20 Day!    From the bottle: "Devastatingly Dank"; "Enjoy Now!"; "Brewed to be Enjoyed within 37 days"; "Live for the Now, the present."; "You have in your hands a devastatingly fresh double IPA. While freshness is a key component of many beers - especially big, citrusy, floral IPAs - we've taken it further, a lot further, in this IPA. You see, we specifically brewed it NOT to last. We've not only gone to extensive lengths to ensure that you're getting this beer in your hands within an extraordinarily short window, we made sure that the Enjoy By date isn't randomly etched in tiny text somewhere on the label, to be overlooked by all but the most attentive of retailers and consumers. Instead, we've sent a clear message with the name of the beer itself that there is no better time than right now to enjoy this IPA!"; "Our all-important, hop-driven quest to deliver the most devastatingly fresh IPA on the planet facilitated a paradigm shift in 2012 with the launch of Stone Enjoy By IPA. Not only did we brew this beer with more than 10 different hops, we brewed it specifically NOT to last.

Get your hands on this dank, golden beauty before everyone else gets wind of it."; "There is no better time than right now to enjoy this beer."    I Pop!ped the cap & debated as to an aggro pour or a gentle one. I went with the latter, followed by a vigorous in-glass swirl. This raised just under three fingers of dense, rocky, foamy, tawny head with good retention. Color was solid Amber (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like a bag of sticky, resinous dank had been dumped into my glass by way of the bottle! I rarely indulge as I have gotten older, especially while job hunting, but I can easily recognize the smell. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste had a unique bitterness, ranging from tropical fruit to bitter citrus fruit to resinous pine with a bit of cattiness thrown in for good measure! Whoa. I wonder why my hophead self never bothered to review this before, Finish was dry, hoppy & a good way to kick off 4-20 Day.    Praise be to Greg Koch & the rest of the Stoners! I have long been in Greg's ear about all sorts of wackiness, but at least their beers in CANs has come to fruition.     Yo, I'm about to drop the mic on some Enjoy By 07.04.17 in a CAN, yo!     From the CAN: "Defiantly Independent"; "Enjoy Now!"; "Brewed to be Enjoyed within 37 days"; "Our all-important, hop-driven quest to deliver the most devastatingly fresh IPA on the planet facilitated a paradigm shift in 2012 with the launch of Stone Enjoy By IPA.

No need to be gentle when the lees, particulate & flocculate are supposed to be in suspension. Two-plus fingers of dense, rocky, foamy, tawny head with moderate retention & I was there. Color was a deeply-hazy (but NOT cloudy) Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7). Nose smelled of ... pineapple?!? Wow. Actually, pineapple & ruby red grapefruit, which is just a little sweeter than standard grapefruit. Mmmph! I think that I just creamed my jeans. Mouthfeel was medium, light for the style. The taste was actually surprisingly sweet with pineapple being the primary & underlain by the semi-sweet grapefruit. 8=O Finish was only semi-dry, making it all that much more drinkable. This could be dangerous.

Beautiful fluffy off-white head that has some excellent retention.     S: Grapefruit, dank pine, leaf tobacco. Smells super clean if that makes sense. Refreshing to the point that having this after work seems brilliantly relaxing.     T: The grapefruit takes a back seat, the dankness of the pine shines out well. Leafy hop also shines strong too, this is very refreshing. Really impressive flavors.     F: Medium body, good carbonation that's crisp. Some hop oils remain on the tongue. Semi-dry but in this case its nice.     O: Wow this is just an impressive beer. Stone continues to blow me away.    Update: Got my hands on the next batch, Enjoy by 5/29 (Memorial Day) tasting this on 5/3/17, bottled on 4/22/17 so only 11 days old.     L: Same.     S: Same.    T: Same.

An aggressive pour yielded three fingers of white foamy head that was reminiscent of a root beer float. The mostly clear, rich coppery golden pour left thick and gooey lacing whenever I tilted the glass. The nose was strong and somewhat pungent, predominantly grapefruit and pineapple with an underlying base malt aroma. The taste, again a little pungent and fruity with moderate hop bitterness. There was an ascending grapefruit   bitter sweetness (that I haven't experienced or noticed in other IPAs) that quickly faded into a bitter finish. I would call it medium bodied and smooth and I found the carbonation was just about right producing only a slight tongue bite at first. Well done! I am looking forward to the next release

L: Beautiful amber color poured to YETI, medium sized white foamy head, good retention, solid lacing.   S: BIG HOPS! Bold and sharp aroma, fruity hops, grapefruit, herbal, mellow mango, very nice! Dank. Booze. Winner.   T: In my opinion, this is Stone's gold standard for DIPA. Flavorful, bold, strong, thick, exciting, fruity, dank, hop forward, pleasingly rich, lightly bitter pine finish, malt is just right. Bottle says "Devastatingly Dank", I agree. EJB 10/31/17 bottle says "Devastatingly Fresh", also agree.   F: Chewy liquid, medium to full bodied, resinous. Not too boozy for a 9.4 abv.  O: This is a big beer. Very unique and awesome, every sip an experience and keeps getting better throughout the session; one of those beers that you never want to end. I like the Tangerine version a little better, wish they would've made a batch this year... Also shared one of these with a friend; his first ever DIPA, and he really liked it; he didn't realize a beer could smell and taste like this... World class. Also paired very well with a Perdomo Craft Beer Series cigar! Life is good!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a tulip    Appearance: this is without a doubt the brightest beer I have ever tried. Golden with no haze whatsoever. The head is bright white with poor retention. The short duration of the head is what prevents this beer from scoring a 5 in appearance.    Aroma: dank hops. Pine and pineapple.    Flavor: mouth-coating lupulin. Super hoppy, oily. There is little malt backbone – just hops. The label states “10 different [hop] varieties”; there are no specific hop flavors. No specific fruit, pine, etc. No alcohol flavor or heat.    Mouthfeel: this is heavy-medium, heavy even considering the 9.4% abv.     Overall: damn tasty. This is far better than most of the 2X IPAs on the market. At $16.99 / 6-pack, perhaps the price exceeds the quality, but this is a damn tasty and worthwhile beer nonetheless.

L- Thick soapy slightly off white colored head that stands one finger tall,with good retention and sticky lacing.Hazy amber colored body with a gold hue,low clarity,and distorted light showing through the glass.Low amount of carbonation,light amount of sediment.    S- On the nose I get citrus hops consisting of mango and peach,with some pine and floral hops as well.There is also a nice dank aroma to this IPA.    T- The palate follows the nose with citrus hops up front ( mango and peach), floral and spicy hops in the middle,and a bitter pine hop punch on the back end.Dank after taste to it as well.    F- The mouth feel is medium with a sticky texture.Medium amount of oxidation on the tongue.Slightly dry yet smooth finish,with a somewhat chalky texture after the sip.    O- This is a very good IPA,I wish I had picked it up at an earlier date,it probably would have been even better.Can't wait for the next version to come out.Highly recommended to IPA lovers,and hop heads.

Taste is like a strong IPA that just keeps going. It is strong fruity and hoppy and the after taste is the same. Strong and smooth. Beautiful. A must for IPA lovers.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 A: [4.25] The bottle lists the ABV (9.4%) and there is a best by date 4/20 - duh. The beer is a cloudy amber color with 1 finger of white head.    S: [4.00] Big pineapple and dank notes. Peach and mango.    T: [4.50] Spot on. Mango, pne, dank resin, pineapple, orange rind, sweet malts.    M: [4.50] Thick and coating. Nice carbonation level. The bitterness is just right. It is there and lingers but is not overwhelming or distracting.    O: [4.25] I like the concept of making the name of the beer the drink by date. But it is not just a gimmick - this is a great beer. Tons of fruit flavor and aroma wrapped with dank notes. The body is nice and there is NO hint of 9.4% alcohol. Overall this is a fantastic IPA.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours a pellucid, reddish orange with an off-white froth. Wait, you mean it's not hazy!    Redolent with orange, citrus and pine.     Heavy on the hops up front of course, but plenty of fruit juice, caramel and spice to balance. And if that weren't enough, there's an encore wave of honey-like bitterness to finish.     Goes down medium and smooth, but you will not forget it's weight.     A complex and timeless DIPA for old school hop heads.

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 After having this beer on tap (today!), I believe this is easily the best IPA I've had so far.  It looks awesome in the glass, with a nice, dark golden orange color and a creamy head.  The smell is very tropical with citrus and pineapple right off the bat; the most wonderful hop aroma I've smelled so far.  The taste is exactly what you get in the nose, and the hop bitterness hits you in the front of the tongue but doesnt follow through to the back(which is nice), and the flavors invite you to sip some more (which I did!)  The feel is very smooth, not really heavy but not too light at the same time, very easy drinking for the 9.4%, which I couldn't even tell was there.  Overall, I'm glad that this was the first Stone beer I've tried, because we do indeed have Stone beers in Texas stores, yet I was afraid to try them. This is what a go-to double IPA should strive to be like. I'll definitely drink this again!

Citrus and strawberry and dank.     Huge taste. A big, juicy, citrus hop bomb with a malt center and a piney finish and aftertaste. A lot is going on here. This is delicious and is eminently drinkable at nine point four.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Look- 4.5-Gold color, slight haze, white head that lasts a little while, lots of lacing.    Smell-4.25- citrus hops, mango, apricot, peach, boozy. Sweet malt mixing with the hops, but hop forward. Clean ferment smell. Retronasal follows up with the dankness.    Taste-4.75- follows the nose, sweet citrus up front with sweet fruit like mango and melon following up with a boozy taste. Lots of complex hop flavor melding with the malt sweetness. Dank hop bitter lingers but not overpowering.    Feel-4.25- medium carb, over medium body without being too heavy for the style. Alcohol warmth builds as pallet warms up. A slight creamy carbonation feel, not spritzy.    Overall-4.5- one hell of an ipa! Will buy again and again. No question.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Possibly the best beer I've ever had. I don't write reviews much, but this one blew me away so much I had to say something. Has the most complex, intense IPA flavor. The usual grapefruit, pine flavor but just more...interesting.

Pours a slightly hazy honey gold with a white head. Smells of sweet citrus, hops, malt, some fruits, and herbs. Tastes of fresh hops, malt, grapefruit and orange zest, pine, and some other fruits. Medium resinous body with medium carbonation. Overall, wow, this beer is really incredible. Much better than the first time I tried it, probably because I can appreciate the subtleties more.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Look: Copper, clear, and well carbonated with a healthy head that sticks around.  Smell: Not a big aroma. Dank, earthy, and pine.  Taste: Dank, bitter, and bleeds hops.  Mouthfeel: Complex and a little boozy.  Overall: A great big west coast IPA for hop lovers.

The smell is fantastically strong from the moment the bottle is opened. Strong smells of tropical fruits, especially citrus like tangerines and oranges, some smell of peaches. Dank. Smells delicious. Taste is solid, hoppy bitterness from the start, not overpowering but it's there. Sweet and citrus, some pine notes, alternates a lot with the malts. Nice, medium body beer. Has a lingering bitterness to it. Overall its solid and nice, glad I grabbed a six pack, might get another one.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A clear amber orange with loads of carb rising, and a finger of white foamy head that sticks. In the aroma, I get lots of citrus (grapefruit, orange, lemon), a decent amount of the dank, but, not quite oniony vibe, and a nice touch of caramel malt. In the flavor, nice waves of hops and malts that alternate back and forth from sweet to bitter, ending with a pleasant bitter note. Dank is mostly what I'm picking up in the flavor, which is great, but, I think the nose gives off a little more in the way of the citrus. Still, a very tasty brew. The feel is, above average carbonation, full feel, a little oily up front, and, quite dry on the finish. I can see why it's in demand. Nice stuff.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Enjoyed the 4.20.17 release of this. Lots of tangerine, clementine, and other lower-citrus citrus.

Not much later than that date can alter the overall feel and integrity of the beer.

Look is a fantastic light golden haze with bubbles and awesomeness. Smell is like I'm peeling a grapefruit or maybe an orange or maybe a star fruit/grapefruit/orange/tangerine/mango-hybrid. Just incredible. Taste is basically the same as the smell. Just outstanding. Seriously world class stuff here. As far as west coast American IPA's are concerned this is the cream of the crop. Mouthfeel is just outrageous. Crisp, clean, smooth, thick enough to really set the flavors into your tastebuds, light enough to wash away after a moment or two after swallowing. Overall this is probably my favorite beer of all time, and each iteration is just a new and exciting version to sample, every time a new enjoy by comes out it's a nice diversion to a different aspect of the original profile without changing so much as to be unrecognizable as an enjoy by. I look forward to each one, especially the unfiltered editions. Thank you stone!!

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Enjoyed 44 days after brewing, so this isn’t quite as fresh as Stone had intended.    Appearance: Pours amber-golden in pint glass, with heavy white suds but with a small head and little lace.    Aroma: Brilliant tropical hops, with citrus, pineapple, mango…absolute hoppy bliss!    Taste: Strong on the bitter note, with tropical hops yumminess emanating through. Definitely a potent imperial IPA, with bitterness lingering in the finish. A stunning IPA and wholly delicious.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I've had many iterations of this long running IPA series. Six in total, ranging from 10.31.14 to 10.31.16. My favorite was 04.20.15 which was had the best overall aroma and flavor. My rating of 4 is the combined score from all six I logged on untappd. In my opinion, this serious has run over due. It was a great idea, and they've proved their point. Its time to move on to bigger and better things.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Look: Brilliant and crisp golden orange color. Not a huge head like expected. 1-2 finger head with a fairly rough pour. Head dissipates rather quickly, but has a nice 1/4 inch of bubbles continuously being replenished.    Smell: Not overly aromatic, but has some funk, pine, juniper, and citrus. Quite a Catty aroma.    Taste: A decent hop bite upfront. There is a battle between sweet malt and bitter hops. The hops burst first with peach, pineapple, and pine. There is definitely more cattiness in flavor than in the aroma. The bitterness backs off and then more malt flavors come through.     Feel: Light-Medium bodied. Felt a bit thinner than most IPAs.     Overall: Great IPA. Not the best, but very good. Not the biggest fan of Catty hop IPAs, but this one is well balanced with other flavors.

Look - A gold with a nice white head.    Smell - I detected a nice punch of fruits, mostly oranges and pines.    Taste - The taste is very similar to the smell.    Mouth feel - A quick kick and it was enjoyed.    Overall - I like the fact that they brew dates that are expected to be drunk before a certain day. This pleases me because it gives you a fairly obvious "drink before date" to experience the best of what the beverage has to offer.

Not much lacing from this one.    Smell is mostly grapefruit and some pine blended with it. The pine starts to become stronger after it settles.    The taste goes along with the smell with grapefruit and citrus followed by the pine notes. A little sweetness in there and the alcohol starts to come through. Tasted better about the halfway point.    More complex fell than I expected. The hops finally kicked in with some nice bitterness in there. All of it balanced nicely.    A great beer to have fresh. Not sure this one would age well.

Defying the laws of retail beer distribution, the Stone Brewing Company delivers this release with a label displaying an enjoy by date not far from when some lowly clerkboy stocked the beer. Now, I'm not sure why anyone would buy a case of 4 6-packs and not be able to drink all of it in one night but for such plebians it is probably recommended you stick to more layperson varieties such as Coronas which, from personal experience, can be drunk a good five years from purchase date (a single bottle half-drunk was found behind my fridge after cleaning out my condo and still tasted fine). However, if you're into a fresh boozy beer with a flavor of manufacturing plant still in the bottle you have the King right here.

Unfortunately bit of a sweet booze note to it as well but that is little tough to avoid in a beer this big. Definitely dank and resinous as advertised. Not a favorite but for a beer that is as available as this series, pretty damn good.

Aroma is a burst of citrus and pine, very nicely balanced.     Taste contains many traits of an excellent IPA, all contained in one beer! Pine, citrus and malt are present right off the bat. The citrus have a sweet, candied quality to them. Good amount of bitterness on the back end, with a dry finish. Definitely has a stronger malt presence than you'll typically see in IIPA's, but its a welcome addition.    Medium bodied and disturbingly drinkable for its ABV.    AFter hearing about this beer for a long whole and finally managing to get my hands on one, it definitely lived up to the hype.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Enjoying the Enjoy By 07/04/2016! Actually...enjoy sounds like an understatement. This IPA is fabulous!!  Pours a brilliant bronze and orange color. Nice thumbnail foam head. The lacing is ever present and semi sticky. An attractive drink for sure.  The aroma covers the spectrum of fruity flavors with a constant undertone of biscuity malt. Mangoe, pineapple and all sorts of tropical goodness hit the nose. Midway, the citrusy tones( I'm thinking grapefruit pith) provide some zest. The resiny hop oils add some pungency.  The tropical and citrusy fruit are most noticeable the first half of the drink. Also, the caramel malt backbone is present. Although there is lots of sweetness, the prevalence of hops truly takes over halfway. Citrusy hops, sharp pine needles, resin, herbal aftertaste. Overall, this is a big juicy and hoppy IPA, however, there is some dryness that keeps you wanting more. The body is medium, smooth, the carbonation is soft. So drinkable it's scary! Truly delicious! One of the best! World class!

This one comes off as all over the place, when i think the aim was "complex". It is very hoppy, very layered...good enough mouthfeel. Little boozy. Little chewy. I think in 2016 this is only a slightly above average double ipa. I do appreciate this release, and happy stone continues to do it. They are never "bad" and always interesting. Im just not sure it needs 27 hops      Edit- i noticed someone else said better from bottle than poured, i agree. My grade from bottle would be solid 4/5   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours a very lightly hazy pale copper in color with a finger of white head. Very hoppy, pine, some citrus, and a bit of tropical fruit. Taste follows the nose and is hugely hoppy, the flavors are somewhat less distinct than the aromas but tropical fruits are more pronounced here but pine and citrus are still present. I get a bit of booze here as well but it's not unexpected given the 9.4% ABV. Good mouthfeel, medium bodied and moderate carbonation. Overall a very good beer but I will say that I found it far more enjoyable straight from the bottle as opposed to from a glass.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Over 3 days, I've had 3 of these already. I think that says a lot. Looks damn near perfect for a DIPA: bright, golden amber body, mostly transparent, with a foamy 2 finger head. Head dissipates down to a thin layer of foam and a little swirl of the glass stirs up a surprisingly thick layer of foam. Even the last couple ounces still produce more head than some beers I've tried when first poured! Smells of strong, bitter citrus fruits and a hint of pine. Taste is predominantly grapefruit, tangerine, orange, and lemon. I'm getting both the juices and the rind of each fruit flavor. There's some strong pine bitterness buried beneath all the citrus fruit, and a little bit of candy like sweetness way in the background. This is a great marriage of sweet and bitter, really embraces the west coast style of strong bitterness and is much more balanced than some of the east coast DIPAs I've had. Feel has a really nice drying effect from the hop oils, and feels full bodied and with medium carbonation. The one downside of this beer is it gets the tiniest bit harsh as it warms. I drank one relatively quick and the next day let it sit a little longer, and the last few swallows of the one left to sit out had a much more noticeable alcohol presence. Otherwise, this is an awesome DIPA and I'll be on the lookout for the next batch.

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5 Look: Golden, with a large head that slowly dissipates. Good lacing as well.    Smell: A strong grapefruit aroma is noticeable the second the cap is removed. After the pour I get strong grapefruit and lemon aromas, with just a little bready malt. I also get a distinct smell of grapefruit slices (the gummy candy). Just a little bit of bitterness comes through as well.    Taste: A mild piney bitterness hits up front for just a brief moment before giving out to a balance of bready malt and citrus flavors. Grapefruit shines through the most, along with lemon, tangerine, and some elderflower-like floral notes. Finishes with a mingling of tropical fruit, pepper, and just a vague lingering bitterness.    Feel: Medium bodied, and low-to-medium carbonation. very smooth.    I never quite understood what people meant when they called beer “juicy”, but I think this is what they're talking about. I was blown away by how good it was. An incredibly well balanced beer, and an absolute pleasure to drink.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Reviewing the Fourth of July 2016. On tap: pours a clear, honey-golden body with a bright white head with good retention. Aromas are lively and potent: huge hops are predominantly citrusy with a healthy dose of pine, and tropical fruit notes like pineapple and papaya feature strongly as well. On the palate initially sugary and pineapple juicy before an electric jolt of hippiness rattles the mid-palate. Finishes with a nice fruit-salad like quality, with some hop oil lingering to remind you of the beat down delivered by the bitterness. A fantastic beer.

I will enjoy this right now. And just that I did. Forget all the stuff I could go into. The appearance? Beer. After that, everything else is just hops, on hops, on glorious and magnificent hops! The nose hits you in the face like there is a little mysterious being inside this beverage showering you with a firehose of lupulins. It completely covers your palate in delicious hop flavors like glitter off a strippers tits. At that point you're done. You know how it finishes? Hops. It's fresh. It's smooth. It's all things Stone. I suggest they change the name to "Enjoy by tomorrow" because that's about how long this should last in your fridge. #reviewsofbrews #stone #stonebrewery #stonebrewing #stonebrewingco #stonebrewingcompany #beer #hops #humuluslupulus #ipa #stoneenjoyby #stoneenjoybyipa #stone20   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Stone is back in WI and I get to have my first ever Enjoy By! 7.4.16 bottled about a week ago. Poured 12oz bottle into snifter. A clear dark gold with streams of bubbles ascending to the 3 finger white pillowy head. Retention is amazing and leaves a cap with very thick lacing on my glass. Aroma is very fruity with some nice citrus and dank hops. Sweet tropical notes. Flavor is more tropical and juicy with faint notes of bubblegum and a bitter finish. Feel is medium with an oily feel, but slightly dry on the finish. I had no idea this was close to 10% ABV! What a treat, glad to finally try one.

The fact that this is a iipa really surprised me because it was extremely easy drinking. I tried it on tap in Champaign IL with my graduate so it was even that much better!

The taste has much of the fruit and straight bitterness of their mix of hops. There is a slight green taste in the glass. Certainly a slick feel and syrupy amount of malt. The body is a little on the thinner side and carbonation medium at best. Neither detract anything from the beer; they allow the hops and all of their glory show through. This was the latest incarnation, 4-20-16. Each release seems to be close to the same recipe, IMO.

Aroma- TANGERINE! citrus, juicy (smells juicy), lost of fruit ester going on, Piney, Spicy, catty ammonia, and lots of hops    Taste- Started mild due to the temperature of the pour, smooth and easy bitters. as it warmed it became very earthy, dry, piney, dominated by tangerine and fruity juicy palate, nectar    Aftertaste- SO DRY, i liked that. Crisp, malty smooth, almost had a faint sweetness, assertive alcohol presence as it warmed    Mouthfeel- Clean, medium body, medium carbonation, clean, but unfiltered lingering flavors    Overall- Holy DIPA! Intense ale not for the faint of heart or beginner craft beer consumer. Alcohol and fruit flavors overwhelm the palate especially as it warms.

The nose is medium in intensity; it leads with biscuity malt, which is quickly overridden by a nice blend of grapefruit and cannabis with hints of perfume and tamarind. Alcohol overtones are deceptively slight. Up front, the palate is medium-bitter pineapple and nutty, caramelly malt; mid-palate, the biscuity malt foundation presaged by the nose shows itself prominently, and the hops expand to include grapefruit notes and a bit of grassiness. Perceived bitterness rolls back to moderate in the face of the malt onslaught, and alcohol undertones are considerable. The finish is a good hit of boozy, nutty caramel, and is modestly astringent; the linger is a surprisingly modest resinous pine bitterness that lasts for awhile. Mouthfeel is on point for the medium body, and is moderately astringent; the texture is slightly creamy and medium-peppery from the well-expressed carbonation. (12 oz bottle, 20 days after pkg, 17 days before best-by)

Head is bright white, has great retention, and leaves thick lines of lace spread out around the insides of the glass. Very dank, resin smell. Lots of fresh tropical fruit, mango, pineapple, and grapefruit. Taste and smell go hand in hand. A lot of juicy tropical fruits. This one is an easy drinker, crisp, and refreshing. Amazing offering by Stone, decent price and readily available, this is world class.

Now I can see why. The hops are perfectly displayed-pineapple, mango, orange, tangerine, grapefruit. I thought the pine and dank were in line with the rest of the hop's flavor components. The grapefruit and subtle resin kick up in the finish, lingering just a bit. The overall bitterness is moderate at best. It starts low and slow, peaking in the finish. But even the finishing bitterness is mellow enough that you don't think twice about going in for another sip. The hoppy bitterness is softened by pleasantly sweet, and light bready malts. There is some caramel in the malt as well. The malt is always present providing the perfect balance needed for a world class beer, which this beer is. I really enjoy the body of this brew too, smooth and slightly coating/creamy. Alcohol is well covered, which makes this a dangerous beer. All of this contributes to a well balanced, harmonious, super drinkable brew. If you have the opportunity, don't pass on it. This is truly a must have if you are an IPA fan.

Smell is floral, pine and citrus. Taste is dominated by grapefruit, a slight sweetness, balanced by a hint of pepper, and then a bitter pine finish. Very dry mouthfeel, well carbonated. A very good beer.

Aromas consists of tangerine and grapefruit, and slightly piney.    A solid hit of grapefruit on the tongue initially, supported by a thin layer of biscuit and caramel sweetness. Finishes with a strong dose of piney hop bitterness.    Dry with a medium to heavy body. Medium carbonation and just a hint of heat from the alcohol.     This is another solid and enjoyable brew from Stone.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 The beer poured a lovely shade of golden, with one a crystal clear body. The head was a little small, barely measuring at one finger thick. The aroma was very dank, smelling of grapefruit and pine resin. The taste was superlative. I was blown away by the assault of the dank piney and citric hops strong enough to strip teeth enamel. The hops were backed by simple pale malts that provided just a touch of sweetness. This was a sticky hop bomb, and coated my tongue, and throat going down, providing a long lingering hop aftertaste. The alcohol was well hidden, making this very drinkable despite the near double digit ABV. This is an essential beer if you are a hophead. I thought I had already reviewed it before now, but I was wrong about that. You can bet this is going to be a go to purchase for me from now on.    04.20.2016 edition, enjoyed on 04.09.2016   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Up there with the best, one of the most wine-like beers I have ever tasted.     4.20.16 edition, bottled on 3.15.16, enjoyed on 4.08.16.    A- Pours a clear, deep golden, with initial, cascading carbonation streaming up the glass. A white, billowy, two finger head caps and leaves butterflies of lace.     S - The nose is and floral hops with notes of juicy orange, tangerine, and lemon rind. Almost Belgian white pepper - yeast vibe too.     T - Resinous and bitter hops dominate, with rounds of flavors (per the aroma - citrus colors) that resolve in a peppery and malty finale. Complex and wine-like. Drink slowly out of wide tulip and savor.     F - Finishes with alcoholic bite, with a dry, warmth from its 9.4% ABV. Glowing and brandy like.     One of my favorite beers.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.5 Enjoy by 04.20.17  Quite similar to last year's, in fact I can't pinpoint much change at all, happy this comes out around my Birthday (04/14).  Enjoy!    Enjoy by 04.20.16  I suppose it's the glass we poured into, or the temp, because the last pack I got of these would have ranked much higher, haha higher. But unlike the last this one has an astringent tinge with semi present alcohol taste. Low carbonation and pleasant bitterness that hits the sides of the tounge and roof of the mouth. I feel a slight bit more carbonation could go a long way in hiding the alcohol. Wish I could say that I'll be buying it again someday.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 4.20.16 version.    Look (4): A golden yellow and orange tangy looking brew. Exactly what I'd say the sun set looks like. Kind of hazy. A big white heady that is cloudy like in color and froth.    Smell (4): It's like opening a door in your refrigerator that's been holding fresh tangerines and peaches. It's got a lovely citrus and tropical aroma as well as some bacog round caramel malt aroma. Also a very dank weed smell is evident through the whole smelling process.    Taste (4.25): Tropical cut up peaches and pineapples are being thrown at my face. It's clearly got more then one specific hop used in it and the dankness clearly takes hold and doesn't let go. A malty backbone definitely helps a bit with balancing this out, but it's definitely a hop heads dream brew.    Mouthfeel (3.75): It's like licking a fruit with fuzz and then while pulling your tongue away you end up with some cream texture on it. It's definitely lighter bodied then I remember the last version... the aftertaste is never ending #thisiswhybeerisbetterthenwine    Overall (4): A solid 4. Nothing will ever be as good as when you have it the first time around, but I definitely remember the last version being a bit more full bodied and malty.

I wanted Devastatingly Dank, what I got was disappointingly dunce. However, still good. Just not nearly as good as previous editions, especially that last unfiltered masterwork they served up. That one was so good I didn't even want to drink it. I hated to see it go.  This one is lacking in body, floral and smoothness. Maybe I was looking forward to it too much and it could not live up to my own hype. Left a coarse feel on palate and went down kind of grainy. Did not have that creamy feel to it that I've come to expect.   It cost me as I bought 2 six packs of it. I'll get around to drinking it. I had 4 Southern Tier 2XSMASH in fridge that put this Enjoy By to shame.   I drank that instead. I still will be there for the next batch but this one left me wanting. The beer just came off as nothing special, just an average DIPA.  Hey I'm already over as the Great Lakes Chillwave has just dropped:)   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 4.20.16 edition, enjoyed on 4.06.16    Pours a clear golden yellow, with moderate carbonation streaming up the glass. An off-white, billowy, two finger head caps it off, fizzling away leaving excellent lacing.    The nose is full of pine and floral hops with notes of orange, tangerine, grapefruit peel and lemon rind. There's a whiff of white pepper too.    When you drink this beer; resinous and unrelentingly bitter hops assault your tongue - scrubbing your taste buds - but ultimately paving the way for a crisp, light and well balanced, graham crackery, malt sweetness.     There's a touch of vanilla for a moment. Then juicy hops akin to the taste of nectarines, grapefruits and oranges reassert themselves and meld with the vanilla for a deliciously sweet, yet still bitter, orange creamsicle flavored ice cream float type of taste.    Mouthfeel is heavy and sticky. Finishes with a healthy alcoholic nip and a dry, delightful warmth to it. You can tell it's 9.4% ABV.    Overall it can be a little too bitter at times, and the mouthfeel is rather heavy and not what I would call thirst quenching, but it's a damn good IIPA.

This was the first enjoy by that I have ever had, and maybe it's due to high expectations, but this beer fell short for me. Honestly I had this with another beer because I was like "Really? This is it?" and wanted to compare to something I've had multiple times before. After thinking about it though, I realized I just didn't like this much. It looks great, and smells even better, but the taste and mouthfeel were really lacking for me. I ended up pouring out probably 4-6 ounces of it.

White pepper and soft grapefruit.  M: Light-medium body. Drinks lighter than ABV would suggest. Soft bitterness and subtle citrus sweetness. Mildly dry throughout.

Less fruity than a New England double IPA  Taste is clean, well balanced, not bitter, but not fruity. Stretching it, a sense of a good Scotch and water with some effervescence.  Nice, but not notable feel.  Overall, very good double IPA. Very drinkable.

OK not really.......  At first taste "crisp" would be the word. Hoppy?? Oh yes !!  Easy to drink ..which is dangerous at 9.7 % but HEY ! I'm not driving right now, so be it !!    Stone ..... In my subjective opinion, the beer made it to NJ still crisp fresh hoppy and drinkable.  AND for 9.7 and be drink-able?? I'll bet at the staff meeting the beer masters went:  "We're gonna get a few people toasted on this" HEHEHEHEHEHheheheh"    And ... And ...   4-20-2016 ??    COME ON man !!! Really........ 4/20 ?!!?!!!  Some dudes just bought it because it just says 4/20 (LOL!)    ANYWAY   Asking for the "feel " of the beer like in my other reviews is still personal !!

Pours a gorgeous, clear gold with a thin white head that becomes a collar rather quickly. The lacing is spotty and webbed. Aroma is one area where Enjoy Bys typically shine and this is no exception. A lively bouquet of grapefruit, honey, malt, and citrus. The flavor is hop forward but does so mildly, with a round finish consisting of more grapefruit, melon, earth, and rich malt. The finish is wet and clean with a long bitter touch. The hops are not overdone and mix well with the rest of the palate. A great IPA.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a bottle not even 2 weeks old all the way over here in Beaumont, TX. 4/20/16 version woo hoo! Pours a slightly hazy medium gold ale color with the tiniest bit of carbonation. Smell is piney resin drops of dank if that makes any sense, and the taste follows suit with a bold refreshing flavor that quickly opens up your pallet but hides the 9+% deviously well. For some reason it wasn't kept refrigerated by HEB. Great job Stone, concept is a very welcome one in this craft beer market where many a retailer overstocks, ruining beers in the process.

I can't think of a better DIPA regularly distributed in a bomber. Even better that it has come down in price in NorCal...bombers are now $5.99. Can't beat the QPR. Tasty for days!    A, 95

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a golden yellow, which is quite lovely. Head is foamy and white and retains well. Lacing is tight and everywhere. Tangerine, citrus, and dank hops form a juicy, hoppy aroma. Nice juicy dank and piney hop flavors with a bit of citrus and tangerine to back it up. Good balance, which leans on the bitter hoppy side. Mouth feel is a bit harsh on the carbonation side, but otherwise manageable. Not as full as other IPAs either. Overall, a good solid IPA. Didn't deliver as well as I thought it would (my first Enjoy By), but it's still quality.     Served in a 12oz snifter. Bottled March 14th. Drank March 26th. Enjoy By 4/20/16 version.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Enjoy By 04.20.16 bottled 03.15.16    Easily the best DIPA that i've had since I got turned onto the style, comes in an absolutely beautiful bottle that you really can't wait to open upon first sighting it in the store. I had the pleasure of spotting one in the singles cooler at my local bottle shop, have waited until i've had a few to give it a review. Pours with a thick white head which settles into a gorgeous thin layer of foam on top of this golden beauty. The smell of tropical fruit is strong and helps mask the massive 9.4% alcohol that you're about to consume. Lifting the glass to your lips, it starts with intense hops and bitterness, finishing dry and boozy as it goes down. Adjusting to the bitterness, you really start to get the citrus notes coming through and it turns into a truly amazing DIPA from a truly amazing brewery.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured a nice golden color into my snifter glass. The nose is perhaps a little muted but there is some soft citrus aromas coming through. The taste is better than the nose showed with strong citrus and tropical flavors going on here. The mouthfeel is smooth but there is a little bit of alcohol burn in the back of this. And since this was really fresh it is a better than average beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 4.20.16, opened the first bottle a couple weeks ago, this is holding up fine with a couple weeks before the EB date.    Look is clear copper body with decent, off-white head. Dissipates rather quickly leaving some spotty lacing and a thin ring.    Smell is very piney. Dank and resinish, this is dominated by the hops early, with no sign of malts on the nose,    Taste is similar to the nose, except you get a biscuity, bready flavor rather early in the taste. It works really well with the sharp bitter notes. Citrus notes are somewhat hidden, but easily detected when you pay attention.    Feel is excellent, not too heave - which is how I think an IPA should be - but plenty of malt to balance out the hops. Very sticky, long finish. Great!    Overall, you can't go wrong with this one. Its in your face, but well rounded. Alcohol is not prominent, but this is still going to be a huge beer for anyone that doesn't have big beers regularly.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 4-20-16. As I've come to expect from this series..., a great looking, smelling and tasting IPA from Stone. Crystal clear, an inch of head, wonderful lacing. Tropical and citrus hops, a sturdy enough malt backbone and just enough bitterness in the finish. Love it.
