look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Pale amber color, brilliantly clear Pours a white head, moderately sized, but tightly bubbled and long lasting for a 9% beer.    Thick malty aroma with a creamy sweetness. Hop aroma is there, but somewhat muted. Hints of alcohol in the nose.    Big hit of malt, hops, and alcohol right off the bat. Malt gives way to hop flavor (mostly pine to me) and alcohol as it progresses. Overall a fairly nice balance that shifts slightly hoppy late. A more unified flavor profile than many DIPA examples.    Med-full body and medium carbonation. Has a fairly smooth mouthfeel, and just a bit of alcohol warming on the backend.     A style that generally isn't my cup of tea, but a pleasant and drinkable example from DFH. I think it would be better as an 8% beer with less alcohol in the flavor, but I don't get to make those decisions.

Thin white head disappears quickly leaving a ring around beer and glass.  Hoppish scent that was slightly more than a malty nose with a bit of alcohol.  Taste is truly one of a kind. As an imperial ipa you would think was piney or bitter. Not at all. Depending on your taste, great or disappointed. I enjoy the crispness of the hops with this smoothness of the malt. A very clean finish with a tingly carbonation at the end.   For an imperial this has a light mouth feel. Very drinkable with rich easy slight alcohol finish.  A true ipa fan will probably be dissatisfied with this but I found it to be a great, refreshing beer regardless of where it fits in the beer spectrum.  I was treated to this beer on tap in the Summer of 2016. With good friends and conversations, I lost track of the refills ( very generous friends) but I do remember how amazing this beer tasted on tap. Always on my tap radar!

It poured nicely and had an appealing amber color. However the smell was surprisingly weak, it does not smell hop-heavy at all to me, compared to many beers I’ve had before it honestly barely has a smell. The taste is good but again, surprisingly weak tasting. I was disappointed since I was craving something with a strong flavor so I searched for reviews and was surprised to find it rated so highly on this site. It’s not a bad beer but with all the great options out there it’s certainly not one I would recommend over others.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Pours a very clear, copper color with lots of bubbles and a minimal head that dissipates quickly.     Aroma is piney with some grapefruit and lots of caramel malt. In fact, the malt aroma overwhelms the hops.    Taste is also very malty with some of the dank hop flavor sneaking through. Very strong malt backbone which is so different from today's IPA's.     Mouthfeel is medium with a decent amount of bitterness. Actually, just about the perfect amount of bitterness.    Overall, I prefer my IPA's to tilt in the favor of more hops, less malt. However, I did rate this beer higher (even though it's not my favorite) because it is exactly what they were going for and they executed it flawlessly.

Aroma is caramel, faint vanilla swimming pine, citrus, floral and fruity hop notes. Taste is caramel malt sweetness balanced with pine and citrus hops with a hint of apple/pear in the finish. Starts sweet; finishes dry and bitter. A good example of an early American craft Imperial IPA.

The aroma is grapefruit zest, orange peel, blood orange, pine cone, caramel, mineral water, honeycomb, pine sap, pine needle.  The taste follows the nose pretty closely with lots of pine needle and pine sap, crystal sweetness without cloy. Caramel and biscuit. Some citrus presence through orange zest, grapefruit, and blood orange essence. Zesty and bitter citrus rather than juice, with the pine most forward. Crisp and clean overall. A hint of alcohol warmth. Quite bitter, with lingering citrus bitterness. Dangerously drinkable.  Medium-plus mouthfeel, smooth and and oily and highly carbonated.  Sets the standard for old-school IPA, unremarkable but well-made. A solid beer.

This is leaning towards Russian Rivers all time favorite Pliny the Elder Double IPA in its rich, slightly heavy taste. Excellent.

Clearish orange color with a two finger head, smells of piney, fruity, floral hops. The taste is unfamiliar and dark at first, but settles to a sweet and bitter tropical taste. Very floral and hoppy on the aftertaste. A thinner mouthfeel than expected but with moderate carbonation. IPA is not my favorite style, but DFH did a damn good job on this one. Truly a classic brew, highly complex but balanced.

Lacing is beautiful.    S: Smells bright and hoppy, but a balance of piney, grassy, fruity hops. There's a floral sweetness, some island fruits, pomelo,     T: Wow. When they say that there's a malt backbone, they weren't kidding. Perfect balance between the hops and malt, shining together in perfect harmony. There's a creaminess, richness, caramel, nuttiness, spices, sweetness, and a whole lot of flavors I can't quite pick out.    O: One of the best imperial IPAs I've had. This one knocks it out of the park in so many ways. So drinkable for 9%. This is both complex, yet approachable beer.

Appearance: Deep rich copper color with two fingers of off white head.  Aroma: Sweet malts up front followed by a pleasant but somewhat restrained dank hop aroma. There are some sweet tropical fruit aromas as well, such as pineapple and mango. Overall, 90 Minute is wonderfully aromatic and juicy.   Taste: The nose would led one to believe that this was going to be more malt driven, however, the first sip reveals a very balanced relationship between the hops and malts. Sticky and resiny Pine hop flavors come out on the taste more as well. While it is balanced, there is a big sweet bread malts character to combat the intense hopping this beer gets. Tropical fruits from the aroma are here as well, but are harder to nail down to a specific fruit. As the beer warms, it gets sweeter and stickier and exhibits a nice full palate coating mouthfeel.  Biased comments: Its a classic, what else can I say that hasn’t been said. Its a totally enjoyable palate wrecker, that is perhaps a tad too sweet, but has a place in my fridge anyway. Also, its now in six packs.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Look - poured from a 12 oz bottle. Light copper in color, a small half-inch head with lacing.  Smell - surprisingly, malts first, then hops. slightly sweet. would not think this is an imperial IPA just from the smell alone.  Taste - once again, a dominant malt presence that is supplemented by strong, but not overpowering, hoppy flavor. a fairly sweet finish, with a bit of warmness in the end from the booze. a really nice experience.  Feel - medium bodied, light to moderate carbonation, and heavy on ABV at 9%. however, alcohol is well masked and not too detectable, especially when cold.  Overall - a really, really good beer, and a thoroughly enjoyable IPA. Unlike the trend of current craft IPAs, 90 Minute's malty backbone has always made it an extremely balanced beer, and easily approachable by many. A great go-to beer for any occasion.

Taste and feels amazing, never had anything better and I've been drinking beer since I'm 13. Now I'm 38 and I've had hundreds of different ipas. Dog fish had 90 minute imperial ale is hands down the best craft beer. FOR a session beer I go with yuengling lager.

look: 4.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 12 Oz Bottle poured into glass  Look - Mostly clear, rich amber color. Thick foam head trickles away leaving good lacing on glass  Smell - Bottled only a month ago but not much of an aroma. Malt and some floral hops. A Belgian note.  Taste - Powerful flavor. Malt is the main thing, like biscuits and french toast but the hops are very present as well. Fairly sweet. Extremely well balanced, not much bitterness and cannot pick up the alcohol much even at 9% ABV. Carbonation is medium-low.  Certainly a medium-heavy body, not a beer that will be good for parties. The thing i like about the hop profile is that it isn't really grapefruit, its more earthy, piney, oily.    Overall, a really good brew. Not as bitter as I was expecting but pleasant drinking and smooth. Good beer for dessert. Will be buying it again at some point. Grade is an A

Nice amber color with just a little head and minimal lingering lacing. Smells great, nice fruity hops. Tastes of citrus and floral hops, caramel, grain and a great malt backbone. Very little bitterness. The hops flavor was definitely a little understated - that could be both a good and bad thing. Nice and smooth, goes down easy and mild mouthfeel. Just the right amount of carbonation. Very well done - will have to try this brewery’s other IPAs.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Dogfish Head has made an incredible Imperial IPA. Wonderful balance of malt and hops and a great citrus backbone to it. I had to slow myself down while drinking this one. The feel is seemingly tailored to my exact preference and the taste is complex enough to make it stand out from the rest of the IPAs that I have tried. Do yourself a favor a try this beer! You will, most likely, not be disappointed. Ha, ha. Cheers!     Consumed on: 07/11/2018  Bottled on: 03/07/2018   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 A - Amber. Very easy to see through. Very little head with not a lot of lacing.    S - A tiny bit of hops with a decent amount of malt and booze. A little nutty.    T - Does not taste like an IPA. Very malty and nutty and boozy. A tiny bit of hops.    F - Very smooth. Goes down quite easy.    O - Very drinkable. Doesn't taste much like an IPA since there is not a lot of hops in the smell or taste. For 9%, it is not that boozy. You can still taste it, but it's not overpowering. Very malty for an IPA.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 I believe this is the best ipa in America. Pleasantly in between the 60 minute and 90 minute, it adds mor3 bitterness than the 60 minute with the experience of the 120 without the hangover regrets (usually). It has the best aroma Imo. The owner of DFH designed his ipas in a very grass roots way. He used a converted vibrating football game popular from the 1950s, and used it’s vibrating action to add hops over time to his beer. While this may sound strange, it’s this approach to experimentation that was the basis for Sams small batch microbrewery. My feeling is that this experimental approach is so engrained in its culture, that it will continue to turn out awesome beers for a very long time that break new ground. While they have amaging ipas of many types, my favorite is the 90 minute. It’s a bit more expensive than 60 minute, and hard to find, but if you see it, buy it. Enjoy!

One of the prettiest IPA's I've seen. Amber and shimmering with just a touch of haze and a fantastic head that lasts and lasts.    Despite being an IPA, this brew has a strong malt presence on the nose, although the hops deliver in mostly a floral way. The aroma overall is somewhat muted and a little disappointing given the billing and notoriety--still, on its own merits a fine aroma.    The flavor comes to the rescue though. Again, a strong malt backbone that presents with tropical-fruit sweetness and nuttiness, followed by a wallop of both floral and citrus/piney hoppiness. Not devastating but definitely tongue-tingling with just a touch of background booze. Excellent.    The mouthfeel is very complex. The strong malt base brings a viscous, almost chewy character, but the booze and carbonation thin it to a crisp, though definitely not dry, finish. Substantial but not heavy, and not sticky.    Overall, a yummy 200th brew.

look: 4 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 1.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 2.5 So for my 99th review, I have one of the most highly regarded brews in the world here. For number 100, I've got an even more special something: my first true whale beer, Pliny The Elder. Super excited to drink that. This one, on the other hand, I'm just trying to get out of the way.    I wanted to like this beer a lot. I've picked this up a few times. The first time I figured I must have gotten a bad batch. By the third time, I had had enough. It's been over a year since I've bothered with this brewery. But I figured I'd review this trash and say my piece:     This is the most overrated beer in the world.    L: The idea of it is very satisfying mathematically (90 minute boil, 90 ibu, 9% ABV, yada yada yada) and when poured into a glass, the perfectly clear viscous amber body and the persistence of that creamy beige head indicate that this could very well be an excellent beer.    S: Unfortunately the illusion breaks there. Almost no hop presence in this crap. 90 IBUs is probably a measurement from a pre-2010 batch that they still get to claim despite converting production toward a shit product with cheap ingredients. Sitting under my nose, it drags up whiffs of oxidized wheat crust, overcooked carrot, peach, some apricot, green apple peel, agave nectar, milk chocolate and honey. A touch of sage on the finish indicates that it does indeed contain some hops.    T: Tastes like a cheap imperial red ale. Tons of stale bread crust, canned peaches, canned mandarin, caramel, milk chocolate, and stale barley malt. Blechh. Can barely get through a bottle without chugging most of it.    F: What can be said about this beer is that it does not bother you with it's repulsive flavor for very long. On top of that, it has a very smooth and creamy texture.    O: From reading a few reviews on this site, I've noticed that those dating pre-2006 are, without a doubt, describing a completely different beer than those dating post-2010. That would be a great explanation for why this beer that deserves a rating closer to that of Shock Top has the world-class numbers it's working with. If you want to try a beer that tastes like this, I recommend you try Trader Joe's Drive-Thru Red Ale. About half the price and just as shitty.

Through the bottle neck, I can smell malty sweetness with some hops, not so much citrus but more earthy/piney (likely a bit too old for any citrus to remain). Sipping gives a touch of carbonation and the taste matches the smell, similar hop flavors, mainly malt. It starts piney, goes into malt fairly quickly and for a while, then after the malt fades a bit of bitterness and dryness rises to finish it off.     Deceptively smooth, I wouldn't get more than a glass of this around family or bosses.

As someone who inherently doesn't like IPAs, I'm going to treat it as any other beer.    Look: Amber orange with a good white head. Attractive.    Smell: Strong piney hop scent. A little malt and citrus in the back, but almost all hops.    Taste: Actually not as hoppy as the scent would suggest. A somewhat muted bitterness, with predominate citrus and non-bitter hop flavor. Despite its reputation as a strong IPA with a lot of hoppy notes, it's incredibly balanced.    Feel: A little thin and highly carbonated.    Overall: While I still don't like IPAs very much, this one is the best I've ever had. I'll keep drinking stouts and saisons, but this is a fine beer.

Smell is pretty average mostly citrus and pine grapefruit notes.   Taste is resin up front onto usual notes of pine and juicy citrus with a mellow subtle sweet biscuit finish.   Taste is perfect carbonation in my option and also slick on the tounge leave my mouth very juicy after a sip.   Overall an amazing IPA without a doubt I feel like it's a true IPA as well well hopped with perfect malty balance but that being said I am more of a fan of the west coast IPA's was just expecting a little more hops bitterness.

Aroma is caramel malty up front, earthy & piney hops, some citrus fruit at the end. Definitely a changeup from the fruity/piney/danky aroma profile of West Coast IPAs & DIPAs I'm used to.    Taste is earthy, malty & piney like the aroma. The fruit honestly taste more like dark fruit here than citrus. It is a nice mix, but very different from most IPAs and DIPAs out.    Mouthfeel is where this brew shines, very balanced all around, booze well contained, solid bitterness, clean & dry finish.    Overall, a very well-crafted DIPA that's really not about the fruitiness, which is just different from pretty much the rest of the market. If you're a WC dank, pine, fruity IPA lover or a soft, pillowy NEIPA lover - Hold Up! This is way different. Unique and stands apart, just not what I'm going for.

Smells of fresh cut grass, pear, with alcohol evident.     Strong malt breadiness gives way to sweet caramel, some light fruit and pepper spice and alcohol burn. Long hoppy finish. Real clean and crisp and a template for a robust DIPA.     Appreciate a straightforward IPA to sip that isn't a big juice bomb. Hearty, crisp, and well crafted.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip    L: Nearly clear golden copper pour with a solid 1.5 figners of foamy white head. Nice lacing.    S: Resinous pine, caramel malts. Aromatic with some floral notes.    T/F: Big malt backbone... sweet caramel and toasted grains. Bitterness follows... evergreen/pine, light fruit, and floral tones. Complex... slightly earthy. Balanced... light citrus comes through at the finish. Medium to light bodied.    O: A fantastic DIPA that I've had many, many times. Even as I've gotten more into the New England juice bombs this one never fails to please. A beer that was ahead of its time and still great today.

look: 3.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 16oz draft, nicely chilled  Look - solidly Amber but almost clear, not what I look for in an IPA; Smell - moderately hoppy, not much citrus or pine, something I like in an IPA; Taste - sufficient bitterness up front but fades quickly; Feel - crisp and smooth, good drink start to finish, good carbonation. Overall - Lacks in the points I look for, but i’ve Had worse.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 For me it all started on a snowy day in 2015, I was in a small college town of Monmouth Oregon. Beer was just recently introduced to me by a family friend. Not only did he tell me it would change my life, but it would affect how I did things from here on out. It did change my life, and it started with the 90 minute IPA by Dogfish Head. I was working at a winery at the time, but it was so snowy outside (oregon terms) because of this work was cancelled. I was still able to drive around with four-wheel drive, so I listen to my peers and seeked out a location where I could get my hands on this elusive beer. I purchased a four pack and brought it back to Monmouth. The ensuing hours later provided plenty of entertainment and joy. At this moment when I first put my lips to a 90-minute bottle, I knew what love was. From that moment forward I will never forget the night I fell in love with the pure lifestyle of Craft Brew in general.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Nice to have something to look forward to, coming home after a long night. Now, I don't typically go for a hoppy beer, particularly one that is hopped like a rabbit on meth. My go to beers are the ones you can't see through, but this came highly recommended by someone whose beer knowledge and opinions I trust implicitly.     Interestingly, rather than having a sharp, aggressive hoppiness, the DFH 90-Minute IPA is very balanced. Strong beery smell and taste, but the flavor had an amazing citrus zestiness that stays on your tongue. Nice head, deep gold color, good amount of carbonation, and at 9% ABV, I feel a bit woozy. And relaxed.

Getting into the IPA/APA's makes a Bud Light Lime that I had recently taste absolutely horrible! LOL ....I had a Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA the other day (The first time I've tried any Dogfish Head product) It was excellent! ...After 6 hours at a steady 34 degrees, I just had a 90-min. It went down quickly, feeling it big time! and ready for the next one! My overall rating is definitely higher than 4.01 :)   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Fantastic, perhaps not for the first time IPA drinker. Take everything about the 60 minute version and multiply it by 1.5 (get it?). Taste, smell and feel in much fuller and front forward with each sip. If enjoying a 60 minute is like getting your bachelor's degree enjoying this one is like getting your masters (I'm sure you know which dogfish gets you your PHD!!).

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Dark, hazy amber ale pours with two fingers of thick, smooth foam that leaves long, sticky legs behind as you drink it down. Juicy, grapefruity hops aromas fill the nose. Rich west-coast hops combined with a sturdy malt backbone, juicy citrus and caramel, all in a velvety smooth, medium-full bodied liquid that hides its higher alcohol content very well. Wonderful! Probably the best IIPA I've ever tasted, and certainly my favorite.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Just a classic beer. Clear golden/bronze, nice finger and a half white head that sits down as a nice sized ring, good lacing. Smell is hops, hops and hops. Piney, citrusy and a hint of sweet malts in botch scent and taste. Feels nice and creamy, slight touch of booze and a lingering biterness. nothing new to say here but always a go-to beer that I should enjoy more often.

Slightly bitter with light caramel blending into a fruity ending. Piney astringency enters the flavor more as it warms and it has a warming alcohol edge to the finish. I’m unsure how much I like this. I’m glad I tried it though. Pretty easy to drink for a 9% beer. I’m sure when this came out it was a great Imperial just too malt leaning and astringent for me for this style these days.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Last bottle of a 4-pack split between my sister and I (a Christmas present from my mom to both of us.) Bottling date is 10/(smudged)/17, so maybe 3 months old at most -- this one has been kept in refrigeration (bought at a grocery store, kept in fridge after) so I know it should be pretty fresh.    This is a really nice looking beer -- foam is a thin layer upon first pouring but then expands and slooowly starts to shrink back away in a fluffy cloud-like uneven way, the color is a nice dark orange, mostly clear (a bit of a haze is visible with the aid of a flashlight, but it's not like witbier/hefeweizen... or orange juice) with loads of tiny bubbles rising up in two curved streams.    Smell is somewhat mild at first, but pleasant. Fruity and piney/almost cedar-like hoppy smells are the most noticeable thing here. There's also a richer caramel-type malt in the background, compared to other IPAs I've had. After a few sips, when the foam has shrunk away just a bit, those piney hops come out in full force, becoming by far the most noticeable smell of the beer. Interestingly, toward the very end of the glass this flips around again and an almost toasted-sourdough-bread sort of thing starts to come through the wall of hop aromas. Always interesting to see a beer with flavors or smells that shift as you drink it, especially when it continues to be pleasant the whole way through.    Taste is different than a lot of other IPAs -- rather than being all hops with little to no malt, the malt seems to almost be the primary flavor, but with piney, slightly fruity, and bitter hops layered over it. The malt is rich just like in the smell, has a bit of a caramel-esque quality to it but not quite -- slightly sweet but balanced out by the bitterness of all the hops so the beer overall never really "feels" sweet. Getting a slightly unpleasant thing here and there that I'm not sure how to describe (maybe a wet fabric/hair sort of deal?), but it's only there for a moment and not on every sip. My glass may be to blame for that one as I don't recall tasting this "off" flavor in the bottle I had before the current four-pack (a much older bottle, almost gave a "lite barleywine" impression more than IPA, but still pretty good), which I drank from a different glass when visiting family a while back. Since I only noticed that thing once or twice each time, and only in this glass, I'm blaming the glass and not letting it affect my score of the beer itself. Burps are nice piney hop flavor all the way. At first I wasn't super impressed but this is really growing on me the more I drink.    Feel is light and crisp at first, then more substantial-feeling. A little odd to transition from one extreme to the other like that, but it works! There's a hop-oily lingering feeling in the mouth for a while after a sip or two, and the bitterness, while never seeming at all harsh or overwhelming, somehow seems to go all the way down the back of your throat as you swallow a sip of the beer rather than only being felt/tasted on the tongue. Seems heavier than a lot of IPAs, which I suppose makes sense considering that it's 9% ABV and this was (if I recall my beer history correctly) one of the "OG" double IPAs back before "double IPA" was even really a defined thing.    So here's a confession -- I glanced at the average score and went into this review (based on my impressions of the previous bottle) thinking that there was no way I'd give this beer a 4.2ish average, maybe a high 3-somethings or an even 4 at best. And then as I actually drank the beer and put my thoughts down and converted them into numbers... I found myself enjoying it more and more from one sip to the next. This is a beer that grows on you, for sure -- if you tried it just once and weren't a fan (or even thought it was "good but not great"), I would recommend you give it another chance. This was definitely a lesson in why my policy of always trying a beer twice before putting your thoughts down in a review is a good idea -- some beers just get better the second, or third, or fourth time you drink them. If you're a fan of hop/malt balance with both ingredients being obvious contributors but neither quite overpowering the other, try a fresh bottle (or four) of this beer.

The color is copper and the small head is light tan.    The aroma is rich and overall sweet, with melon, orange, light resin, and cotton candy covering down on the hops.     Very sweet and malty. Distinct flavors of caramel, pudding, orange marmalade, and cotton candy.     This beer is medium bodied, slick, and has enough carbonation to stand up to the sweetness and viscosity.     At just over a month old, this isn't the hop bomb of reputation. Based on this OG east coast IPA, I can see where the reputation they have for being malty comes from. It carries the alcohol well, has some good hop flavor, and the sweetness and bitterness are subtly balanced.

The beer pours bright light honey amber in color with light tan head. Retention and lacing are above average. The aroma is faint caramel and faint citrus/pine. The taste is semisweet caramel with a citrus undertone that transitions to piney moderate bitterness with a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. There is some residual hop oil and unfermented sugar that keep the feel sticky, but not cloying. Overall, very good. A classic east coast IPA. Still enjoyable, but not nearly best in class.

The aroma has a pleasant maltiness that compliments it’s east coast hazy look. For my pallet this beer is wayyyyyyy too bitter and any citrus notes are crushed by that bitterness. The aftertaste is quite pleasant though. Interesting beer. Good beer but I would not get this again.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Bottled 9/12/17. DFH Tulip. Perfect glassware!    A: pours a hazy dark copper with 1 finger of thick off-white head and a few lazy bubbles here and there. Thick cap retains well. Moderate lacing.    S: super resiny, sweet, candied citrus and a touch of pineapple. Navel oranges. A little boozy and syrupy on the nose. Behind the feel, the smell of this beer is perfect DIPA.    T: bitter, boozy arrival. Alcohol and hops. Malt across the middle stops just short of sweet. Lingering sweet but slightly unripe orange citrusy bitterness.    M: heavier end of midweight, moderately high carbonation. Surprisingly clean. Actually the mouthfeel may be the strongest part of this beer.    O: reminds me of sixpoint resin. Full hoppy citrusy sweet aroma and a malty but not sweet and powerful palate. Alcohol is slightly present, and the hop assault is in full effect, but this one is a real winner.

But it left an impression. A good one. I enjoyed it so. For the money you pay, you are defintely getting a quality beer. No two ways about that. Has good flavor, color, and "horsepower" for what it is as I call it.

look: 3.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 Poured into a standard pint glass. Slight tinge of orange colour to this beer that I was not expecting (although there is no reason why it shouldn't have some orange in it). Nice citrus particularly orange comes through on the nose. Malt (caramel) sweetness also evident. Massive malt sweetness and orange comes up front on tasting. As the label suggests, the malt puts the hops in its place so to speak, making the hops seems rather subdued. Overall I find the malt bill to be cloying and overpowering. I can taste more alcohol than hops. An IPA? Where's the beef?   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Lord, thought I'd rated this year's ago. Fresh bottle in a DogFish Head IPA glass. Decent head, mild lacing, not as pillowy as a Bells Two Hearted. Golden yellow in color, regular IPA aroma. But the taste is so smooth. This is one of the best IPAs on earth. Good thing it comes in 4 packs cause it packs a kick. Nice job, DogFish Head!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 From notes taken 05/05/17 (if I recall correctly, I have had this for over two years, and it's still quite good, will consider reviewing a more fresh one and using that rating):    Especially cloudy, multi-toned, enticing orange-amber. Foamy and almost creamy head of very light yellow, with excellent retention and sticky, chunky lacing. Opened bottle, first aroma was dough. After the pour, that gives way to a nose of dankness, aged fruit, toast, tropical fruit, white wine even, and resin or pine. Leathery and dank throughout to the taste, mostly short of perfumes or soaps which is definitely a positive, with orange and grapefruit and peach and mango as it warms and sloshes around, a medicinal booze finish, a bitter but toffee-like aftertaste, and rindy retro-olfaction. Medium-bodied, silky smooth at first with slowly-rising fine and tingly carbonation bringing the texture closer to cream. Less alcoholic heat than ABV would generally indicate.

Prost!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3.75 Poured into a Belgian beer glass a deep golden,orange,amber. 1 1/2 " creamy head, sticky white lacing on the glass. Tastes like a well balanced "east coast", or English imperial IPA. High quality caramel malt backbone. Somewhat floral. Mild hoppiness compared to West coast hop bombs. ( Which I also enjoy very much) Mild fresh baked bread, flowers. Feels smooth and quaffable for a 9% ABV. Not too slick, Not too dry. Delicious example. Again Kudos to DFH !! A little more hop bite to offset the malts and I think you would be solid 5.That is my opinion. But then again if it isn't broken don't fix it.Great brew! REVISED 11/22/17: After many months of drinking 90 minute I must say there is too much malt for my taste in a IPA either west or east coast style.

It was my introduction to IPAs when I got into beers in '06, back when it wasn't in grocery stores and I had to scrounge out of the way to a specialty store.     I've had countless IPAs since, and it still tastes like the ultimate ambrosia of the gods to me even after all these years. There's no other IPA like it. 90 forever!

Smells piney, floral, very faint tobacco, and has many delightfully sweet citrus notes: cherry, tangerine, orange, pineapple, and mango.    A mix of cherry and orange peel smoothly flood the mouth delicately with very notable creamy carbonation, with a following grapefruit peel and hoppy aftertaste that balances the malty goodness.    Incredible.

Had this one in bottle and not on tab (SAD!).    L: MUCH better looking beer as compared to the 60 minute, pours darker and danker.  S: Hoppy and piney, with potentially a hint of tobacco smell mixed into this orangy concoction  T: so drinkable, honestly tastes great. Dangerous because of it's lack of kick. I for one prefer a dirty, hoppy IPA or a juicy NEIPA but this is a great tasting beer.  F: Too light tasting for 9%, this would almost be jungle juice of doubles.  O: 4.069, would recommend but not a world beater by any means.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This beer pours a slightly cloudy amber with a large head. The aroma is dense and dank, with pine, resin, cannabis, mango, tobacco, and grass. The flavor starts with rich sweet malt, leading or orange peel, sweet pine, cannabis, caramel, and a woodsy spice flavor. The mouthfeel is fairly full with bright but creamy carbonation. Overall this is a pretty tasty beer - not exciting, but tasty and dangerously drinkable.

Rich smooth taste, not bitter.    Dogfish Head taste test: 60 Minute IPA vs 90 Minute IPA  The 90 Minute is slightly darker and has a creamier foamier head. The 60 minute is milder, the 90 minute sharper. 60 minute = 6% alc. 90 minute = 9% alc. By the time you finish them both, the taste test really doesn't matter so much.    90 Minute IPA is my favorite IPA, so far.

This gives a 2 finger aromatic head that lasts.  The color is a cloudy dark straw.  There is slight aroma from malt and hops.  There is a really nice balance of taste from malt and hops which is more citrusy than Sierra Nevada.  Bitterness is fully balanced throughout the palate with a hint of malt which offers a smooth finish. Very little bitter aftertaste. perfectly balanced flavor! Definitely not as bitter as Sierra Nevada 40 IBU or Torpedo 65 IBU. I really could not tell much difference between the 60 minute and the 90 minute IPA, except for the alcohol aftereffects, which were greater with the 90 minute. Wow, more like a wine!!!

I was headlong into west-coast IPAs and the maltiness of this beer turned me off.  I was foolish.   This is a much finer beer than I remember because, for one thing, I've learned to appreciate more malty notes; but mostly it's because Dogfish Head is a great brewery.   I would say the flavor is more like a (very) hoppy barleywine. Which, with my current palate, suits me just fine.  Piney hops provide a lingering dryness, but the real attraction here is the caramel dark fruit that hits, yet doesn't overstay its welcome like a lot of Belgium quads.   Highly, highly recommended.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 The appearance was a nice hazy golden yellow to orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dies within about a minute and leaves some good somewhat sticky lacing. The aroma has always been powerful through sweet caramel malts combined with a super nice sweet bittersweet citrus to light piney hoppiness. The taste has always been a super nice long bittersweet citrusy caramel flavoring. On the palate, this one sits about a medium on the body with a nice structured sessionability. I want to sip it but often find myself constantly picking up the glass. Overall, really good DIPA always easy to find and always giving me good vibes to sip on whenever I can find it.

Solid lacing.   S: Light hoppy floral aroma.   T: Excellent hoppy flavor; juicy, creamy, strong, floral and ripe fruit, a little earth and pine bitterness combined with a great, rich malt balance. Website says brandied fruitcake, raiseny, citrusy. I agree.   F: Spicy abv bite. Very drinkable.   O: Reminds me of a mixture between Loose Cannon Hopx3 and Harpoon IPA.

Great balance of malt with the declared intensity of hop additions. This brew is in no way bitter and still, impressively, not overly sweet. Right out of the fridge into a belgian tulip glass, the brew tastes a bit coppery and lacks its potential depth. Let it heat up closer to 60*F for that real experience of caramel, malty, and hoppy goodness.

Feel: A faint bit of alcohol is accompanied by a strong malt finish and light carbonation.  Overall: To me, this is how a DIPA tastes. Cheers!

The taste is very bitter but this is how I love my beers. Mouthfeel is thick and oily.     = I dig this DIPA. Great taste with loads of hops. You can never go wrong.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Pours a frosted amber-orange with two fingers of dense, off-white foam. Head retention is fantastic, with great lacing left behind. Aroma is earthy and biscuity malts with floral hops. Not overly loud, but it is a dense, earthy aroma. Flavor profile puts floral, herbal hops on the tongue immediately, with a herbal hop finish. Earthy, biscuit malts swell up in the middle before stepping out of the way of the hop finish. Mouth feel is thick, with a huge, velvety texture. It's quite filling. Overall, this beer is 9% and definitely carries the presence of a 9% beer. While not extremely high, it is in dangerous territory. The thick feel, and dense flavor profile really level this one off as a pleasant sipper. Very enjoyable beer without an over-done bitterness.    Served in a 12oz snifter from bottle.

Smell is subdued but hoppy and slightly fruity. Tastes quite bitter with hints of grapefruit, and a bit of booziness comes through. However, the malt balanced it out pretty well and it's a good sipping beer. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy, lightly carbonated and finishes dry. Overall a very nice IPA, I'm glad I can finally get this in Minnesota. Bottle was almost two months old, so ill be looking for a fresh one wherever I can.

Bitter and sweet from the hops, yet it is also smooth. Notes of citrus, especially grapefruit. Very malty. Strong taste. I also get a warmth through my body when drinking this brew.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 I purchased a single Dog Fish Head 90 minute at local for a tasting.   Poured a super chilled bottle into a glass that presented a IIPA smokey orange red glow.   DFH 90 pours fine foam head and leaves a great lacing to my glass after each sip.  No over powering hop aroma that would register on anyone’s 'skunky beer meter. ' Its smooth malt hop flavor has no palate harsh biting after shock even for a 90 IBU. Somewhat sweet flavor that could disguise the alcohol kick that comes with this fine imperil. I would recommend this to anyone’s rotation pool.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 I probably shouldn't have had this one on the same night as Stone's Enjoy by, but at least I can tell the difference between these two imperial IPAs.   The look is a lovely Amber-orange, a very nice foamy head, not quite off white and rich looking  The smell is a bit subdued, but you still get all the notes of grapefruit, some other tropical fruits, and a slight sweetness from the malt.  The taste is almost exactly like the nose, the hops are also subdued initially, but as the beer warms up you can get more of the hop-bitterness on the back end, backed up by that lovely malt backbone.  The mouthfeel is what I call a rich lightness bordering on medium. Very smooth all the way through, a highly drinkable DIPA.  Overall, what I get from this beer is that its a subdued version of Stone's Enjoy By, which ain't such a bad thing. Since this is more readily available in my area, it probably would be my go to DIPA (Until I try more of Lagunitas' stuff, that is). It's definitely an enjoyable, outstanding beer.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Dark coppery color from the rich malt in the beer, this is a serious double IPA. Strong hops and malt profile provide a bitter profile to match some of the sweeter sugars in the beer. It's a man's beer and is a great choice to have.

Everything you want in a DIPA if you appreciate balance rather than extreme bitterness.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Look is very nice and coppery. Somewhat oily looking.    The smell is fairly decent, but not among the better qualities of this extremely good beer. It's somewhat like hay.    The taste is exceptional. I'm not generally a fan of IPAs, but this is top notch. There is a good deal of complexity; which is to say a nice mix of pine, malty sweetness, and perhaps a hint of "pale ale" instead of IPA in there. The aftertaste has a nice "bite" to it, but the flavor to me wasn't quite as good as the earlier part of a drink.    Overall, a solid 4.75 . Great beer, but I'm not going to inflate the score to perfect just based on reputation. The minor factors bringing it down just a shade for me were the aftertaste and that if you keep it in your mouth a little too long, it's not quite as pleasant.

Starts sweet with malts then the hops take the next beat with a bitter kick that's well balanced.   Flavor is complex and worth savoring, the feel evolves as you sip and plays like a symphony.  Overall, worth your time if you appreciate a fine craft IPA.

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 One of my favorite beers. Pretty, light copper color with decent head and a light lacing. Smells hoppy and the taste is balanced nicely for people who like a strong IPA without that hoppy kick in the face. Feels just a little light. Overall, it's phenomenal. I think they got a little crazy with the malts... it has a weird kinda sweetness to it. Just a bit too much sweetness for me, but I love my hops more than I love my wife. Anyone who likes insane hops should check out the 120 minute. For an 18% (on average) ABV, it's very drinkable for everyone, not just the Hopheads.

The head of this brew is about two fingers thick. There is also a decent amount lacing to this IPA, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell of 90 Minute IPA, is rich with sweetness, earthly grains and malts. There is a mildness of hops in the smell of this brew. The look and smell are really inviting. Now for the taste, it is bold with flavors. You first pick up on the hop bitterness then the earthy grains and malts. There is also a nice amount of sweetness in the taste of this brew. It is really hard to pick up on the 9.00% AVB in this brew. It goes down that smooth. This is a nice medium to heavy bodied brew. You can feel that this IPA is heavier than most on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. The mouth feel is Bold Hoppy, Sweet, Clean and Refreshing. Overall I'm giving 90 Minute IPA a 4.50 out of 5. I would definitely buy this brew again. Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, did a super nice job with this American Double/ Imperial IPA. If you are looking for a boder IPA look this one up.

Poured from the bottle into a snifter, this beer's head is two fingers thick and off-white, with solid lacing, and a clear deep oakish brown body.    Smells like honey biscuit/cracker malts with oily,resinous hops of the pine/grapefruit variety.    I taste big malts defending the palate throne from massive hop notes.    Medium mouthfeel with mild carbonation.    I'll rate 90 Minute IPA | Dogfish Head Craft Brewery with a 4.5

Smell is tropical fruits, pine and sweet malts. Taste is tropical fruits, citrus, pine and sweet malts that balance out the hop presence. Medium bodied, lightly carbonated, smooth mouth feel.

A wonderful treat that is widely available here in NYC.

This comes right on the tail of my admittedly critical review of Dogfish Head's 60 Minute IPA, and the fact that 90 minute actually saw completion before its younger cousin just might showcase a case of striking oil upon first dig. The smell is a perfect mingling of pungent, almost fruity hops, with an absolutely insane merging of hop characteristics to follow in taste. Earthiness, dankness, bitterness, the whole shebang. It finishes with a really well-rounded, mouth-filling malt backbone that wraps up the whole experience, all isolated to a single sip.    Nerdom complete. This is a good beer. You should drink it.

Feel: light body, crisp, it’s very juicy. It is easy drinking despite the 90 IBU. Overall it is a great IPA.

Very rarely I am impressed at how a beer looks, but this was by far the most visually appealing beer I have had in a very, long time, if not ever. A beautiful ocher colored brew with heavenly white head, a staying power that was impressive and a lacing that was more of a sheen than lacing - very impressive. The smell was muted - not so strong with the hops, not so strong with the spices, but good nonetheless. The feel was light yet crisp and somewhat biting - something else that was unique and unlike I have experienced. The taste was way better than their 60-min offering, but compared to other IPAs it ranks up there for the ones I have had. Overall, a very good IPA, maybe not the best I've had, but certainly the best I have had in recent memory.

On the nose I get a nice combination of hops,and malts.Very hard to pinpoint anything specific,but I do get some floral notes on the nose as well.    On the palate I get alot of sweets malts,blended with some piney hops.This beer is more sweet than bitter to me...It is a few months old,so I may need to try a fresh one,to get a fair assessment.    The body is thin,with a medium dry finish.    This was a pretty solid IPA,but nothing special.I may need to find a fresh one,to give a better analysis.But overall a pretty good IPA.

It's more a barleywine than IPA and I'd prefer 120 over this for it possesses same taste but at least 120 is around 18% abv. Although the 90 is a bit more balanced than 120 and not as harsh. Nevertheless I would stay away from this fresh and as far as aged couldn't tell you but I am aging a couple in hopes of better flavor.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 First impression is a malty, creamy feel with a balanced bitterness on the back end. Excellent balance and a smooth hoppiness; definitely not overwhelming or in-your-face hops. DIPA/Imperial compare to others liked. Definitely buy again. 9% ABV.  Note: Original rating was 4.25  Second review 6/29/17 ) Pours golden Amber with medium head and lacing to finish.  Apparently my tastes have changed as Dogfish Head's self-described "pungent" smell/taste is now more a heavy influence: could not quite put my finger on it until a reader described it as a "very hoppy barleywine" and Dogfish Head noted "different grains" as influential. Bingo. Not a fan of barleywine or some grains with excessive influence. Smell, taste, aftertaste are all affected by this. Malts, hops, bitterness profile combine to overcome my bias. Personal preference leans toward several others: Green Flash West Coast IPA; Prairie Phantasmagoria; Founders Double Trouble; Stone Citracado; Stone RuinTen Triple IPA and Stone Ruination Double IPA 2.0; Sixpoint Resin, Hi-Resin & Puff; Coop Alpha Hive.  Still a good beer. 9.0% ABV, 90 IBUs

This Medium to heavy weight beer has a woody yet well grounded and earthy taste that will give you something to enjoy in the moment, yet bring you back with the memories of sipping this excellent beer for hours on end.

I got more pine than anything else.  T (4.5) - My sixer was old, but still incredibly tasty. This is arguably my favorite style and this is quintessential IIPA. Deep complex caramel malts perfectly balanced by plenty of hops. Hops would be more noticeable in a fresher batch.  F (4.5) - Fairly carbonated, but still easy to drink. Not very thick  O (4.5) - I had been wanting this for a long time and found one out of town that was old. Bought it anyway, and it was still very good.

That is my relationship with this beer. If Sierra Nevada Pale Ale introduced me in my teens to good beer, the 90 Minute introduced me to great beer in my 20s. The thing is, when I go back to that well, I remember every time why this beer is not just a classic, but one that withstands the taste of time.

The beer has a slight citrus and mango flavor but not overwhelming. The beer coats the mouth and is slightly sticky and drying.

Flavors of toffee and caramel, a bit off putting, but follows up with a decent dose of tropical fruits like papaya and mango and passion fruit. A hint of coffee finishes it off.   Feel is mostly wet and carbonated, leaving a slightly slick coating on the palate.   Overall, a far cry from 120 minute, but still a decent beer. Glad I was able to get a pint and not splurge on a 4 pack.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 crystal clear golden orange appearance, dense white head with some nice lacing and great retention - shes a looker!!    on the nose is caramel, toffee, pine, grassy floral notes, bready malts. not what you would expect from a typical IPA but thats what makes it unique, very pleasant aroma. taste follows well, good amount of malt sweetness provides balance for some piney bitterness, a hint of citrus. no date on the bottle but I have to imagine itd be a bit hoppier if it were fresh ... which would make it awesome! the way it is now, great beer but the malt is a bit much for the style.

The nose delivers on the tounge; not for the faint of heart. Not my favorite imperial IPA (I prefer a hop-leaning IBU train) but it is a classic.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Bought this at the Craft Beer Cellar in Portland, Maine, enjoyed at around 6C from the comfort of my kitchen.    L: Golden orange, quite clear, pretty small white head with moderate retention & just a touch of lacing down the glass.  S: Some hops but mild, to me it's balanced with bready & mango aromas  T: It's clearly well balanced with some citrus & bready flavours, but to me the peach/mango sweetness comes through most noticeably. There's just a hint of alcohol & pleasant bitterness at the end, well hidden by the other tastes which come through more predominantly.  F: Smooth & full  Overall: It's clearly a great beer. I tend to like IPAs & DIPAs with more citrus & less peach/mango but I really enjoyed this one & for its 9%abv it was ridiculously drinkable. I would have enjoyed a dozen but alas had just one.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 I've bought this old friend often throughout the years, and it has never disappointed me. It has 9% alcohol, and I'll drink a single bottle at night only when I need a heavy hit. Otherwise, I'll drink something with less alcohol. The Dogfish Head 60 doesn't match the 90, and the Dogfish Head 120 is over the top. As with most of my beers, I buy mine at Kahns in Indianapolis where they're kept in very cold cooler and have a rapid turnover. As I've said in other reviews, the Imperial IPA hops fall off rapidly, so these beers must be drunk at once. I suspect many bad IPA reviews come from beer that has lain in the refrigerator or on the shelf too long, or not kept cold, or gone bad at tap from an old, seldom used keg. Always buy your beer from the brewery itself, or from a cooler at a liquor store with rapid turnover. Take your chances at the tap, unless it's close to the brewery, and with high turnover, such as 3 Floyds' Zombie Dust (Munster, Indiana) on tap at Wrigley Field, (Chicago).

Not hoppy enough for some of my friends, but I appreciate the craftsmanship of a very balanced imperial IPA.  F- nice crisp feel.  O- I love this beer. And Like I said before a very well balanced IPA, the malt cuts the bitterness down which is a good and bad thing, but for this beer it works. You can tell a lot of love went into making this beer.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 In a tasting of 24 IPAs, the Dogfish Head 90 Minute was my hands down favorite, mainly because of its balance and malty character. That's not to say that it's not hops forward- it definitely is- but the malt cuts the bitterness with a bready sweetness that I really liked.     In the overall tasting, I realized I am definitely partial to less hoppy IPAs with lower alcohol contents. A friend I was tasting with had the opposite preference; lots of hops and high alcohol. Yet at the end of the day, we both chose Dogfish 90 Minute IPA as our favorite of the group (all of which are listed below), which I think speaks to the beer's versatility and overall appeal.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Beer was on draft and complemented the wings that were accompanying it. The flavor was very malty initially, but then the citrus undertones start to take over and coat your tongue very pleasantly. Not a fan of IPAs but i heard Dogfish Head has a great selection and was not let down. The head was small, almost non-existent and the color was a darker orange tone. The smell was pleasant and reflected the citrus notes. The hops were not overbearing in the traditional sense as you would think of an IPA.     Overall, it was a well crafted beer and i will enjoy it again, perhaps over a grilled cheese next time!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Bottle Date: 6/15/16  Palate Contaminants: meat and potatoes    Appearance is a clear, dark amber that's really more orange. Not much head.    The smell is like a hoppy marmalade. A little malt, a little bit of floral scent. If it was a bit stronger, the grade would be even higher.    Taste has more malt and less citrus, but the degree of sweetness is in the proverbial wheelhouse for my own taste buds. There is also some bitterness up front, but it fades quickly so to not wear out its welcome. There's a good amount of earthiness, as well. The hops are the headliner, but they're there to get along with everybody. The marmalade does get stronger as it warms up.     It's definitely similar to Burton Baton, but less impactful and with a slight bit warmer feel. Not too carbonated, not too flat, just right. Not too boozy, not too thin, just right. It's easy to knock back, so be careful since it's an niner.

look: 2.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 3.75 Poured from growler into tulip. Pleasent tropical fruit hop charecter with a toasty (perhaps too toasty) malt backbone. A little bit of grapey booziness on the very end. Good beer but perhaps a bit overrated. Would love this beer if the malt charecter was just slightly less roasty.

The hoppiness is there for sure and it's got a nice flavor to it.

It smells of sweet malt, orange peel, and resinous hops. The taste is a nice blend of malt and hops: it features bready malt, sweet fruit, brown sugar, and hops. There is a slight bitterness at the finish but overall the hops don't bite. You can also taste the booze. This ale has a nice thick body, is moderately carbonated, and the 9% ABV packs a punch. Overall, this is one of the best "malty" IPA's available. I don't drink it a lot but when I do I enjoy it!   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pour is clear amber. Aroma is hoppy, alcohol sweet, orange peel? Taste is along those lines, I think this beer excels in its balance. Bitter hoppiness, slight booze, malt and pine, none of this overpowering. Even throughout, citrus, and it's stronger than it feels. Astringent stickiness on the tongue in the aftertaste. Hops without the bad part of being too hoppy. You know, you dodged a bullet. Now I get it.     I've had better IIPAs, but for now let's call it the best gateway Imperial IPA ever.

The aroma has plenty of resinous hops character, with hints of tropical fruit such as mangos and peaches. No malt backbone detected in the aroma. With the taste, talk about a 360 degree turn with the "no malt" detection. Pretty much all I'm getting with the taste. Hints of resinous hops, but the sweet biscuit like malt is the showcase. Mouthfeel is relatively thin, but the malt profile still is mouth coating. Overall, not a bad beer that's apparently accessible in many parts of the world.

Smells primarily of bread from the malts with a hint of pine to it. Flavor follows being primarily malt heavy with a little pine from the hops following. Flavor lingered a little, again mostly the malt. Didn't notice much bitterness from the hops or really much hop flavor as is. Feel is light with no carbonation. Overall it's a decent beer but not one I think I'll pick up again, too heavy on the malt for this style.

There are many beers that I enjoy - this one puts most of those to shame. the only issue I can take w/ this beer is that it's a bit heavy so I'm full after 2 or 3 and I like to keep going!

look: 4 | smell: 2 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 I get to be one of those negative reviewers. This beer gets a ton of hype but it really does not live up to it when compared to other IIPAs/DIPAs. First off, it is not balanced. The malts overpower the hops in the smell, foretaste, and midtaste. Only in the aftertaste do I get anything that resembles the sweet stickey pineyness of hops. What does that mean in the grand scheme of things? The color is spectacular but it is just an unbalanced average beer, favoring the malt side of the scale which I do not prefer. After about 30 minutes sipping, smell resembles alcohol. It know it's a 9+ percenter but other DIPAs certainly mask it much better in the aromatics and taste.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Bronzy gold color with an abundant off-white head that leaves decent lacing on the glass. Nose of woodsy, resinous hops, but not too strong, with a definite malty presence as well. Taste: a double IPA that is malt-dominant? Hops emerge from the malt as the taste evolves, but this was not a "hops forward" IPA, even though the hops are obvious and tasty. The flavor is more of a back-and-forth duet between malt and hops, both making delightful contributions. Mouthfeel a little slick, moderatly sudsy as good IPAs often are. A great beer.    Bottled 3/30/2016, per the bottle stamp.
