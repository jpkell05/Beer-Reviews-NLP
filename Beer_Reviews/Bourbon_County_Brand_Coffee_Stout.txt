look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 I received this 2017 Bourbon County Stout through a BIF. It has been patiently waiting for me to consume this delicious nector within. The beer is 50 degree and served in tulip glass. The pour of the beer produced a one finger medium dark tan head. The head dissipated rather quickly and left no lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 35 a dark brown nearly black. The clarity of the beer is opaque. The only visible sign of the head is a tan ring around the beer.     The coffee aromas from the beer are similar to a fresh pot of coffee brewed. Next, I get dark chocolate, roasted malts, molasses, anise, bready, earthy, vanilla, and a subtle char note.     The flavors of this coffee stout are more impressive than the nose. The coffee is robust and intense and not bitter. The characteristics I get are expresso, anise, bready, dark chocolate, molasses, roasted malts, earthy, vanilla, a touch of char, and a subtle smokiness.    The mouthfeel of the beer is dry and chewy.     The body of the beer is full, low carbonation, and full finish.     I love these flavors in this coffee beer. The harmony is unparallel to other coffee beers I have had in the past. I am so glad I got to drink this beer.

Poured with a tan/mocha head that dissapated into minimal lacing   S - traditional bcbs smell. Coffee is still there but not as much when fresh. Get some ethonal. Great barrel and bourbon sent. Vanilla.   T - bourbon, barrel, coffee, vanilla, marshmello. Some heat   F - think pillowing feel. As it has warmed has thinned out some.   O - great beer that captures all the fundamentals of bcbs and a great adjunct. Recommend drinking this fresher. I think I prefer regular to this

Side by Side Comparison of 2017 Bourbon County Stout(1), Coffee Stout(2), Northwoods(3), Barleywine(4).    LOOK: dark black, brown head fades, similar to BCBS.  AROMA: coffee drowns out other aromas found in BCBS, but the coffee is unique. Super Smokey.   TASTE: coffee , vanilla, bourbon all work well together. As I drink BCBS and BCBCS together, the coffee seems to "linger" better. BCBS is seeming overly sweet in comparison.  FEEL: thinner than BCBS, but a touch of carbonation cones through.    **

Big coffee aroma, chocolate and barrel presence are there as well. Huge coffee flavor, base BCBS beer is faintly intact, lots of dark chocolate and bourbon barrel on the finish, pretty sweet but not cloying. Carbonation is perfect, the beer is pretty chewy and syrupy. Overall an excellent variant, adjunct is still intact a year later. Pretty amazing brew, especially considering it is available nationallly.    11/25/18  16.9 oz bottle, 2017 vintage  4.5 rating

Smell- classic BCBS aroma, I get sweetness and big barrel. Coffee not as prominent on the nose as I expected.   Taste- has all of the qualities of the base (roasty, warm booze, malt sweetness & bourbon) but the coffee adds a spicyness that is unique. Not green peppers but adding richness and bite to the body without overpowering. Good stuff.  Feel- warmth from the barrel, medium body not too thick or sticky.  Overall- big fan of the BCBS series, this stands out for sure. Nice that the coffee is more of a compliment to the base beer rather than overpowering.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Bottled on 7/25/17    Pours a thick, viscous black with a pillowy, sandy caramel head; it dissipates quickly and leaves little, if any, lacing.    First inhale gives off deep notes of baker's chocolate, fudge, and soft bits of oak and vanilla; some more nosing reveals subdued aromas of sweet malt, caramel, and ground dark-roast coffee.    The taste yields plenty of the now-familiar baker's chocolate, smooth oak, dark chocolate fudge, and vanilla, all in conjunction with a backbone of roasty malt; although obviously faded from the near-year in the bottle, soft coffee undertones have had an impact on the overall flavor profile, imparting an earthy bitterness and roasty ground coffee dusting to all the adjuncts.    The mouthfeel is big, almost chewy, but it never detracts from the flavor experience; its slick, oily qualities add a softness to balance out any carbonation to deliver an almost effortless feel.    While its time in the bottle clearly toned down the coffee notes, this was still an incredibly nuanced stout that showed quite a spectrum of flavor. That being said, I'd love to try this one fresh; I can see this being absolutely brilliant with the coffee more intact.

Predominantly sweet.  Smooth, sticky. Warm    2016  Very similar nose to 17.  Slightly thicker pour.  Sweet, roasty. Good balance. Very subtle barrel.    2017  Super roasty pour. Subtle cinnamon. Roasty, oak, subtle spice, subtle burn. Great balance. Very good. Fairly thin, medium carb.

Taste is chocolate and espresso, a little vanilla, and some roastiness. Mouthfeel is medium, not as thick as I would like. Overall, this is fantastic and definitely worth the high score it has.

Swallow is more coffee, roasted malts and dark chocolate with some lingering molasses like dark sugar notes   M: This beer is big and slightly chewy on the palate while also being slightly silky. Carbonation is low but adequate for the style and ABV while the beer has a drying finish.  O: Overall this is a really great beer. The flavors are really good and the complexity is very nice as well. Fairly coffee forward but the other notes are still able to shine through. Definitely worth trying if you can get it.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Each year I look forward to the complex deliciousness of Bourbon County Coffee Stout. It never disappoints. 2017 is chocolatey though light on the coffee with a very well hidden ABV. As others have said, a bit subdued. Prefer the 2016 (a 4.5), but still a fantastic stout.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 A: Beer pours an almost completly black body only the smallest amount of brown appears in the body. Minimal head at first pour but a good amount of carbonation and head retention while drinking.     S: Beer has a large amount of chocolate sweetness. Not getting much of the coffee aromas but still good overall. The barrel aromas seemed to have mellowed out since I first had this last December.     T: Lots of sweetness. The barrel aging is faint but pleasant. Only getting the smallest amount of coffee bitterness. Comparing this to how it was in December the bourbon has mellowed quite a bit and the coffee has faded a lot. Very nice just missing the coffee flavors.     M: Very thick mouthfeel. Taste is almost like a liquid brownie. The ABV is very well hidden. I notice only the smallest amount of bourbon kick. Very smooth and sneaky easy to drink.     O: Very easy drinking beer for a double digit ABV. Coffee has faded since I had this in December but the bourbon is not near as harsh. Very good beer just missing the coffee.

Lots of spice coming through and the coffee balances well the sweet notes offered by the bourbon both on the nose and the taste.

The mix is about 90% BCBS to 10% coffee, which really drags down the ABV but even still doesn't add as much of that Intelligentsia flare as you might think (my favorite coffee in the city, hands down!).

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Appearance - Pours black with thin tan cap that dissipates very quickly no lacing or head at all.    Aroma - Lots of roasted malts, oak and bourbon light amount of dark chocolate. I am not getting much coffee but what I am getting is like a cold pressed black coffee.    Taste - Taste is much more pronounced that the aroma big roasted malts, rich chocolate, bourbon and oak. Sweet vanilla with hints of caramel along with coffee beans.    Feel - Full creamy feel, slick warming from the bourbon soft smooth carbonation.    Overall - A really well done coffee stout the coffee could have been stronger in the aroma but the taste is amazing and makes up for that.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 2017 bottle.  Big fresh-brewed espresso aroma blending well with the aged roasted malts and bourbon.

Glad I could try it!   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2014 version, bottled on 11/7. Hiding in cellar for a few years.  A-Poured into a snifter, a very thin layer of tan head quickly recedes to nothingness over the typical black as black brew.  S-Cold the bourbon barrel aromas and some spicy, earthy coffee notes pop. Vanilla, oak, caramel, dark roasted malt. As it warms, the boozy notes become more prevalent. Some more notes of chocolate and sweet cooked malts come out too.   T-Whoa, this is drinking great. The coffee flavors are still layered in very nicely and holding up strong with the big stout and bourbon notes.   M-Big slick, heavy mouthfeel as usual with BCS. The coffee gives this a spicy kick beyond the bourbon imperial stout warming.   O-Holding up beautifully with 3+ years on it. Still a big BB stout with the coffee adding some nice additional flavors and earthy and spicy notes and . Has that characteristic GI BCS big oily, thick mouthfeel. Not showing signs of oxidation, this beer has many good years left in it.

Aromatics of warm leather, coffee, barrel char, some more coffee with bourbon barrel wood. Not so much heat to show in it's nearly 13% body. It's still a slow glass to get through. And worth every bit of the time. The Black Cat Espresso Beans are part of an earthy chocolate taste. Rich. Fudgy almost with a moderate amount of carbonation which allows it to warm up into a gentle sipper.   Nothing wrong with this one. i.e. No bad news here.   Really well done.

Creamy mouthfeel that you would expect and want from it too. Great brew.

Nice for once a year. yb

Maybe I had good beer karma. It doesn’t matter. I got one and I opened it 12/2/2017 after dinner. See my instagram beerdjk1    OK the review:  Look: jet black, like a stout, like an imperial stout.   Smell: coffee first then bourbon on the “after smell” (it is the coffee variant !)  The coffe aroma is not strong, its balanced.  Feel: as usual ALWAYS PRIVATE on my reviews. We don’t talk about feel in public!    Taste: WELL.... “Hey Now” Smooooth ! The coffee is “off the rails good” bourbon not up front but balanced with the coffee.  At Room temp the bourbon becomes more present but does NOT take over the taste.  Great cold and at room temp.  And being totally Biased, great with the brownies my daughter made tonight.   YES I said this: Pairs great with homemade brownies!    Overall: IMHOpinion wow wow wow. And one more wow.maybe 2.  I personally enjoyed this beer.   One for the books because I don’t know if i will ever get the chance to acquire this variant again.    And that my review.  Djkman

The nose is rich with the aroma from the barrel. The barrel aroma is mixed with a touch of coffee.   Taste - The coffee is more up front, then the barrel heat kicks in, but it isn't a harsh taste, it is a smoother flavor.   Feel is quite thick and full bodied.   A delicious beer, and I'm glad I've finally gotten to try it. It is a world class stout, and the addition of coffee, just adds a new layer to this world class beer.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Was able to grab 3 bottles on Black Friday and first time having it. Started around 55F and warmed to low 60s by end:    L: Pours thick, jet black in the glass (tulip). Suprisingly minimal head retention, but that could've been a bad pour in my part    S: Smells like a fudge brownie, no seriously. Can definitely smell some slight bourbon notes. Actually not getting a ton of coffee on the nose     F: Per many imperial stouts, mouthfeel is velvety smooth, but not as thick as others I've had before. Thinned out slightly as it warmed I guess    T: Definitely packs a flavor punch. Started out tasting dark chocolate, caramel and vanilla. Backend was a little boozy from the bourbon. As it warmed about 10 degrees the espresso definitely opened up as well as slight vanilla. The oaky/smokiness of the bourbon barrels did fade as it warmed.     Overall, this is an outstanding beer that should definitely be enjoyed over the course of about 30-40 minutes. The flavors of coffee open up as it warms and definitely makes this a world class beer.

Getting all the aromas of BCBS -- dark chocolate, dark fruit, berry, vanilla, caramel, toffee -- along with rich nutty coffee, shredded coconut, and marshmallow overtones.   T -- Rich chocolate, bourbon-infused cherries, oak, vanilla, toffee, caramel, molasses, smokey maple syrup. The coffee is pushed around by the other flavors and comes in waves instead of dominating the brew, which is good. Also getting some nougat, roasted barley malt, and sea salt  F -- Same as BCBS. Viscous. Big.   O -- Great addition to an already great stout. Decadent as all hell    95/100

Smells of strong espresso, caramel, roasted malts, bourbon, and dark fruits. Tastes of espresso (not too much though), sweet chocolate, wood, bourbon, light caramel and toffee, dark fruits (plum, raisin), lots of sweetness, and very light vanilla. Heavy body with light carbonation. Overall probably one of the best if not the best barrel aged imperial stout I've tried. Superior to both BCSs.

Plenty of booze and barrel reminiscent of regular bcbs, with a strong roasty coffee presence. Taste follows the nose well. Big charred oak. Roasted coffee notes contribute to a bitterness that balances with the chocolate sweetness. Slight bourbon bite in the back end. Mouthfeel is relatively thin, a tad thinner than reg bcbs. Overall pretty solid, nice showcase of coffee. Only complaint is the mouthfeel, it seemed to be a bit watered down.

Tastes like the richest coffee imaginable, roasted malts, notes of rich dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, sweet bourbon, oak, some dried fruit, molasses, with earthy herbal grassy pine.

Pours black with dark brown head. Big time coffee on the nose with bourbon. On the taste the coffee is much more prominent than the bourbon. Still with bourbon flavor. Chocolate, caramel, toffee, vanilla flavors also present. This might be my favorite bourbon stout. Excellent!

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 This has been a want forever. Shout out to @dharmelink for the trade hookup.    L - 2016 bottle into a snifter. Thick, quick foaming and even quicker dissapating khaki head. I'm perplexed by how quick it formed and how remarkably quick it dissappeared. Lacing is stupid sticky and viscous.    S -Damn. As soon as I cracked it I said wow. Signature bcbs potent bourbon with definitive coffee in the air. To the nose it's a heavy, deep, dark roast with all the vanilla and sweet goodness of classic bcbs.    T - Um. I don't care if AB brews this or not. Good is good and great is great. Literally everything I hoped. It's bcbs with a perfectly and completely unabtrusive balanced coffee added in. I hate descriptor buzzwords such as "smooth" and "balanced" but I must use the latter. The coffee is so prominent without overtaking the iconic bcbs flavor extravaganza. Bcbcs also has an addition roast/char/bitterness that regular bcbs doesn't that could be easily overlooked.    F - Just like like it's lineage it's big, thick, sticky and clinging to the palate. Arguably why I love bcbs so much and this variant characterizes just it as well.    O - Stellar. However as great as it is I'm not sure or not if it's actually better than bcbs. It's more scarce - yes. But as someone who generally prefers non coffee BB stouts I feel like this is pretty equal.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours black with only a tiny ring of fizz rising to the top even after an aggressive pour straight into the glass. The tiny bit of fizz doesn't retain long, nor is there any lacing left behind. Aroma is jam packed with notes - bourbon, oak, coffee, molasses, caramel, and roasted malts. Quite the aromatic quality to this beer. It's loud, with the bourbon note being just shy of a boozy. Flavor profile is massive. Absolutely massive. Big, smooth bourbon notes hit first and linger throughout the flavor profile. Rich caramel, toffee, molasses, milk chocolate, and coffee provide a barrage of flavors, and yet don't step on the toes of each other. Bourbon is present, and while it nears a fleshy, and boozy quality, it manages to remain within balance. Mouth feel is thick, filling, velvety, and creamy. Overall, for those seeking bourbon and coffee in a thick, heavy presence - this is your beer. Despite the complexity of this beer in both the aroma and flavor profile, every note is struck well and given a full beat to ring out.     Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16.9oz bottle. 2016 version.

Smell is like you've poured a glass of bourbon while sitting in an aromatic coffee bar, while chocolate and vanilla waft over from the bakery section. (Sorry, that was a terrible way of putting it but you get the idea: the smell is fantastic.). Taste more or less follows, but the coffee is especially dominant, the chocolate and vanilla less so, the bourbon somewhat (to me pleasantly) subdued or at least moderate. Mouthfeel is, as everyone notes thick and chewy. Great beer, so glad I could have one. I'd snag another if I saw one, even at the high price.

Coffee was smooth and subdued, and the fudgy, chocolatey malt flavors go well with the thick, chewy texture. Lacks the fruity depth of the regular BCBS, but as a whole different beast, it fits the bill deliciously well.

Kind of fizzy with no head  S - Deep notes of chocolate, bourbon, coffee, toffee, and vanilla  T - The taste is coffee, lots of chocolaty fudge, with a bitter sweetness on the finish. There is a bit of roast char in the middle. I find it ever so slightly more robust than BCBS.  F - very thick and chewy almost sticky.  O - Tons of flavor. I find it more well rounded than BCBS. Maybe a little less alcohol bite.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Found this at amy local bottle shop and just had to pick it up since I had never tried it before. I've loved getting the straight up BCBS, so I figured I needed to try this one as well in order to round out the 2015 releases. This beer pours a pitch black hue that is opaque with just a slight bit of carbonation visible around the edges. The head is dark khaki and frothy, dissipating slowly to a ghost thin layer of lacing that is retained. 4.5/5 The aroma is quite strong and boozy, but it features some very sweet notes as well. Notes of toffee, espresso, dark chocolate, and char really dominate with slight undertones of tobacco and leather. The espresso/coffee is easily noticeable and is quite strong. 4.25/5 The flavor is quite boozy and bitter. I would recommend letting this one warm up to room temp first before opening it since warmer temps seem to kill off the bite. Toffee and espresso jump out right away before a light undertone of dark chocolate comes in to round off the dark roasted/slightly sweet beginning. The char, tobacco, and leather seem to come out more in the middle with a bourbon caramel note leading the way in the final third. The finish is quite bitter and boozy with the abv really showing itself. 3.75/5 A slight carbonation tickle hits the tongue right away before a light dryness rears its head and pushes through all the way to the finish, which sees the dryness lingering for quite some time on the palate. This is easily a full bodied beer that does not drink quite as heavy as many stouts that I have had, but it is still very heavy. 4/5 Very good barrel aged coffee stout here, but the booziness and bite really throw me off. I thought that the coffee might drown out some of the booziness but I was wrong. It's still there in all its glory. Like I said in the taste section above, let this one warm up to room temp before opening. Doing so helps to cut the bite of the booze. 4/5

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Darker than my dead soul. Even with almost nothing left in the glass you can't see through it. No head.    Smells of coffee, chocolate, and a bit of bourbon.     Could be me, but I was expecting more coffee on the tongue. Lots of chocolate, a bit of sweet bourbon, no burn.     The mouthfeel is what really sets this apart from so many other BA stouts. Thick and viscous, if you can chug a beer like this then you're likely one of those insane professional eaters that puts down 50 hotdogs at Nathan's Famous every 4th of July. I'm about an hour into drinking this thing and I'm only halfway through it simply do to the thickness of the liquid.    Overall, it's a great beer, and I'm quite happy to have found a bottle, but I'm not sure it's worth the trade value that a lot of people give it. It's mass produced, but eclipsed by a few other coffee stouts, and some non-BA stouts like Abraxas. That isn't to say that I would pass it up if a bottle shop offered it to me, simply that I wouldn't give up a valuable piece from my cellar for a bottle like a few people have done.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 2016 version poured into a snifter.    The beer is pitch black with almost no head on it. A small amount of tan lacing gets left on the glass throughout.    Lots to love regarding the smell of this beer. Dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, finished off with a hint of bourbon.    The taste follows right where the nose left off. TONS of coffee flavor up front, followed by chocolate, and a very smooth bourbon bite on the end. Perfectly balanced beer!    This beer has a thick mouth feel - chewy, sticky, almost candy-like on your lips.     Overall, fantastic is all I can say! Definitely my favorite variant of Bourbon County and I can't wait to see how these bottles will mature over time, not that it needs to improve at all!   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 First time diving into a Bourbon County variant other than the Barley.    2016 Edition    Look is typical bourbon county. The only difference hear is absolutley no head. Beer is pitch black, pours like motor oil.    Smell is coffee, bourbon, mollases, booze, dried currant. Really nice.    Taste is dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee, oak, bourbon, dried fruits. Nice roasty flavor on the back end. A real nice tasting beer to say the least.    Feel is velvety, chewy, thick. Leave a stickiness on your lips. Again really nice.    Overall bourbon county rarely disappoints. I'm usually not one to jump on the InBev bandwagon but this is always one set of beers that will rarely let one down.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 2016 version. Poured into a snifter. Thick, jet black pour. Little to no head, but trace remnants of dark tan lacing. Notes of fresh coffee, a little wood and vanilla, mostly bourbon on the nose. Syrupy, roasted coffee, chocolate, vanilla and malted flavors, with a boozy bourbon backbone, and a balanced coffee finish. Low carbonation, ridiculously smooth, relatively thick and sticky. My first BCBS variant, and it lived up to expectations.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Pitch black pour. Slight medium brown head that dissipates immediately. The aroma is fantastic. Massive notes of bourbon, chocolate, oak, vanilla, and dark roasted coffee. The taste follows and is phenomenally complex. Perfect blend of coffee, bourbon, chocolate, fudge, vanilla, oak. Full bodied, low-moderate carbonation, and smooth. Balanced finish. Superb.

At first there were strong nose of coffee but it soon weened off into straight bourbon. Taste was of a common bourbon barrel, nothing special to it. I will be honest and say that I was disappointed in this beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2016 version. Aroma carries only a little of the coffee notes. Taste is surprising light on the bourbon and is a nice balance with the coffee. Feel is on par with what a barrel aged stout should be, definitely not too thin. I cannot say it is heads and shoulders above other BA coffee stouts I have had, but is an excellent offering from Goose Island.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 2016 version and it was my first. Easily one of the best coffee stouts I've ever had. Lots of aroma and great flavor. Just a top notch brew for anyone who likes strong stouts.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 I still prefer the OG to this. Great stout with plenty of coffee character. The body is as full as the standard Bourbon County. Smells heavily of coffee and roasted malt. I'd love this give this one another go; however, if offered the choice between Coffee and Regular, I'd stick with the regular.

A rough pour yields a small dark khaki head; almost no lace.     Rich roasted coffee, smooth vanilla & bourbon heat in the nose.     Medium thick, sticky mouthfeel.     Rich roasted coffee, mocha syrup & faint vanilla flavors; booze heat emerges as this warms. Another month or two would likely help this, as the heat & the coffee notes don't meld perfectly, but it's still damn good.

Notes of caramel, chocolate, bourbon. Smooth, nicely balanced.     F- The one slight disappointment. Pours pretty thin. However, it has a decent richness on the palette. Fairly high carbonation.     O- I'm not really a coffee, guy, but this is really good. Now I wish I had grabbed more than one, or had some of the vintages.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 2016 bottle drank fresh and poured in to a tulip snifter. Pours a tad thin and carbonated heavily from an aggressive pour but almost immediately dissipates leaving nothing behind. The smell is a coffee bomb upon first pour. The barrel is barely noticeable initially but starts to become more prevalent as it warms. The coffee starts to integrate in to the smell and the vanilla, boozy, and roasty notes of the barrel start to come to the forefront of the nose; deliciousness. The coffee variant is much more balanced than the regular which can be a bit cloying, especially this year. You still get the sweet caramel notes of the base beer on the front end but it is perfectly balanced by the bitterness and acidity of the coffee on the back end. The boozy flavor of the barrel as well as the vanilla notes also come through in the taste much like the smell. It is thick and chewy like a barrel aged stout should be but it is a tad thin. It also has to sit for a bit to let the carbonation dissipate and the mouthfeel to become more coating and let the flavors develop. Overall this is the best of bourbon county's lineup (outside the variants which could be hit or miss). Perfect balance of big stout, barrel, and coffee to bind it all together. Only knock is it is a tad thin this year.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 2014 version, cellared 2 years  A - Pours very dark brown, small head that quickly disappears.  S - Aroma is strong and not coffee at all. More dark fruit than anything else.  T - Had a couple sips then allowed to warm. Coffee flavor is not overwhelming, very well balanced with dark chocolate flavor. Any alcohol that might have been noticeable when new has completely calmed down.   M - Carbonation is low. Mouth feel is almost perfect, beer coats the mouth and sticks. Wow.  O - This is a wonderful beer. Coffee doesn't hit you over the head, it's just part of the flavor profile, and I think I like that best. Give me more!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 2016 version. Had a 5-6 oz pour at the GI Clybourn Black Friday tasting event.  About the only thing I could complain about is it seems a little thinner than regular BCBS, and has a little less head. I'll take the great coffee taste, which really blends well with the BCBS profile.

Appearance: Deep, dark, reddish brown with a slight froth of tan foam.    Smell: Roasted coffee atop grains and caramel and slight balsamic vinager.    Taste: Mildly infected, but still drinkable. Great roast coffee notes, molasses and dark barley against lactic tartness - both tasty, but not an ideal pairing.    Mouthfeel: Medium body and caebonation; light relative to its deep flavor.    Overall: Terrific roast coffee notes setup for a fantastic pairing, but infected tartness detracts from the otherwise toasty, boozy stout base. Still drinkable, just not all it could be.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 2013 Vintage. Bottle dated 11/15/13, purchased that Black Friday, and carefully aged for nearly 3 years.    Poured into Lawson's Finest Liquids tulip glass.    L: Almost no head on pour, whatever there was is gone in a flash. No lacing, only a thin ring around the edge. The beer is very dark and opaque even when held up to a light bulb. You can see tiny carbonation bubbles rising at the very top.    S: Nose is almost all coffee. I let it warm to see if something else would start coming through; some hints of unsweetened cocoa and vanilla start coming through as it warms. Maybe a tiny bit of the caramel malt as well.    So far it's well above-average, but I'm not absolutely overwhelmed or anything. Here goes...    T: Coffee, but far less assertive than you'd expect from the nose (an effect of aging?). Unsweetened cocoa, chocolate, caramel, vanilla. Malts of the base stout. The tiniest bit of alcohol heat on the finish, barely noticeable and well integrated into the entire taste. So yeah, this is pretty great.    F: Full-bodied, the tiniest bit of carbonation. Impeccable construction and balance, augmented by the mellowing of aging. ABV well-disguised, acid of coffee balanced with sweetness of base stout.    O: So, so, so got paid off for my patience on this. I did not try a new bottle of 2013, so I have nothing to compare it with, but I can sense some differences from the base stout in softening and integration of flavors.    This is simply fantastic. All praise to the brewer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Pour is viscous motor oil with mini fizzy bubbles coating the surface clingingly as a half finger head, leaving walls of dark tan lace, fizzling out to a thin ring.    Fudge, brownie and a mocha coffee nose open things up quite promisingly. A nice oak presence adds some spice to the aroma, but it's not hot. Vanilla develops over time.     At first gulp, I notice a smooth heat tickle the back of throat and tease the ears, but not burn. I'm tasting chocolate covered raisins, fudge, and oak. Roasted malt is pretty well integrated and is neither overpowering nor snuffed out. Salted roasted almonds pop in as it warms.    A fizzy tangy intro leads to a medium to full-bodied mouthfeel, with a slight drying effect to the roof of the mouth.     While I've had small portions of this a few times here or there, this full review is based on a bottled 2013 Vintage enjoyed on 10/09/2016.    ---    On 11/22/17, I enjoyed the freshest version of this I've ever had, which also happened to be its first time ever being on draft in Ohio. The coffee was really intense on the nose and tongue, as if freshly ground, with a bit of a mocha angle, but more peanutty and airy, yet still leaving room for that classic BCBS maple to peak through. It was also a little more slick and dry than the regular and Knob Creek Reserve versions I had along with it. In November 2018 I opened another bottle from 2017, and it had become more earthy and roasty, with much less of that fresh ground airy element, thus it had aged well and actually tasted even better.

Not as smooth as regular BCBS though.

It is thick, sludgy and hard to drink. The alcohol is pronounced. I can smell it a little too much. While I can taste coffee, its not the best coffee ever. both Founders KBS and Rushing Duck Imperial Beanhead have better coffee flavors. If I ever order a glass, I can't even make it halfway through a 12 oz pour. Some people like BCS, and I really love stout's but this one is the pits.

Smell has a hint of coffee followed strongly with watermelon and something repugnant.    Taste is a complete wrecking ball. A fully unbalanced sour that has me cussing.    Feel is immediate carbonation followed by the thinness where the sour lives.    If this were on tap I would try it again. For now, crying about the other bottle yet to be opened and putting myself through the torture again just to see if I got lucky.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 No label information. Brewed in the style of an American Imperial Stout aged in Bourbon Barrels with coffee added. Available in 16.9 oz. (500 ml.) bottles, previously 12 oz. bottled 4 packs and on limited release draft. 2015 release.    Poured from a 16.9 oz. (500ml.) bottle to a snifter glass.    (Appearance) Pours a crisp, foamy head of a dark caramel tone over a very dark brown, near black body. Retention is below average and lacing is light and spotty. 3.75    (Smell) Earthy coffee bean atop a toasted bread, caramel syrups and moderately roasted barley with a soft underlying sweetness. Potency is moderate. 4    (Taste) Earthy roasted grains, coffee beans and caramel syrups with undertones of chocolate. There is a discernible acidity and tanginess lingering in the background, noticeable and does not generate an enjoyable impact on the overall flavor. Finishes slightly acidic, grainy, and tart. 3.5    (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, medium oily, slightly chalky, medium dry. Carbonation is moderate, generating a medium frothiness and a medium crisp finish. Body is shy of medium for the style, shy of heavy overall. Balance is slightly tangy, acidic and earthy over sweet. Alcohol presence is mild and there is a distinctive impact from what suggests to be a potential bottle infection. 3.5    (Overall) I've sampled this beer on draft enough to know what it is an is not, and this bottle suffers from a clear infection, which is unfortunate considering the new repackaging job that makes it more expensive than ever. I'll consider revisiting this beer next year and hopefully these issues will be corrected. 3.5    Goose Island Beer Co.'s  Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout  /5.00

The coffee is still there as well in the taste. Its presence masks the sweetness from the normal BCBS. In its place is bitterness and a tinge if acidity from the coffee.     I like my stouts with moderate amounts of coffee, if any at all. I was expecting something different based on the high reviews. However, this is pretty much the same as all others I've had. The base beer doesn't help much when there is simply so much coffee added and is overpowering. If they tone down the amount of coffee added, I think this would be much better.

No lacing is seen on the glass.     Smell: Smells like coffee and bourbon! Smells less intense than the regular BCBS.     Taste: a ton of roasted coffee up front with a blast of barrel and a ton of caramel on the backend. Less sweet than the regular but delicious in it's own right.     Feel: Feels a bit thin compared to the regular but it feels very smooth and rich for a coffee stout. Definitely on the lighter side for a BA stout.     Overall: This was a fantastic gamble. Bought this and 4 BW off a buddy for $30 and this makes it worth that price to me. He even threw in a Perennial Aria as an extra! I'm looking foward to cracking the barleywines in the near future and hoping for the best!

For those that bought in quantity and don't go looking for the latest infected beer news, they might have not have had a chance to send theirs back for a refund or exchange. Pretty sad the very short time frame that Inbev allowed for this, especially when the bottle clearly says "condition up to 5 years". These beers are known to get better with age, and those of u who age them, their most loyal customers, 3 months just don't cut it for a fair time-frame to get their money back.

Taste delivers a massive dose of coffee with a healthy amount of bourbon, mild oak, tons of chocolate malt and two row. Its a huge beer, but very enjoyable despite its heft. There's vanilla in there too. Very chewy, my favorite version of bourbon county. Sucks I heard they had an infection this year, but I didn't even bother, so I haven't had a compromised one.

No bourbon flavor at all due to the intense sour notes.. I had to drain pour the entire bottle after a few sips. Disappointed with how GI handled the situation as well, with the unclear deadline for refunds. I will not be standing in line next year, that's for sure.

Appearance- from a hardy pour this thing comes out like motor oil .Black in color. little head that dissipates quickly. leaves no lacing.     Smell- pure booze. booze and chocolate. not getting any coffee notes which is a bummer.    Taste- from the look and smell I was worried I've wasted five years aging this brew but the taste is prolly the best thing about this beer. you do get a heavy alcohol smack at first but then the chocolate comes in to make you feel all better. the coffee is well hidden. alil disappointing being a coffee stout but it's there. you really have to taste for it.     Mouthfeel- heavy bodied. like I said it was like pouring motor oil. carbonation is still holding on but another year or two it would be dead. really not too shabby for the age or style.     Drinkability- I can knock down this bomber no prob. glad i'm not drinking another one tho.     Overall- I wonder if this was fresher the coffee notes would be more pronounced but aged 5 years it's well hidden. still a good imperial coffee stout but for me I don't get the hype or would say this is something to queef over. good sipper but to me not worth the hype nor price. I remember paying 6 or 7 bucks for this bomber pre-Budweiser sellout.

The look is average compared to other Stouts but it makes up for it in taste.    Smells boozy with chocolate. Roasted coffee and nutty and maybe a touch of vanilla.     Tastes great, a touch boozy, but the bourbon barrel is nice. It's not over done at all.     Mouth feel is medium bodied and smooth. Surprising smooth with the bourbon barrel.    Overall it's very good. Much easier to find now than previous years. I think a lot of bourbon Stouts are catching up to BCBS, but still a very good beer and worth putting in your cellar. Look forward to this one next year and seeing how it changes,

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 An exceptional beer, especially it's color, aroma, and viscosity. For me, at least, this most recent release was a little thin on flavor and had a touch of sourness that weaker/poorer coffee does. Luckily the predominant flavors of the base beer took over after that. Still, overall I'd rather have the (more) common version.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 2015 bottle. Date code: 17/SEP/15 1334 12.4% abv    Only got 1 bottle and debated whether or not to cellar. I'm glad I opened it, as this would have been a huge letdown given the high expectations for BCBS. Called and requested refund.    Did not have a gusher as some had reported but opened in the sink just in case. The pour looks nice with a quarter finger tan head that dissipates almost completely in about 10 seconds.  The nose is still very good. Vanilla, chocolate, and bourbon, although the coffee is subtle.    Unfortunately, the taste has got some very pronounced and inescapable sour notes, especially on the back end. I feel I may have gotten luckier than some on the extent of the lacto infection, although I'm afraid it may still be a partial drain-pour. I've been sipping on it for well over an hour and still have almost half the bottle left.    Overall, Goose Island gets some bonus points for offering refunds, but the bottled CoffeeStout and Barleywine should probably have never hit the market to begin with if any infection was suspected. That being said, I will still probably go hunting for the 2016 batch.

The nose is outstanding. Still tons of coffee even after a year in the bottle. The first few minutes were overpowered by coffee in a good way.     Taste follows the nose quite well. Tons of coffee flavor in the first half of the glass. As it warmed up, more of the dark fruit and molasses flavors you would expect from regular started coming through. If I could have done it over, I would have drank the whole thing cold while the coffee flavors still overpowered everything else.     Mouthfeel is just what you would expect from and bcbs. Thick and chocolatey.     Overall, one of the best beers I have had. Will be fighting the lines in years to come to score bottles of coffee

Higher carbonation on the pour, thinner body, and the taste was sour cherry and salt. The head sizzled like a steak in a hot pan of oil. Had to drain pour it which was extremely disappointing. This has been a reoccurring problem with the 2015 BCBCS's and GI had to give refunds through February of 2016. I was able to call and get a refund check mailed to me. Hoping for better quality control next year.    2013 release, dated 11/15/13. Enjoyed 1-1/2 years later. Pours black with a medium sized dark brown head; some lacing. Smells strongly of bourbon, coffee, and rich cocoa. The taste follows exactly, but in waves of complexity; first the bourbon, then the coffee, then the cocoa, with an amazing bittersweet finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and the carbonation is medium for the style. Not all that different from the regular BCBS. Definitely a world-class beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Draft  L: Balck with a thin tan head. Head retention is good for the ABV. Alcohol lacing and bubbles sticking to the glass.  S: Could the glass but I'm not picking up much on this beer. Mostly I get a heavy booze smell, similar to smelling a spirit. Behind that, there is roast and coffee, but its mild.   T: Bourbon, toffee, caramel, dark chocolate, marshmallow, and roasted malt; all things I get in normal BCBS. However, in the finish there is a mild roasted coffee which blends with the other flavors. Not over the top coffee, but it smooths the flavors well. No booze in the taste, but a nice warming alcohol feeling. As it warms, more chocolate and fudge comes out, along with some nuttiness.  F: Creamy and smooth, and sugary and sticky on the finish. This is a great sipping beer.  Overall, the look, taste, and feel of this beer on what I expect from Bourbon County, rich and decadent. The absence of aroma is somewhat of a mystery.

Impressive that the bourbon is so muted. Medium body and little carbonation, but starts to wake up as it warms. Nice balanced feel, minimal bitterness.     Taste follows, just tons of coffee flavors, then some sweets - maybe some cocoa and vanilla - and then the bourbon closes the show. Goes down ridiculously smooth.     Overall there's not much bad you can find here. As long as you know that it's a coffee stout, you will love this.

The bourbon notes were reduced on this beer compared to regular BCBS.

S - Green coffee, not much else.  T - Bitter coffee, booze. Tart cherries? Salty? Something's off.  M - Medium body, almost thin. Wish it was more on the slick/viscous side.  O - Disappointing. For all the accolades and lofty rating, this not only did not live up, it was flat-out bad, pure and simple. There's an odd salinity to it, which clashes with the slight tart cherry finish, and tastes nothing like the base BCBS I had a few weeks ago. I can't imagine any of these undesirable characteristics were intended, but it doesn't change the fact that this was a terrible beer. It gets worse as the beer warms...

I can't say there were any off flavors or anything like that, and it definitely was good, just not that good. And that's not even bringing price into the picture, which I always try to avoid when reviewing a beer. All in all, I've wanted to try this beer for years, and now that I have, I doubt I'll ever have it again.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 first reviewed 2015 version. No gusher, no infection. Maple syrupy color. Coffee on the nose. Coffee and barrel on the taste. Sweet, no bitterness of coffee. Well balanced. Super tasty.  Look 4.5 Smell 4.25 Taste 5 Feel 4.25 Overall 4.75 for rating of 4.67    2013 version would be even higher rated, as the bourbon notes on the smell make up for less coffee, and it's an extremely smooth and very easily sippable barrel aged beer.    2017 is in between the two.    Trying 2013 again on January 1, 2019, and it's 5 across the boards. Pours dark with a gusher of tan foam. Smell is sublime-coffee and barrel coexist on equally pleasant levels-not overly strong, not weakened by age. Taste is an intense blast of coffee and barrel over the malty roasty base. Slightly sweet notes of vanilla and chocolate are underneath everything. Feel is smooth. No oiliness, just the right amount of barrel heat, super sippable. Wow.     Adjusting the score between all the vintages I've had to the above.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 2015 bottle. Took my sweet time with this one! Pours a dark mahogany/motor oil color. No head, just a lingering and persistent tan, root beer foam colored ring. Smells like bourbon, coffee, black licorice. Slightly astringent, but not in a bad way. Tastes like deeply roasted coffee and booze. Very sweet and raisin-y. Feels a little slick on the tongue. Counter-intuitively, the carbonation on this seem to grow as this beer warmed up. Overall great beer. No sign of infection on this one. Wish I could have tracked down more than one.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Loved the '13 and '15 equally. Pleasant thick mouthfeel, but less than expected considering it's ABV. Nice carb and definite sweetness. However, the aroma of green bell peppers detracts from what would've been a near perfect coffee beer. Falls short of Caffe Americano's perfect distillation of coffee flavor.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours deep brown with an oatmeal head. Overpowering coffee aroma bursts from the tasting glass. Bright sharp red fruited coffee aromas, followed by same on the palate, along with more roasty chocolatel flavors. Bourbon sweetness followed by coffee bitterness.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Bottle of 2015, 1902 bottling time  L: black pour with a tan-auburn head. Fades to thin lacing at the edges of the glass against. Ruby-brown color at the edge, otherwise opaque black  S: I could smell the coffee before it even was poured. The bourbon comes out well but not overpowering, offset by hints of vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, marshmallow.  T: fudgy brownie, with more bourbon and hints of dark fruit and raisins. I've been getting this taste in stouts recently so I think it's my tastebuds going through a phase. Touch of bitterness at the end, not sure if from coffee or hops.  F: very thick, syrupy.  O: no signs of infection here! I think I might still prefer the base bourbon county over this, as the coffee they chose is quite complex and brought a host of interesting notes with it, some of which distract from the underlying stout

I literally felt myself getting smarter and hipster-cupping worthy. The coffee hangs on throughout the drink too, playing well with the roast. Pretty aggressive roastiness--a tiny bit more bourbon sweetness would have helped keep the gnarliness down, but ba speedway offers that. I think this is the better of the two bc of the drinkability. Cup this.

Pours a beautiful almost dark black, no light is going to get through this sucker. The nose on this one is one of the most complex and well rounded I have had in a while, huge chocolate, huge coffee with touches of dark dried fruit and sweet vanilla. Taste is off the charts, milky but roasty, lots of the aforementioned coffee and chocolate flavors, sweet vanilla and slight dark dried fruits (prunes, dates, raisins etc), just a 100/100 if there ever is one!

Nice dark coloration, with a thin head that dissipates immediately. Doesn't appear to coat the glass like the regular BCBS does, though it does leave some legs. Massive green pepper on the nose, so much so that it covers up most anything else, there is a bit of roasted malt or coffee aroma. The flavor starts out with a burnt coffee flavor, with a very sour finish, almost like sour cherries, and a uncharacteristically thin body. It would appear this beer is infected with some sort of wild yeast or bacteria judging by the sourness and loss of body and mouthfeel. Which sucks as the bcbcs was always my fav variant. This beer is a shadow of it's former self. I see other people mentioning the green pepper and sourness, yet still rating the beer over a 4.0...what's up with that?    *****  Pours a dark black color, with just a touch of amber on the edges when held to a light. Not much head to speak of, more of a brown colored sudsy layer, that forms a small, bubbly ring.    The aroma definitely has a coffee, vanilla and bourbon quality. However it's much more than just that, there are deep caramel notes, brown sugar and espresso. Just rich and creamy, I can tell there is some definite complexity to this beer.    The flavor is intensely complex. You're hit initially with a well developed espresso flavor combines with bouzy bourbon notes and a rich creamy quality. It finishes with a well developed a burn that doesn't overpower the roasted, bitter coffee flavors that round this beer out.    Full bodied and creamy mouthfeel. BCBCS really is impressive. So complexly flavored and I love that the coffee character can stand out amongst all the bourbony goodness. It is quite rich so I certainly can't drink much of it, but really who cares?

Blind, I would have been torn between whether or not this was a straight up coffee stout or someone had blended Backyard and BCBCS.

A little chocolate and coffee, but mostly a boozy bourbon    T - Big time layers. Coffee, then bourbon, then sweet dark chocolate with a finish mostly of milk chocolate. Really nice path for the whole flavor profile and all of these flavors are surrounded by a nice charred oak flavor. A lot going on.    M - thick, sticky, and viscous. Absolutely coated my mouth. No booze at all and highly drinkable.    Overall this was a great coffee ba stout.  I love the coffee flavors this year as they seem much more potent and bold. That said, it does cause for a little more overpowering than I prefer as I love that normal balance of coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. I see this coming together in about 4-6 months. This is all getting very particular and using a very high set bar from previous years and high expectations. This really is a tremendous beer, and I am glad I have a few more to see how the flavors continue to develop. Keep up the great barreling work GI!

Smells oaky, vanilla, mild coffee smell. Taste is superb. The coffee really combines well with the aged bourbon. This is one of the best beers I've had. I would like to try one with less aging to compare to get more coffee flavor.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 12 FL. OZ. bottle  Served in a snifter  2014 vintage    This beer pours black. There were some mocha bubbles on top for a second. They disappeared so quickly I have to try and recall the appearance. It looks almost like ink in my glass.    There is still a nice coffee aroma. I also get vanilla, caramel, and bourbon. It has a dessert smell.    It starts out with coffee and anise. I think the perceived anise is from coffee flavor being a year old rather than fresh. The coffee blends into the vanilla and caramel flavors creating a wonderful tasting experience. The alcohol is well hidden.     Full mouthfeel. Very low carbonation    This is the first Bourbon County that I have gotten to try. While I would love to have had a fresh one, the year old version is very tasty. I think it is similar to an almost year old Sunday Morning Stout that I had recently.

Big smells of coffee, peanuts, bourbon, and some sweet notes, maybe vanilla. The taste is spot on for such a newly bottled beer. Great blend of coffee and bourbon. Hard to tell it has such a high ABV by the way this one goes down. Nice and creamy to the pallet, this is one of the best aged coffee beers of the year!

Personally I thought cellaring would allow to mellow out the flavors and allow the burnt coffee and rich cocoa nib flavors to play off each other better. This was too much black coffee and not enough well rounded beer mouth feel for me. Lot going on in this beer though from the vanilla aromatics

Pours opaque black viscous like 50 weight motor oil!   Thin wisp of dark tan head around rim of snifter.  Aroma of bourbon, coffee, chocolate and a hint of black licorice.  Flavor is dominated by dark rich espresso followed by chocolate and bourbon.  Finishes with a nice alcohol warmth.  Overall a fantastic beer! Typical character of BCBS, but more mellow and round with the addition of coffee.
