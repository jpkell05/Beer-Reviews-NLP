look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 The last of the first 3 impressions, and the one that cemented IPA over Imperial Stout for my overall preference. Stone and Bells are my faves, until I discover a brewery I think is better. My tastes are pretty set after a decade, but change could happen.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.75 Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a nice looking black color with an eggshell white foamy head that slid off at a moderate pace. Sliding semi-stringy lace ran down the glass fairly nice.  The aroma had some roasted almonds, citrus peel, slight grapefruit, then coffee grounds, dark chocolate nibs, and had a slight chalk-like malt backbone.  The flavor had that dry chalky roasty sort of almond to coffee ground taste pretty bold and up front pummeling the dark chocolate further into the background. Super chalky dry/coffee ground aftertaste.  The mouthfeel was about medium bodied, perhaps just a touch under but having a decent sipping quality about it. Carbonation felt appropriate. ABV felt appropriate. Finish was super dry with some citrus, grapefruit and coffee grounds.  Overall, though reviewed fresh, I have to admit, it's not exactly one of the best black IPA's on the market, I guess that's why this got retired.

look: 3.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Look: Solid Pepsi with a bourbon diffuse color and a thick, black in the body. The head is as thin as they come and colored burnt umber. It's definitely odd, especially for an IPA.  Smell: Vibrant Citrus notes of orange peel and cantaloupe. It has a decent presence of roasted malt character with notes of almonds and walnuts.  Taste: Sweet and layered. Stronger malt character than most IPAs. Strong notes of citrusy fruits including grapefruit and orange. Notes of oak with a little bit of spices, bourbon, and a hint of chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Light and carbonated entry with a thicker body. The sweet finish sticks in the tongue making you crave another sip. Dynamic and drinkable but thinner than I'd like.  Overall: a peculiar blend of styles that nails the taste but falls short in it's consistency.

Like biting into a piece of chalk wrapped in powder instant coffee particles. Have another beverage ready to wash out your mouth after drinking this.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours jet black with nice tan head and good lacing. Smell consists of some dark chocolate, hops, and little hit of coffee and a malty zest. Flavor is nice, hops hit you up front with little pine, the malt and bits of chocolate/coffee break into the mix. The finish is dry and hoppy. Overall this is a very pleasant beer, well done Stone.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 12 oz    Pours a clear but very dark brown, looks opaque unless held to light. Head is light tan, pillowy, and dissipates to a lacing.    Smells of toasted biscuit, coffee, and piney and woody hops.    Tastes of pine and honey on toasted biscuit, woody hop finish. Bit of caramel on the follow-up.    Medium to full body with a bite of carbonation on the tongue.    Delicious IPA with some dark beer elements that mesh perfectly. Great pour, great taste, great feel. Nothing is short of excellent. A must-try.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 1 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 2.75 Maybe something's off with my smeller, but I smell very little from this brew. Taste is nice at first, but it has that bit of funky taste that is the reason I don't drink Porters. Not bad, but not something I will drink again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A twelve ounce bottle dated 07/09/16 with enjoy by 11/06/16 poured in a Stone snifter for the review.     Look- Pours a medium thick oily black with a generous finger of tan foam that settles leaving ample lacing.     Smell- Dark roasted malt, pine and some char.     Taste- Dark roast and pine forward followed by solid floral notes and a hint of char in the finish.     Feel- Oily and quite thick like an oatmeal stout with a semi dry finish.     Overall- Not my favorite style, but I found this one rather interesting. It tasted like a blend of stout/porter with an IPA. Worth a shot for fans of the style.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 Definitely not retired: was part of the summer 2016 sampler pack distributed nationwide. Reminds me most of Wookey Jack. Is Jekyll and Hyde in regards to being imbibed straight from the bottle and poured into a glass (the latter is recommended. Without reservation.) The juiciness of the hop profile is alternatingly all-for and against the dark wheat ale profile. It's smoother than your garden-variety bubbly porter, less substantial than a stout. The aftertaste calls for a stronger coffee residue but is somewhat astringent. Has upside. Alcohol is well hidden.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 So happy this is back even if it is just for a limited amount of time.  Appearance is black with a tan two finger head. Some redness as well when held up to light.  Aromas of dark fruits, chocolate, citrus, floral and resiny hop along with some malt sweetness. Really nice and complex.  Tastes are citrus, resiny pine, malt sweetness, chocolate.  The palate is medium plus with a nice creaminess that lingers really well. Big bitterness as well that stays.  Overall this is probably still my favorite beers aer from stone. The best black ipa I have had.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Entry is briefly sweet, then dry cocoa bitterness kicks intermingling with the bitterness from the hop. Hops are fresh, floral, citrus (lemon), pineapple, earthy, woody, resinous, and intense. I love it. Body thickens up slightly as the beer warms. Hops linger on the palate. Alcohol is forward at times and can be a little sharp. This has gone off the market, but was brought back on in a variety pack. One of the better black IPA's out there. Made in the Stone mold- big, brash, in your face. True to style. If you close your eyes, you get IPA all the way and maybe a little of the dark properties, which in an informal way is how the style is suppose to present itself. This is a really nice beer. It's intense, but it's surprisingly drinkable. I was at the bottom of my glass before I knew it. Not a beer for all. If you are a true IPA fan, grab it if you can get it.

Roasted malt n hops fill the nose. Roasty taste, lots of piney bitter hops bite mid way and dominate the rest of the sip. A hop lover's black  IPA. Medium silky feel. Glad they are bringing this one back occasionally.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, about a month after bottling. Pours a deep brown, or mahogany in color. Close to black, but not quite. Head is fairly small (1/4 inch to 1/2), but this is mostly due to my pour, I think, because it's been bigger and more sustained in recent times I've enjoyed this. Lacing however is still pretty present and clings to the side of my glass throughout. Smell is of chocolate and coffee at first, and then of fruity hops. Taste is immediately a roasted quality that leads to more coffee, and some dark chocolate. A slight sweetness, and then a tame, but appreciated hop bite, just enough to stay true to the style. Feel is fairly full bodied and a tad creamy, like a stout of similar strength. Overall, a very tasty and enjoyable beer. Smell was a little more tame than expected, but the layered flavors in each sip more than makes up for what was likely due to a less than perfect pour.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.    L: It pours a one finger head and leaves a pretty decent amount of lacing, and is quite black.    T: I really like the black IPA style to begin with. The taste of this one did not disappoint, with a delightfully hoppy taste with significant toasted malt.     F: Rolls over the tongue pretty much like any of the Stone IPA's, a nice feel.    If this beer were available all of the time, I would buy it regularly.

Stone released this in their Mixed 12 Pack, paired with their classic Stone IPA, Ruination Double 2.0, and their new seasonal Citruy Wit. It pours nearly jet black with about a 1/2 inch head and heavy lacing. You get a mild hoppy, resinous aroma initially, but the first sip is a sweet and hoppy burst of flavor, complimented by bready, malty notes that finishes with a subtle pine flavor that does an incredible job of balancing out the full flavor of this beer. So glad to experience this, would love to see it go into regular circulation. 4.5/5

This is such a unique and flavorful beer, showcasing phenomenal malts with some hops to give it a bite. Renewed my faith in the oft underwhelming black IPA style.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 12oz. bottled 04/30/16    Pours dark maroon, nearly black with a creamy frothy tan head.

The taste is more balanced between the roasted malts and the hoppy characteristics. Piney, resinous, and roasty. Medium light body with moderate-high carbonation. Slightly bitter, dry finish. Really happy Stone brought this back!

However, I can't deny it is full of body and flavor and will make any IPA lover beg for more. The smell of coffee (and maybe chocolate) is pleasant and again makes this a standout among IPAs. If you love your porters and/or IPAs then this is for you. For those of you who shy away...take several steps back.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Nicely done black IPA, lots of roast grain and hop bitterness without being overwhelming.

The appearance was a fairly dark brown color with a one finger off white foamy head that had slow dissipation. Lacing was fairly thick and stuck around for a little bit and then slid into the beer.  The smell started off with roasty burnt caramel and then the big bitter burst of citrus just sharpens under my nose really nicely.  The taste was roasty coffee leading into the semi-roasty to burnt caramel and then somewhat bittersweet through the citrus. A light citric and roasty aftertaste leads into the finish.  The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fairly nice sessionability about it. Carbonation hits nicely on the tongue with enough IBU's showing its respected bitter harshness.  Overall, wondering if I might be the last reviewer of this, slightly saddened to see it go, but hey, there's always other black ales in the sea to minister palate wrecking ability that they tend to have.

Not getting a whole lot from the smell, but roasty caramel malts come through alongside some resinous hops and a bit of alcohol.    Taste is roasty coffee, caramel sweetness (especially when warm), and maybe some bitter-sweet chocolate. The lingering bitterness from the dark malts blends into the bitterness from the hops, which also lend a faint hit of citrus. Mouthfeel is not especially heavy to begin with, and an abundance of carbonation makes it feel even lighter.    Overall it is a tasty brew that, while not mind-blowing, is consistently and reliably delicious. I'm sad to see it go.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Poured from a 22oz. bottle.    A: Pours a deep black with a reddish dark brown appearance when held to light. Head if an inch and half of frothy creamy mocha color. Excellent retention and leaves behind some beautiful lacing.    S: Dark malts, roasted coffee, and caramel upfront. Then I find aromas of citrus, subtle notes of tropical fruits, some alcohol, and a resiny pine hop aroma at the end.    T: Dark malts up front, then a blast of earthy pine hops, and coffee flavors. In the middle you get some dark bread, caramel, and citrus. Finishes with a resinous earthy hop bitterness.    M: Light to medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Slick and smooth fairly easy to drink. I can't help but wish there was more to this though.    O: A great Black IPA and one of those "classic" brews in my opinion. Well balanced and solid I have enjoyed many of these in my life and will enjoy many more.

L - Nice and deep black with a thick, heavy tan head standing a finger and a half high.    S - Burnt coffee, nice roasted maltiness enveloping into toasty warmth.    T - This is where the disappointment comes in. The black coffee and the toasty essence come in, but it doesn't have the punch or embrace the smell lead you on the believe it would.    F - Thick, light to moderate carbonation, lingering coffee for days on end.    O - Good beer, but the taste missed the punch.

Huge head of off-white suds, and thick, ornate, detailed lace all make the initial showing a pleasure.    Aroma: Delicious and balanced, blending chocolate roasty maltiness with fresh fruity, citrusy hops.    Taste: Bold, assertive, and big, with the bitter citrus hops taking precedence over the roasty malts. There are, of course, notes of burnt chocolate in there, adding a subtlety to the big hops. The mix is masterful and this is a downright wonderful brew.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A Black IPA as only Stone could do it. Heavy on the hops with a solid dark and roasty background this was a truly Self-Righteous drinking experience. The beer poured a deep brown with ruby highlights and a very large and robust tan head. The hops hit me immediately with a very citrusy and floral aroma along with a bit of pine resin. The dark malty backbone was lingering beneath the hops, but not as present in the nose. The taste was a full on bitter hop assault with the citrus and pine hop notes that faded into a malty and burnt roasty porter that ended with a burnt and piney bitterness on my palate. The beer was full and creamy which matched well to its appearance and left a pleasant bitter coating on my tongue between quaffs. A really outstanding Black IPA and a shame it will be discontinued.

Heavy lacing is present. Amazing aroma of citrus hops greets the nose. There's undercurrent of dark malt. The taste is of bitter piney hops on the front of the palate. The back of the palate is dark malt. It finishes with a bitter flourish of more piney hops. The mouth is initially creamy and then very dry and lightly sticky. There's a lot going on here. Why is this being discontinued again?

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Pours a dark brown color with a big light brown head. Good retention and a lot of lacing.     Aroma is of pine and sweet caramel malts. A little bit of citrus.    Taste is quite complex. Citrus hops, roasted malts, pine, and caramel malts are all at the forefront. A good amount of alcohol is noticeable. Some very light notes of roasted coffee and chocolate. Smoky. Not too heavy on the hops. Definitely has a porter kind of a feel to it. Relatively bitter. I think the complexity of the taste may actually be a drawback here. It's like they tried to get too many tastes into one beer.    Medium bodied. Low carbonation. A bit sticky. Definitely a sipper.    Overall, although there is a nice, rare balance of citrus and roasted malts in the taste, not quite feeling this one as much as I had hoped. Had a Ruination last night, and preferred it quite a bit more. As previously stated, I think the complexity of flavors actually played against it. Still a very good beer, just a bit disappointed.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Bomber poured into a plastic cup. Appearance is nearly opaque black topped with tan head that has legs but won’t stick to this cup. Aroma consists of citrus hops, pine resin, and roasted malt. Flavors are early citrus peel bitterness, roasty/cocoa malt sweetness in the middle, and a bitter lingering finish. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, crisp yet creamy, slight boozy aftertaste.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip. A flat very dark brownish black with three fingers of firm, creamy light tan head. Leaves a nice sheet of lacing down the glass.     Aroma at once recalls a pungent west coast IPA and an equally robust porter. Huge pine/citrus/melon hop bloom followed by rustic dark malts that recall molasses and charred nuts. On the palate, translates as chalky, dry, slightly nutty, rather thick and creamy. Some fresh grapefruit, tangerine, lime, and cantaloupe notes but less overtly fruity and tropical than some black IPAs. A gentle chocolate and raisin flavor. Pine resins that somehow complement a little charcoal. Warming alcohol burn but this is not overdone. Finishes with equal parts hops and dark malts, a molasses-like sweetness coupled with menthol-licorice lozenge and citrus rind.    Another clear-cut winner from Stone. Impressed by the old school malt emphasis here, considering these guys' rep for hop-forward brews. They got this base covered as well, of course.

S - Grapefruit like hops, alcohol smidge.     T - Building hops bitterness. Lingering hops taste. Small bite of alcohol. After taste is all hops and grapefruit pith.    M - Silky, warming feeling. Light tickle of carbonation on tongue. Smooth and easy if proper temperature. Better warmer.    Very solid. If I wanted an IPA, this would be one I would come back to regularly. Stone has yet to disappoint.

S: Tropical fruit and pine hops, then a little citrus and fruitiness, caramel malt sweetness, and some roasted malt.     T: Pine and citrus hops up front, grapefruit and a hint of orange, some tropical fruit, mango, even some floral and fruity notes, followed with nice roasted malt, coffee, perhaps light chocolate, and a nice caramel toffee sweetness. What didn't they throw into this one?     M: Medium body, lower carbonation, quite smooth. Almost dangerously drinkable.    O: Haven't had this one in a while and I'm now wondering why it isn't a regular. Outstanding black IPA. I'm gonna miss this one when they retire it.

S: Ripe tropical fruit: pineapple, peach, mango, grapefruit.  T: Very hop-forward. Starts off with a kick of grapefruit and pine, with some tropical fruit essences, then the hops simmer down and let toasted malt flavors take over the back of the palate. You don't really taste the malt until the aftertaste.  M: Medium. Hops stick around a while.  O: I liked the hop flavors, but thought the toasted malt could have came through more. It was a little unbalanced on the hoppy side.

There are some great ones out there like the Wookie Jack and Mountain Standard, but they Tremble before the presence of their Blue Demon Labeled Master!!! LOL sorry, I'm just having too much fun here.     Its the Hoppiest of all the Black IPAs I've had and the Black Malt sweetness brings it all home to the most unique flavored Black IPA I've had. it might best too sweet for some Hopheads, but its so hoppy it just doesn't matter. This is what a Black IPA should be. The only Competition is has is something Lagunitas did and I can'remember what its called. Bring on the 5s!!!

Great packaging, hilarious description.  Pours dark, as advertised. Thin head that could be beefier.  Very nice mellow malty odor and taste with a long lingering bitterness and lingering dark (black patent) malt flavors.  The texture is creamy bordering on sticky.  This could be the perfect dark double IPA. Just a few shortcomings, like the head is too thin and the body is a bit too thick and a little smokiness or wood flavors would be welcome additions. Really good.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Poured a rich black body with reddish brown highlights around the edges and one finger of tan head. A gorgeous looking black IPA, quite nice. Scents of pine resin, grassy hops, medium-high levels of roasted malt, light smokiness, light citrus and licorice aromas and light fruity esters and caramel. Overall impression of aroma is of a very nice black IPA, rich and true to form, with a pleasant balance that leans towards hops, but lets enough roasted malt through. Quite nice. Flavor begins nicely bitter, with notes of roasted malt, smoked malt, pine resin, grassy hops, tangerine flesh and citrus peel. This moves into a bitter middle with notes of pine resin, citrus peel and a nice undercurrent of roasted and caramel malt. Finish is highly bitter with notes of pine resin, roasted malt, grapefruit peel and some sweet citrus flesh with a mild note of grassy hops and light alcohol. Aftertaste is bitter with notes of roasted malt, pine resin and grassy hops. Overall impression of flavor is of a very nice, very bold black IPA. It is very hop forward and bold but still quite nice, and with enough malt to balance. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation and a drying, sticky feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice black IPA, like many I have had. Overall this is a pretty good black IPA. It has a good aroma and flavor and a nice mouthfeel that aids the flavor profile. Not as good as the gold standard, Wookey Jack, but still quite nice and a shame it's being discontinued.

Ends bitter to help round off the initial sweetness. Very well balanced.   O - A damned fine, 5 star black IPA.   V - Bought as a single. Unsure of pricing.

The mouthfeel was slightly less harsh than most though, one of the better qualities of the beer. The taste wasn't as much black or IPA as I'd hoped, more alcohol and less malt, hops, or smoke than you'd want. It was good, just a bit disappointing given all of heard.

A: Near black with a deep ruby underlay. One finger of lively tan head. Low retention, quick to fade, tall frothy ring, moderate lacing. Definitely looks the part of a legit black IPA.    S: Bright citrus hops, apricot/orange/tangerine with subtle background noise pine. Roasted, chocolaty malts. Very complimentary aromatics.     T: Matches the aroma, albeit with greater intensity. Roasted notes are dominant with a residual hop back.    M: Low carbonation, smooth, nice balance while keeping traces of bitterness and a roasted character.    O: A well crafted black IPA, one of the best of the style, in the same league as Dubhe/NightTime/Wookey Jack. Perfect for the hop head looking to transition into Porters... or the opposite way around.

Hmm smells like a porter /stout, but what's that end note!?! I'm gonna go for a sip...... WOW!! this is delicious!! Starts off like a porter stout ends like an iPa. I can't explain it. I've actually looked at the low reviews on this one AND THEY EXIST! I know everyone's taste differs but I feel like this is one of the greatest beers ever. If I had enough to spend $12 on a couple 4 packs a week I would, but rather keep it special and get every so often. Hands down best 12oz bottled beer so far in my journey though craft beer. If you like IPAS and don't mind porters /stouts try this. Just make sure you get it fresh and check the dates! Although it is understandable living on opposite coast these days.. Thank you Stone! Please don't stop brewing this. Ever. Cheers, Kevin.

Medium carb.    O: Sometimes black IPAs just don't jive with me because the balance just seems to be off. This one worked very well. Just a really good mix of IPA and dark malt characteristics.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 On tap at Stone World Bistro in Escondido, CA. Served in a stemmed glass 12/14/14.    A- Dark brown body; appears black in the right lighting. Big two finger tan-brown head with long retention time and longevity. Just swirling the glass revives the head in a big way. Lots of lacing.     S- Rich cocoa, milk chocolate, roast comes out at first, and then you get a blast of citrus, floral and pine hops to the face. This beer seems to blast you with both the black, roasty aspect of the base malt and then the fruity, floral scents of the hops. It smells great in the sense that it doesn't bother trying to integrate the two specific aspects of the beer.    F- More hops on the palate than in the nose; although as it warms up, the malt backbone comes out more in terms of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee and roast malts. But overall this is a grapefruit, pine, and floral bomb on top of a chocolate cake. Very nice.    M- Medium bodied, a bit more carbonated than I'd like but it's well within the acceptable range. Slightly prickly, refreshing with a decently bitter finish that evokes both the piney hops and the milk chocolate within.    O- Very nice black IPA; it's very different from Wookey Jack in the sense that Stone unapologetically amps up both the dark roasted malt presence and the hoppiness, while Firestone Walker pays a little bit more attention to integrating the normally-clashing parts of the components of the beers. Either way, these are great beers if you like the CDA style.    Final score: 4.22

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Delicious and smooth. It smells like chocolatey, roasty goodness with some mocha. I wish I could wear this as perfume. The taste matches the aroma, plus great hoppy flavor and bitterness. This is a wonderful, good looking brew that I could drink every day (if not for the price; haven't seen this bomber under 10 dollars around here!), my only complaint is the slight aftertaste. It's a bit astringent and aspirin like, more so than other IPAs/APAs I've had. Still, pretty amazing!

This pours a very dark brown/black color with a foamy light brown head. The aroma is rich and hoppy. The flavor is rich and bold with deep robust tone but still very hoppy. This finishes with an oak after taste and leaves a lingering bitterness. Very well made for the style.

A unique beer unlike anything I've had before. Truly remarkable flavors. Like the bottle implies, you'll hate this if you havent' had an ample sampling of beer over the years, and you may still.   Deep, complex and intricate flavors abound. To bring out some of the complexities in an enticing manner and to truly savor the finish this beer offers, enjoy with a cigar.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.25 Look- Look is exactly what i was expecting from the Oxymoron that is the Black India Pale ale, i expected it to be black with a mocha colored head and thats exactly what it is.     Smell- Smell is insane, imagine you took a super fresh draft guinness and set it on the table then right next to it put a cup of fresh hops and smelled them both at the same time through separate nostrils and thats what you will get with this with a hot scent of liquor in the back.     Taste- Let down, flavors clash wayyyy to hard, it trys to be a stout without a heavy body so you get that chocolate and char taste but then you get extreme bitterness from the hops because its trying to be an Imperial IPA at the same time and they do not flow smoothly o your taste buds, leaves an off flavor in your mouth that thankfully dosnt stick around its very similar to that skunk gross flavor that HopStoopid provides.     Feel- Mouthfeel is great once you get over the fact it taste like complete crap. Fully body feel like a lighter stout but still feels like an IPA mouth.     Overall i won't i wasn't too happy with the beer, i won't ever buy it again nor will i recommend it to anyone who is interested in trying a BIPA. spent 9.99 on a bomber and drank maybe 4 ounces of it before i dumped it all

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Appearance: It has a nice dark brown color to it. It has a nice creamy beige head that dies down slowly and leaves beautiful lacing.    Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of roasted malts, some coffee, bitter pine resins, some caramel, floral hops and light citrus.     Taste: Like the aromas, it has some roasted malts, light coffee, some toasty/caramelly notes, bitter pine resins, light floral hops and faint citrus.     Mouthfeel: It has a low carbonation with a nice overall balance and feel.    Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by good flavors and aromas. I'm not a huge fan of the style to begin with but I must say that this one is quite enjoyable.     Serving type: bottle

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 Pours a pitch black color that's actually a little thinner looking than I am used to. It has a big 3 finger brown head that lingers for a bit before lacing the hell out of my snifter. First smell is fairly hoppy. PIne notes mostly. There are some muted roasty notes in the background. It's pretty muted. First sip is quite similar to the nose. Piney hops. Roasted malt. Some subtle coffee notes in the background. A little char bitterness finished the brew off. There is a pretty clean finish with a low bitterness. It's very drinkable and the alcohol is hidden well. Not one I'd seek out again but that's moreso the fact I don't love the style.

Bang! Love it! Black IPA. Drinks like a stout. Piney hops with roasted malts? Smooth with a hidden bite back that is darn near unnoticeable. Almost chewy if an IPA could be called chewy. Subtle hints of citrus fruit. 12 oz bottle.

Dark, sweet, vanilla notes, chocolate flavor, spices (chicory?), balanced and smooth with a somewhat peaty and toasted malt finish that reminds one of a hearty stout. 8.6/10 not spectacular and doesn't remind one of an IPA, where are the hops?

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a snifter from a bomber. Review from 4/14/14.    Color is black with a thin tan head. Lots of lacing.  Aroma is grassy hops with caramel sweetness.  Flavor is intense piney hops on the palate that mellows to allow some deep roasted coffee to show through. Finish is mildly bitter with a malty aftertaste.  Medium to full body with moderate carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel.    Overall, an excellent example of this style of beer. Definitely in the top tier.

If you think you would like to try a variety of Black IPAs, don't try this one first... it will ruin the genre because you won't find another like it. One of the most enjoyable beers I've ever had.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I am getting into black IPA's, actually, I have been for a while bu this is the first time I have reviewed one.     Appearance: Black, but not totally light free, there is some light that escapes, looks very much like a porter. Not totally black and absorbs light like a Imperial stout, but from a distance you might think that it was.    Aroma: Some hops, burned malts, some caramel sweetness, but nothing like a stout. This is an animal all of its own.    Taste: Hops, bitterness, like a bitter dark chocolate, but definitely like an IPA, but with some charred malts incorporated. It is what you would expect to taste if you blended a pale ale or mild IPA with a light stout or porter. I am intrigued by this combination.    Overall: I like this style of beer, its not better than any of the other ones I have had, but its not really worse. They all are around the same in quality, at least the ones that I have tried. This one is worth seeking out. I have a 4 pack of Founders Dark Penance I am looking forward to trying, I am interested in seeing how this compares.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 I like black IPAs and Stone's offerings so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.     A - Nice rich black color. Off white colored head with fine bubbles and light lacing.    S - Tons of citrusy, hoppy goodness and then some roasty aroma.     T - Great NW hops that provides a ton of flavor coating the palate. There is a sweet roasty character that compliments the hops very well. There is a strong bitterness from both the hops and the roasted malt but there is a sweet malty character that helps balance.   .   M - Moderate mouth-feel. Moderate carbonation. The mouth-feel allows the flavors to be savored and the carb helps the hops pop.    Overall, this is an amazing black IPA. Definitely a beer that I could drink often. I wouldn't want more than a couple at a time due to the tremendous flavor impact and bitterness but it is a tasty brew.     Glass- Snifter

It has a strong hoppiness with noticeable citrus notes. A power fullbodied flavor of hops citrus and chocolate, possibly my favorite beer I've ever had  F:leaves a nice hoops flavor on your mouth that leave you asking for more  O: poured into a glass from a 1 pint 6 fl Oz single serve big boy bottle. Was excited to try this and it way exceeded my expectations a top notch brew.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a Dogfish Spiegelau glass. Bottleneck says Enjoy By 12/05/14.    A- Pours a 99% opaque black color with a 1/2 inch dark tan head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a half sheet of surface foam. Drippy, semi-resilient lacing.    S- Hops, booze and dark roasted malt. The hops are grassy and the booze plays off the malt sweetness to create a brown sugar/caramel quality.    T- All the elements come together in a big wave of semi-astringent aggression where it's all happening so fast you can't pin down which tastes are which. There's some coffee that's cut off by the hop bitterness that's interrupted by the sweetness from the malt that's abruptly diverted by the alcohol. All this chaos comes to an end once the palate acclimates and everything starts to make sense. The hop flavors start to work in harmony with the coffee and char notes that once seemed to be random. The booze bite goes away and the sweetness acts as a mediator between everything else to present the profile's complexity as a whole. Remarkable.    M- Somewhat creamy and quite viscous with a bit of a tingle from the hops and medium carbonation. Fullish body.    O- Though I feel like this beer is better realized and a bit smoother on draft, the bottled version certainly does it justice. An unforgiving Black IPA that is the prototype for all other Black IPAs.

Poured from a bottle into a snifter at around 45°F    Appearance (4.25): Black with a two finger tan head    Smell (4.25): pine and fruity hops prominent with undertones of caramel and roasted malts    Taste (4.25): Hops upfront that fades into slight roasted malts    Mouthfeel(4.25): Silky medium body with substantial bitterness    Overall (4.25): Id rather have an IPA or a stout, but as far as Black IPAs go, this has to be one of the benchmarks. My favorite in the style so far. One part hops and one part roasted malts. Good stuff!

A: Dark, black oil color. Thick, light khaki head. Crystally lacing    S: Very earthy, wood, slight fruit hops and slight grassiness. I actually smell a little toasted marshmallow as I keep drinking it.    T: Very mellow, subdued and earthy. Smooth and not has heavy as you would expect. Just a faint bitterness to let you know that the hops are there.     M: Not thick, not light, just right. Little carbonation with chalky finish    O: Awesome, awesome beer. Black IPAs are always a hit or miss for me and this is right on. Would definitely drink again and it's probably my favorite bottled Stone Brewery beer.     Update: Just tried this beer with steak, blue cheese and soy sauce and it tasted amazing. This beer goes perfect with really savory food.

Appearance: An opaque, ebony brew with a smooth tan head that melts quickly due to the high alcohol content, but still leaves lacing on the glass. 2/3    Aroma: Refreshing C-hops mix surprisingly well with roasty coffee notes from the malt. Some tropical fruit aromas add additional brightness and complexity. 12/12    Taste: Roasted, almost smoky malt leads to well brewed coffee flavors that mix nicely with a heavy sigh of citrus, earth, and pine. Almost reminiscent of a rauchbier, as the smoky flavors give way to some uniquely savory tastes. 19/20    Mouthfeel: Medium body leads the way to a dry finish, thanks to a medium dose of carbonation. Slight chewiness brings additional depth to the flavor, while typical IPA bitterness reminds us that the beer is ultimately "true to style." 5/5    Overall: A unique, delicious, well-crafted IPA that balances black smokiness with bright hops. There definitely exists the notion that by calling upon unquestionable expertise, this beer achieves the nearly unthinkable. Absolutely incredible. 9/10    TOTAL: 47/50   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Black IPAs are one of my favorite beer creations. The creativity of balancing roasted malty goodness and hops that complement these flavor produces amazing beers. Stone's Black IPA is a great example of a complex amazing beer. The taste is well balanced of malt sweetness and hop bitterness with an acidic middle taste of mild balsamic vinegar.

A - About 2 fingers of light khaki head. Great lacing and retention. Deep black body.    S - Floral hops and sweet malt with a touch of orange.     T - Floral hops, roasted malt, more floral hops and sweet orange. Very little bitterness.    M - Full bodied with medium-low carbonation. Easy drinking for the high abv.    O - I expected a lot more roasted malt and bitterness considering the style, but it was a great beer nonetheless. I'm thinking that the bottle I had was past its prime as far as intense hoppiness, but for some reason a lot of great hop flavors stuck around. Flavor profile reminded me of Terry's Chocolate Orange.

So I had this (7 years old) side by side with Stone's 10th Anniversary (8 years old). Not bad, practically a barleywine-but I'm just gonna come out and say it. It could have used another year of age.    Tasted like a cross between a barleywine and an IPA, and, at this point, I would have preferred if it just went full IPA.    Muddy, brown color. Not flat, astonishingly.   
Pours black with some deep amber highlights. One inch head that clings to the glass quite well. Definite hop presence in the aroma, slight citrus, and roasted coffee. Taste has a pretty strong vanilla component blending nicely with pine and citrus hop. Great black IPA, its nice to see this style picking up some momentum!   
dcerdman 
very tasty. Hoppy front with strong backbone. Great Balance. No overt alcohol taste even tho it's 8.70 ABV. Came in a very reasonably priced variety case way here on the east coast. Happy with this one   
Really enjoyable black IPA. Sets the bar high for others.

I am not an IPA fan by nature - I gravitate towards the 'Dark Side.' This is the Skywalker of IPAs. Bringing the malty darkness akin to a Sith Lord with the tremendous zest of a good Jedi IPA... OK - done with the StarWars analogies. A very good IPA for us stout fans.

First BA review in a few years! Dark ruby when held to the light with big sheets of thick lacing. Great aromas from this one, malty and dark roasted notes, slightly sweet and subtle vanilla. Soft on the pallet with a nice hop texture, finishing with a lasting dryness till the next sip. Very balanced BIPA, lending itself to the the hoppy side of the range. The strong ABV is controlled and not overpowering, but shows on the finish. I really like this offering from Stone and see it as one to judge others.

Stone Brewing Co.  Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA  “Enjoy By” date of 10/20/2014 printed on bottle  Date Reviewed: September 7th, 2014  Glass of Choice: IPA Glass  12 fluid ounce bottle    Eyes: A dense tan head collapsed and left a good amount of sticky lacing. Dark brown body… coffee coloured would best describe this body as it had a translucent brown glow around the edges of the glass.     Nose: The hops hit the nose hard: primarily floral with minor herbal traces. Very subtle presence of toasted malts… subtle may be too generous of a description here.     Taste: An explosion of floral and herbal hop flavours hit the tongue right off the bat. A weak backbone of toasted grains and coffee made up the malts. The brewers over at Stone nailed the balance here… just the right amount of warm, toasty malts to showcase a very fresh and heavy hop flavour. Medium-bodied. Moderate-heavy carbonation.    Overall: Excellent black IPA. A real treat for hop-heads.

The appearance was nice being very dark brown and a tan head that lasts a bit. The smell is full of hops but not much else it would seem. The taste though was very different. Starting out with a lot of floral notes in the beginning gave way to a semi sweet malt finish that I found very refreshing. Would highly recommend.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Amazing, must try beer. Best black IPA ever.     A: The head capped the beer and lasted for an hour as I let it come to cellar temp.  Bold, black body, creamy thick head like a stout.     S: Hops forward, but crazy original salt & sweet malts in the background. Prominent pine, charcoal, summer hay, herbs.     T: Earthier, but follows the smell profile. Deeply complex. Kind of like a strong ale or Belgian in the sweet malt backbone, but with more charcoal and chalk.     MF: Good body, then chalk-like crispness, dry finish.    Amazing beer, starts more amazing than it finishes. Compares well with Arrogant Bastard, which stands as an all-time fave.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 12oz bottle from Stone variety pack, poured into pint glass. Enjoy by 10/02/14.     Black body with reddish hints when held up against a light. Small tan colored head, well carbonated, and good lacing.     Faint sweetness on the nose.    Taste was very nice, sweet with only a very faint bitterness. Roasted malts come out at the end. (Similar pattern to Arrogant Bastard) Mouth was around medium.     I personally do not really understand Black Ales/IPA's, seems to me there are always much better options on either the IPA or stout side. This one seems to favor the stout side. Taste seem to improve as the ale warmed up toward room temperature. Overall, an enjoyable drink.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 This has to be the best black IPA on the planet. Great dark appearance! The smell of roasted malts is phenomenal. Characteristically over hopped like many Stone beers but the Taste is a perfect blend of malt and hops. This could be my favorite Stone beer, and they have a lot of great ones!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Purchased a variety pack in Bridgeville, PA.    Pours very dark, but not pitch black. The lightest beer that is called "black" I've ever seen.    First smell is of your everyday ipa. Nothing out of the ordinary. Hoppy/Citrus, blah blah blah.    I have to be honest I am not very found of this beer. I like Stone Brewery, I guess my expectations were too high. Piney, grapefruit, but just too bitter for me.    Mouthfeel. I don't know, a little watery to me. Just not very fond of it. I taste no alcohol.    Overall, I wouldn't purchase this as a case or a 6 pack. It was fine for a variety pack. Too much bitter after taste, and not enough flavor and poor mouthfeel.
