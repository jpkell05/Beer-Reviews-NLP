The nose is woody, with rich roasted grains, vanilla and expresso. Sip a bit and enjoy layers of flavor come forward...complex wood and stone fruits come forward, followed with a touch of bitterness on the tongue. The hefty 12% ABV is absolutely hidden, so beware. We'd pair this with a grilled steak, in place of a barrel aged Zindfadel -- it's that good.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Well lets start with...I wish I would have rated this brew years ago when I first tried it, because the new brew for which I am rating now is a slight bit different. (still excellent, but not superb like before)  It pours a nice rich dark ebony with nice heavy tan foam...with very nice lacing.  As for the aroma seems to be a lil' on the sweet side, maybe like a cherry coke...with a hint of the wood aged coming thru.  The taste is what i think is a lil' different, but follows the nose...I remember it a tad bit smoother. It does still follow the nose... with a little more of the wood age coming through...and the cherry coke in the background, and the ABV is very well hidden. So I need to finish this review before it shows up!  The feel seems to be a lil' different as well...i remember it a bit smoother, but still very enjoyable by all means with the ABV being there.  Overall it is still a wonderful brew and will keep sampling...nudge, nudge, wink, wink don't cha know.

Back end is sweet smelling.  Tastes is vanilla, woody- though not it a bourbon sense, cherry and cola notes come through as well. Some boozy notes though they are mild.  Mouthfeel is thick, soft creamy carb.  This beer is a winner for me. Browns are not something I've sought out before but I'm making an effort to try more. The nose on this is very interesting and sets it apart from what I expected. This one doesn't disappoint.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A 12oz bottle of a 12% ABV beer after 12 months in my cellar. A DFH classic, unique and wonderful. Perfect traditional brown look, deep dark cherry and mahogany color, with a brief, pretty cafe au lait head. The rich fragrance hits the nose with a sweet medley of plum jam, chocolate, salty earthy tones and much more. Then the amazing flavor is Chapter 2, not so much adding to the aroma as following it with another burst of flavors, just as varied and entirely different. Char, cocoa and raisins predominant early, then give way to fresh brown bread and honey notes. The mouthfeel is incredible, like a dense liquid of compressed microbubbles that phase shift into carbonation on my tongue. A truly world class beer, even better after a year or two in my cellar!   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 From notes 9/16/12: Pours shoe polish black with 1./5 fingers of moderately lasting, fine bubbled foamy, mocha head that leaves little patches of thin lace. Aroma is caramel, toffee, woody vanilla, dark roast and burnt malt notes with some chocolate and coffee. Taste is extra rich malty caramel, toffee, molasses blended with fig, prune, woody vanilla, dark chocolate and coffee backed by a roasted, lightly burnt character; alcohol prominence in the latter half of the sip with a nice bite in the finish and bittersweet aftertaste. This is one flavor heavy, high gravity brew! Excellent as a late night warmer after a hard day. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low but adequate carbonation, thick and a little syrupy but smooth.

Smells sickeningly sweet and nutty definitely cloying although it doesn’t taste that way. Taste has some sweetness to it, I am getting the vanilla and caramel as described. Also some coffee. The abv is well hidden and I love it cuz I can get a buzz quickly off this. Mouthfeel is semi thick with lots of bubbly. Overall one of my fave brown ales to date.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Bottled on 09:19/16 1931. DFH Tulip!    A: pours a dark brown, bordering on black with a thin skim of head that rapidly dissipates to nothing more than an island in the center. Held up to a bright light nothing is coming through except at the very margins. Some tiny carb showing there at the edge, but nothing else.    S: sweet, syrupy, boozy nose. Caramel, molasses. Maybe my imagination, but I think I smell some wood. Really does smell like a mild, less roasty RIS.    T: arrives with an immediate, mouth filling sweetness. Complex fruit sugars: molasses, dried fig, prune, blood, tobacco, oak. Lingering licorice, vanilla, molasses, tobacco, and then oak. There is a bit of malt roast here, but it is very mild. Like a breakfast blend coffee. Alcohol is not present on the palate nearly as much as you would expect, but it appears toward the end and lingers on the finish. I bought this not knowing that it was nearly two years old. I wonder if this is one that is better fresh?    M: what do you think it feels like? Motor oil. Thick and syrupy, but with adequate carbonation. Fairly clean, but there is a lingering flavor, of not texture.    O: it’s damn near 100 degrees out today, but this has been sitting in my fridge for months, and I figured hey, it’s now or never. I’ve had RIS’s in hot weather before, and so that isn’t the source of my ambivalence. Really, it’s that this is overpoweringly sweet and boozy, and lacking in either hop or roast bitterness to balance it out. I find this true of many barrel-aged beers; perhaps I’m just not a fan of barrel aging beer (I love whisky, though). A definite sipper, best for the winter months and when you have nothing to do and nowhere to be. For me, a one and done. I wanted to have tried it, so I tried it. Glad I did, but I won’t be having it again.

My other 3 wont go to waste however!

Overall this beer is enjoyable and I will purchase again.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron Wood-aged Brown Ale, 12% ABV. Pours dark brown to black, with a one finger tan head. Nose is caramel, taste is caramel, quite sweet, almost no bitterness, but boozy. Decent mouthfeel, overall excellent. Boozier and tastier than most brown ales.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Poured from a single-serve into a tulip...    Pours a porter-stout-like opaque dark brown to black. A vigorous pour yielded a substantial tan foamy head. The head and lacing persist fairly well.     The nose is fairly malty and toasty, with expected wood notes. The booze is noticeable here.    The flavor is all over the map. Big chewy malts in the form of caramel and molasses immediately hit the palate, followed by a strong raw booze note. Earthy hop notes balance the malts fairly well, though this skews pretty sweet. Very barleywine-like or even old ale, with a barrel note that arrives in the aftertaste.    The mouthfeel is solid and well-matched. Definitely chewy and full-bodied, it nevertheless delivers just enough hop and booze to balance things out. And the carbonation is unexpected given the ABV.    This isn't a "brown" in the conventional sense at all. Very barleywine in many ways, although less hoppy than most iterations of that style. If the booze was a bit more hidden it would be a top-notcher. Still, a good brew.

Little bit of a bite to the 12% beer as it goes down with a sweet flavor like molasses that lingers in the back of the mouth. This is a pretty strong stout-like beer especially after aging. Completely overpowers the taste of this delicious shrimp queso flameado dish in a good way. A definite winner with props much deserved. Crazy that the shop has 2 year old 4 packs just sitting there. At a reasonable price too. Thanks again DF.

look: 3.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 L: I've never seen a brown that looked so much like a porter or possibly even a stout. It's very dark brown and just a bit of light adds some color to the body. The head is a smallish, thin one but tightly bubbled, leaving spotting on the glass behind a thin leg.  S: You can smell a bit of alcohol, but the barrel adds a lot of character. Good wood with some caramel and vanilla sweetness over a bit of light roast.  T:This one is balanced, not too sweet, and very tasty. The only thing that detracts is the strength of the raw sort of alcohol, and this might be the perfect brown ale without it. As such, it's excellent, with lots of complexity, bread and just enough of a leafy / earthy / almost nutty hops presence to counter the sweetness. Wood adds a nice dryness that doesn't take it overboard or go astringent.  F: This is one that could be very dry, and overly so, between the alcohol and wood but doesn't. It has a bit more body than the typical brown without being heavy and balances crispness and smoothness very nicely.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 I keep finding myself coming back to this beer time and again. Especially after my local Whole Foods in the Bay Area started carrying it.    The color is dark, maybe even dank, especially for a brown ale. It feels thick as it pours, and ends up with a nice, even layer of foam on the head.    The aroma comes across with caramel and toasted nuts (almonds, perhaps). Of course, those caramel-coated nuts are surrounded by the smell of the wood! Wonderfully deep and complex.    The taste is heavy and warm, filled with notes of caramel and molasses. The high ABV isn't something you notice on the way in, but after one, I'm always thinking why I don't do that more often.    Overall, it's absolutely worth and taste and something I think is worth coming back to.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours black with a finger and half of khaki foam with marvelous head retention. Aroma is toasted, nutted, breaded, and caramel malts with soothing oak. Flavor profile is toasted, roasted, nutted, breaded, and caramel malts. It has a wonderfully diverse quality to it, all the while, remaining balanced. Touches of caramel, oak, and molasses help smooth things out even further burying any sign of the 12% ABV. Mouth feel is velvety, smooth, and creamy with a medium thickness. Overall, a splendid beer that retains a world class balance. It drinks quite a bit like a stout, but a balanced stout at that. Lovely brew.     Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.

The head retention and lacing are incredible for an abv of 12%, so it looks magnificent.    It smells like an imperial stout, too. It smells like dark chocolate, baking cocoa, espresso, licorice, molasses, black pepper. Slightly butter, too, with hints of soy sauce. Smells delectable.    Huge dark and milk chocolate upfront with some caramel and toffee. Big creaminess with vanilla and almond notes. Spicy mid-palate notes of black pepper, licorice, star anise. Slightly smoky. Hints of prune and raisin. A little bit of soy sauce. Finishes slightly sweet but not cloying, alcohol extremely well-hidden, just a warmth going down.    The mouthfeel on this beer is world-class. So silky-smooth, soft, and velvety. Super creamy, but not thick, chewy, or heavy. Moderately carbonated. Flows quickly on the palate but doesn't want to leave your mouth, either. Finishes slightly sticky with some residual sweetness.    Wow! This beer blew my mind. I'm not sure what to expect from the Palo Santo wood, and it tastes more like an imperial stout than a brown ale, but wow, what a magnificent beer. This is absolutely stellar.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This might be the best DFH I've ever had...Damn is it tasty...    I knew there was something special about this beer when I read it was a brown ale but it poured out more like a liquid, black stout. It had thin foam, light lacing, but the impenetrable blackness of the beer was impressive. The scent was a pleasant blend of caramel, roasted notes, and the distinct booziness that comes with 12% ABV. Mouthfeel was full-bodied, somewhat creamy, and more carbonated than I prefer but not to the point of distraction. The taste was anything like a brown ale - this was more a flavorful stout if anything. Though the booziness was the strong note, there were background flavors of vanilla and caramel, with a touch of roasted malts to round it all up.     What an incredible and unexpected surprise from a brewer I thought I had already pegged. Nice job DFH...

Only reason I didn't make it perfect is because of it's dark stout body when ot is classified as a brown ale. However if this is a brown ale it's the best of the best.    Flavors of mocha vanilla, oak toffee, caramel that is not added to the beer but rather a result from the Palo santo wooden barrels it aged in. Dogfish Head's finest, a well done brew that ages so well after a year i put a couple away to see how it does with a couple more.   A great slow sipper that tastes best at cellar temp.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 As others wrote: "Finally good use of brown ale". Brown ale rocks when imperial.   My only fault with it is it's too sweet be a degree.   a) Lasting two finger mocha head on a black body which pours thick and laces in deep sheets.  s) faint compared with its massive flavor wave. Malts of caramel, toffee, earthy hops and charred and oiled wood.  t) Starts with a candy bar of vanilla, mocha and caramel. Then complex with wood, oiled wood, church incense, earthy hops, fall forest floor and finishing bitter in a nice clean up. Not too boozy.  f) It's thick, oily, a meditation beer with moderate carbonation and wine like tautness.   o) Up there with Foxtrot.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 This beer pours almost black with a true brown head that is about a finger-width thick.    The aroma is is oaky and a bit smokey... probably from the barrel. This has a really rich/complex character.    The initial taste is so complex...there is a hint of vanilla, it the Woodieness from the barrel aging produces a smokey taste right off the bat. In the middle, the beer has a good dose of Carmel and mal, and a hint of chocolate.. The beer finishes with a rich, smoky aftertaste that warms on the tongue.    The mouthfeel is full-bodied with perfect carbonation.    This is a really interesting brown ale. The complexity of this beer is amazing. It boarded on a swartzbier. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a full-bodied brown ale.

Smell: malts, chocolate and dark fruit make up a nice but subdued smell    Taste: nearly perfect, dark fruits and chocolate/maltiness assert themselves and vanilla makes an appearance as well. A unique woody taste faintly reminiscent of oak is also there.     Feel: smooth and creamy, medium carbonation     Overall: a smooth well balanced treat that hides it's alcohol like a champ, it's a rich, heavy brew. It is a bit higher priced but well worth trying!   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 A: Jet black, not much opacity. Short lived head.   S: Heavy on the wood and tannins up front. Then alcohol and char/smoke come through.   T: Good, but maybe not in as much vanilla and leather as I'd like. All of the flavors are well blended and smooth. Taste varies a lot over the course of drinking and it warming up. Faint candied fruits, raisin, vanilla bean.   M: Moderate carbonation, a little biting, and good alcohol warmth.  O: Definitely an unusual flavor, but maybe not if you are familiar with palo santo wood. I would drink it again for sure, but I'm on the fence if I would buy it or not. Maybe just a single bottle.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bottle into a glass.     I tried this early in my beer journey and couldn't finish it. Revisiting it now was a good move. It's big, bold, and complex, and a bit of an acquired taste. Among Bruce Banner brown ales, this is clearly The Hulk (if it even is a brown ale).    Look: dark cola black. Cloudy. Tan head dissipated to a thin ring. Minimal lacing.   Smell: a layered aroma. First, musty barn, wood, leather. Then, metallic, alcohol, char, and smoke. Last, dried fruits, raisin, vanilla bean, bourbon, and fig newtons.   Taste: unusual flavor, presumably from the palo santo wood. Very good, but possibly acquired. Taste follows the smell and is very complex, layered. Changes with the temperature.   Feel: low to moderate carbonation. Smooth. A little chewy. A lingering alcohol warmth.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours a dark brown almost black color with a light brown head about a half finger thick that lingers for quite some time. Smell is caramel, vanilla, fresh split wood, and leather. Taste is caramel, toffee, wood, and vanilla most notably, a little raisin also showing through. Caramel becomes stronger as the beer warms. Medium heavy body, low carbonation, smooth. Little bit of alcohol. It's certainly good. Not sure if I'd pay that price again ($15/4pack) but not disappointed either.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Looks like a deep black stout or porter.Smells like alcohol,raisins,old car leather smell, vanilla,chocolate,faint strawberry? Tastes deep,dank,almost fruity. I can tell the difference between the aging wood.Feels smooth, a tad bit slick maybe, sufficient carbonation. Not sure why this is not considered a port or stout. I guess because it is an American Brown Ale on steroids. Very tasty. Would have again. REVISION : Taste = After quite a few occasions of sampling this brew the Paulo Santo wood seems cloyingly sweet, strange super sweet malt profile. Too much of a good thing? I don't know. This is the first review I have changed opinion on.Would not buy again. The 1 in the fridge goes to the first person who wants a beer.

Aroma is not very strong, but has hints of wet wood and coffee. Some very light carafe.     Flavor is mostly blackberry coffee, then antiseptic, followed with wet wood, plum, and then a finish of vanilla and pepper. Flavor is pretty washed out over what I expected.     Feel is burning, carbonated, crisp, with a semi-dry finish.     Overall, a bit underwhelming, but I'm sure it will grow bigger with age. (It's good, just...the hype and price point...ya know)

A: Lots of vanilla, espresso, chocolate, roasted malts, not getting any of the wood on the nose, light touch of caramel, and it's pretty boozy.     T: Follows the nose with vanilla, espresso, chocolate, roasted malts, caramel, hit of spice from the wood, reminds me of turmeric, good amount of alcohol coming through. As the beer warms the caramel gains a stronger presence adding some sweetness. Also, the wood comes through as well adding a stronger spice note.    M: Full bodied with a dry finish, dry finish, low carbonation.     O: Lots of depth and complexity, especially as the beer warms, not a lot on the aroma, beer's strength is in its taste, solid mouthfeel, going to age the other bottles and see how much they change.

The head is short lived and light brown in color. Head recedes to a few islands of bubbles and a faint ring around the glass. Aroma is chocolate and roast malt with a hint of wood. Taste follows the nose with chocolate and roast up front yielding to woody, spicy boozy notes. Mouthfeel is full bodied, barely carbonated, soft yet sharp with boozy bitterness on the finish. It all works together quite well. Overall, very good. This is a rather extraordinary beer to just be able to look up a local store on the DFH website and purchase without trouble.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This beer pours a deep black with a smallish head.

The flavor starts with a strong note of chocolate, and then vanilla, licorice, toast, salami, pepperoni, and rye bread. The mouthfeel is quite thick with fairly minimal carbonation. Overall this is lovely and deep beer with innate complexity,

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Originally had this on tap at the World of Beer in Pensacola, Florida, been buying ever since. Bought 12 fl oz bottle from grocery store chilled for 48 hours and poured into snifter.    Look: Pours black with visible viscosity with one finger brown head that dissipates to lacing.    Smell: Nose is forward with sweet malts, dark chocolate, and a hint of coffee. Lingering notes of cut hardwood and molasses.     Taste: Follows the nose but heavier on the bourbon/vanilla notes from the wood. Lingering mildly bitter aftertaste of baker's chocolate and black coffee. Extremely well balanced and dangerously sippable for the 12% abv.    Body: Thick and syrupy but lightened considerably by the high carbonation. Mild coating left on tongue.     Overall: While I have never been disappointed by a Dogfish Head product, this is by far and away my favorite. Very rare too find a readily available brew that hits all the right notes like this one.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a deep dark brown with a small, light brown head. Smells like toasted malts, burnt brown sugar, and dark fruit. Can definitely sniff the booze too. Dates and brown sugar taste stand out the most, but lots of vanilla as well and can just make out the caramel, especially as it warms. Mouthfeel is smooth and lighter than I would expect for how long it takes me to finish off the glass. Overall it's a very good beer. I'm surprised by how fruity and yet rich/dark it is.     Had this on tap at the brewery and then in a 4-pack of bottles.

Tastes of deep rich caramel, roasted malt, currant, cacao, gum, herbal hops and wood, all taking their perfect positions on the stage. Smooth and goes down more like a 6 per-center. Complex and concerted.     Just when you think it's safe to forget the big guys, you find a beer like this and realize why they will always have their place at the table.

Perhaps it is impossible to make bad beer when it is aged in wood. My first Dogfish was a dark delight.

The appearance was basically a ruddy brown color with a nice one finger white foamy head that dissipates at a decent pace leaving some nice lacing. The smell was basically like a woody Brown Ale with some light vanilla and booze features. The taste was basically the same. On the palate, it sat about a medium on the body with a nice smooth slightly creaminess running about my mouth and tongue. Overall, I say this was a nicely done Strong Ale.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 I've recently been disappointed in a couple of Dogfish Head's offerings. This one does *not* disappoint.    This brown ale tastes and feels more like a barley wine to me - not a bad thing at all. DFH really seems to like adding hops to their beers - lots of hops. The hops are here too - but they do not overpower. Rather, they lend a welcome balance to the malt.    With a butt-kicking 12% ABV, this is a definite sipper, and probably more appropriate for warming a person up on a chilly autumn or winter evening rather than here in June. But I love dark, rich, flavorful beers all year around.    Chocolate notes are apparent in the flavor, and a bit less so in the aroma. The mouthfeel is wonderfully creamy, and the carbonation is just enough to tickle the throat.    A delicious beer that, though quite expensive, is one I will surely buy again.

Okay, so it's been a while since I've reviewed anything, as I am a busy man and don't necessarily care to much for a review after a long dat at work, so here I am, reviewing a vintage of one of my favorite beers. Palo Santo (means "holy tree") Marron is a delicious, rich but subtle brown ale aged on Palo Santo wood, which is used in many South American wines. Pouring a deep midnight black, with a subtle light brown head of about a pinky's width, this beer unleashes aromas of wood, vanilla, dark fruit and chocolate, which evolve into a mix that is not only subtle, but wonderful as well.    The taste follows suit, with rich flavors of chocolate, vanilla, wood and dark fruit, but in a much more stated amount than the aroma would have you believe. As it warms, the wood becomes much more prominent without overpowering the softer notes. A definite after work sipper, perfect with a beef stew or smoked cheese.    For a two year vintage, this beer has held up incredibly well. I'm always happy to see such beer aging on shelves, more for me and those who enjoy aged ales. If you see this vintage around, pick it up, sit back, relax and enjoy.

It is rich in mouthfeel - smooth, soft, rich, mildly carbonated, almost syrupy, but not. Taste is rich, and complex - hints of vanilla, licorice, nuts. Phenomenal beer with food! Steak or, at Dogfish's restaurant, the Gorgonzola burger!

Taste - Loads of chocolate, caramel, malt is creamy and mellow, vanilla towards the middle, almond-like bitterness, alcohol is gentle, light coffee towards the end. Just enough bitterness to offset the sweetness. Aftertaste is long with lingering toast and coffee.  Feel - Full bodied, creamy, mild alcohol warmth, slightly oily.     Overall - A real treat to drink, loads of flavor and complexity that only improves as it warms. One of my all time favorites.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Bottle dated october of 2015, so theres a year and a half of age on it.    Beer pours inky black with tan head,   looks more like a stout than a brown. Light lacing    Smells like coffee and maybe light tobacco.    Flavor is what i would call wood aged imperial porter(or stout). Most brown ales dont touch the abv or darkness this beer has. Very enjoyable to me as I love high abv dark beers in general.    Mouthfeel isnt thin, but surprisingly drinkable for a high octane brown. I could see drinking more than one if offered the opportunity.     Next time I buy these, I'll get one 4 pack to drink and one to age. It's that good. If you like high powered stouts, give this a try (even though it's labeled as a brown) At least try a single, dogfish head don't mess around.

look: 3.75 | smell: 2.25 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.5 **  04/13/17    Bottle to snifter.    I had this 6-7 years ago before I started recording most of my ratings, but I remember thinking it had an odd taste and I did not like it. Trying it this time, I think it's not as off-putting as before, but I still don't love it. I appreciate the strength and also the experimentation with the Brown Ale style which I like. Glad I tried it again    LOOK: very dark brown (almost black). Medium head fades quickly into some minor lacing.  AROMA: the wood dominates, maybe some vinegar or strange oils. Some roasted malt.  TASTE: a touch of raisin comes through, but otherwise it is the wood and strong oily taste which I can only imagine comes from the Palo Santo wood.  FEEL: Medium to Full bodied. Light carbonation due to thickness. Smooth mouthfeel, but some astringency from the wood characteristics.      **  12/13/18    Bottle to sniffer.    Giving this another shot. Mostly because I want to see what some age will do. This bottle is the 1st of a 4pack, bottled 10/24/18.    I agree with my notes from above, but maybe I was a bit harsh on the numbers.      this is a pretty good beer that is , at this point in its life, a little rough around the edges and unrefined. Hoping age will mellow it. The 12% should allow quality aging.  **

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 This beer brings the flavor, with the barrel aging setting it apart from most browns I have had. Honestly, it tastes closer to an imperial IMO. Gaudy flavor for a brown, closer to stouts, which may be good depending on what you are looking for.    Color, smell are standard for a brown; good. It is a great beer for your 3rd of the night; you can still taste it, strong, memorable.

Look: dark, thick, syrupy in appearance  smell: great aroma of malt and carmel  taste: reminds me of the goose island bourbon county stout. complex tastes, a little chocolate a little vanilla  feel: thick, big body, boozy beer. I'd get it again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours like a imp stout...near black with short but thick and creamy brown head with good retention and lace. Nose is sweet roasted malt, a bit like brown bread and some woody notes. Taste is on the sweet side like a barleywine. Not overly boozy for 12%, although I've had this mellowing in the cellar for a year. Vanilla, chewy raisin, and again a light woody note. Overall, a good beer, but I was hoping for a bit more complexity rather than just going big on the malt and ABV. I'd certainly call this a barleywine and not a brown ale.

Smells caramel malts, light coffee, light vanilla, brown sugar and light alcohol.    Taste is sweet caramel malts, light vanilla and coffee. Hints of dark fruit. Semi sweet finish fades to a lightly bitter lingering dark fruit   
look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 1/25/17....pours deep dark brown, fast tan foam that settles out. Woodsy red wine nose, backed by a roasted stout aroma. Rich thick stout taste, with a whisky like complexity. Vanilla cinnamon throughout, and with a chewy oaked flavor. Quite potent and unique. And technically a Brown Ale at that!

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Look:  Wow! Very dark and solid / opaque black. 1-finger head that was very dark tan/brown. The head flattens quickly. There is a small foam ring that is left. Pretty thick beer.    Smell:  Rich and malty. Caramel, chocolate, coffee, and some earthiness (wood).    Taste:  Heavy hitter. Huge flavors of chocolate and coffee. Very rich caramel... like an extra thick Porter. Some spiciness (possibly Rye?). Hints of vanilla and bourbon. The bitterness upfront is surprising. Some from hops, and some probably from the dark roasted grains. Very complex!! and woody beer. Hight ABV - decent alcohol burn. Different flavors with every sip.    Feel:  Very thick and full bodied.    Overall:  Amazing beer. Can't imagine the flavor being better for this one. Lacking some carbonation maybe. So complex and it only got better as it warmed and got closer to room temperature.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Description: Deep brown color with very little head or lacing. Almost looks like a brown stout. Smell is a big hit of wood...which I guess is palo santo wood? Spicy, cinnamon, caramel aroma follows. Taste is similar with caramel, wood, vanilla and smoky/woody finish. For a beer with this high of an ABV, the alcohol isn't very noticeable. There's a spice element on the taste as well with a little bit of heat. Moutfeel is think and velvety. Very smooth and stout like.    Suggested food pairing: Enchiladas with mole sauce    If you like this beer then you should also try: Founders Imperial Stout    Overall: 4.25 (This beer is good and I would likely have it again) When I hear "brown ale" I usually envision an unhopped, boring, uninspired beer. This was anything but. Full of flavor and flavors that you don't find too often. It really reminded me more of a stout than a brown ale. This beer is a good representation of pushing boundaries without going crazy or overdoing it. A pleasant surprise all around.

Ithe has a little bit of a nonbeer bite like liquor that I am not a fan of, but it is still a nice beer, one bottle would be my limit for a night. Probably because it's 12% that's a good thing. I think it would be great with a cigar.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a bottle dated 8/5/16 into a tall snifter glass. Forms a thick brown head that lingers for a few minutes. Color is dark brown to black. Not completely opaque, but close. Aroma is rich malt sweetness and distinctive wood notes. It's not oak (obviously), but it's difficult to describe the difference. Less tree sap aroma more sweetness maybe; closer to applewood. I do not detect anything I would attribute to hops.    The flavor is rich and smooth. Light roast and dark wood without significant bitterness. Reminds me of a rich mole sauce, minus any heat spiciness. I had expected some sweetness based on the malt and wood aromas, but this is dry. Not bone dry, but drier than other high ABV brown ales I've had. And drier than many of Dogfish's other big beers. Mouthfeel is great. It coats the mouth and tickles the tongue, and it lingers a bit, but not more than I'd want it to.     Overall, I'm not sure I'd call this a brown ale, but I definitely call it a great ale. It does unique things, and it does them well. I don't get to pick this up often, but when I do I kick myself for not buying more. Highly recommended.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 On tap in Greenville, SC.   Opaque dark brown body with a decent beige head.  A generous amount of dark roasted grains helps this achieve partially hidden alcohol.  Alcohol is obvious, but not quite harsh, in the feel, and the flavor is more than a touch boozy: just enough to hur my ratings on both dimensions.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I heard this beer can be hot so I let it sit 1 year.  A - Pours black with a thin head that disappears quickly and leaves a thin ring.  S - Aroma is coffee and vanilla.  T - Flavor is oak, vanilla, a little coffee. A very woody flavor.   M - More carbonation than I expected for this big beer. A little sticky.  O - The more I drink the more I like. Definitely a sipper, and a very enjoyable beer.

At this point, I thought all my DFH jokes were blowing up in my face, this is a nice beer to start out thus far.     The taste though hits like a shot of cheap whiskey. Hot. Like that water sealant you use on your wooden deck. Just really the alcohol cuts through this one hot and heavy, the viscosity of the beer doesn't seem to be enough to hold up. I like the aroma and what it shows you can do with barrel aging, but beyond that its a rough one.

If you love a rich, dark and heavy brew with tons of flavor then this is one of them for sure .  Poured into a chilled snifter with a nice foamy head .   As it warms it's just as tasty as when chilled . At 12% alcohol content it's one of the strongest available and at a reasonable price .   Highly recommended to those who love dark and flavorful brew :)

This beer is very, very good.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 L: Dark, very dark in fact. Thin white head, decent lacing.    S: Smells phenomenal. Deep woody caramel sweetness with a hint of booziness. Almost characteristic of a light roasted coffee bean. (And i'm usually not the kind of guy that cares about or ever notices smells in a beer, so this is saying something I suppose.)     T: Lots of complexity here. Deffinitely a forward biting chocolate malt flavor, but the first thing you taste really is what I would imagine aged wood would taste like, very similar to how I described the smell. Earthy, deffinitely boozey, and very malt-forward though there is a good amount of bitterness.     F: Thick, rich, and creamy. Plenty of carbonation despite the thin look of the head on the pour.     O: If you like malt-forward dark beer that is boozy and off-character or unique, grab yourself a couple of these and go to town! These guys are deffinitely sipping beers, and the flavor profiles more bordered along the lines of a smooth scotch in complexity. Honestly, brown ales are not my favorite, but I still really enjoyed this beer for the novelty and it really is quite smooth despite the crazy high ABV.

If I could change one thing in the taste profile I'd tone down the sweetness. But this is a complex and carefully crafted beer. Chocolate and caramel malts come through big time. Quite boozy for a beer. Though rated at 50 IBUs, did not impress me as being especially hoppy.

This is the first of a half case I got for Father's Day :) I'm going to cellar a few and see what I think a year or two from now.  12/23/16: Cellared 6 months. Alcohol has dropped into the background. Finish is sooth and definitely not bitter. Still smooth and easy to drink. Highly recommended.

This FINE ale pours a deep blackish brown with a nice head of light tan foam that settles to a thick ring, thin layer, and excellent lacing. Nose of vanilla, creme brule, toffee, subtle cocoa, and strong booze. Flavors exceed the nose with toffee and butterscotch on the front and sides, wooded notes from the barrel hit middle of the taste with cocoa and creme brule taking over the rear of the taste with notes of fresh brewed strong coffee. Excellent mouth feel, warming, full, and boozy with a chocolatey, barrel touched, booze characteristic. Excellent!    Cheers    Thanks to a friend from work for this one which I have had in a growler in the past but not recently. EXTRA enjoyable! Thanks Randy!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottled 6/3/15, drank today, 6/4/15.  Look: pitch black. no light coming through the beer.  Smell: Chocolate, toffee, vanilla, alcohol.  Taste: Chocolatey, more toffee. A slight coffee like bitterness. Definitely some alcohol, but that comes with the territory; more of a warming alcohol than a harsh alcohol.  Feel: Creamy mouthfeel.   Overall: A stellar beer in my opinion. Definitely a sipper. I would love to see how it changes with another year of aging. Pick up a 4 pack, drink one now and put the others away; visit them every year or so. I'd bet patience will continue to reward you.

This was my favorite new beer in 2015 and interested to see what 18 months does to it. Pours dark brown cola color, almost black. Little head but a thin ring of small caramel colored bubbles form around the edge of the glass. Smell of toffee dominates the nose for me and I'm not picking up much else. I get more in the taste, with notes of toffee, roasted malts and burnt coffee bitterness. Start to pick up vanilla as the beer warms. Syrupy mouthfeel that coats the mouth in a pleasant way. Medium carbonation. Alcohol has mellowed out in the cellar but it creeps up on you as you get to the bottom of the glass. Overall - love this beer.

Taste follows the nose, with that maple syrup style sweetness being followed by a bourbon type alcohol kick in the middle, finishing off with those woody and coffee notes. Medium body and carbonation, slightly thick and syrupy in the best way. Excellent flavor for people who love their beers strong, and this would probably age very well for those who can't quite handle the alcohol bite.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 I love this beer! It is darker than you'd expect a brown to be. Good head to start but then settles into a nice ring of foam. Smell is richer than a typical brown ale with hints of vanilla. The flavor imparted by the Palo Santo wood is quite nice - different from other barrel flavors but in a good way. Thick feeling in the mouth. Overall one a great beer and one of my favorites!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Look (4.25): Not what I expect from the label saying it's a "brown ale". Pours a dark brown color that makes you think porter or stout. Thick brown creamy head.    Smell (4): Chocolate, toasted malt, vanilla wood and a whole bunch of booze. Reminds me of burnt wood and smores. Campfires basically.    Taste (4.5): Is it possible to taste smoke? There also the chocolate and boozey flavors with are definitely at large. This a very big and complex brew. I love it.    Mouthfeel (4): Rich, thick and creamy. I love it. Definitely full bodied with a long smokey aftertaste. Dry and some spice at the end of the palate.    Overall (4.25): An incredibly intense beer. Cheers to Dogfish Head for always finding a way to make me fall in love with their brews!

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 From a 355 ml bottle (no date, but I have been sitting on this bottle for at least two years) into a tulip. Reviewed from notes dated April 16, 2016.    A-The beer is very dark for a brown ale; it looks more like a stout. The pour is heavy and oily coming out of the bottle. A short, tan head fades quickly.     S-The aroma is a very enticing mixture of milk and dark chocolate, dark caramel, a little bit of sour cherry, and this unique herbal, cedar-like woody smell. I'm not sure how it works, but I'm really intrigued. A little alcohol heat is noticeable too.    T-The taste opens with a little wave of fruity sweetness; I think cherries and plum. Then an earthy wave of chocolatey malts kicks in. I taste carob, vanilla, and milk and dark chocolates. The finish dries out a bit with that same intriguing oaky/cedar-like note. Complex and layered. The beer is 12% ABV, and you can taste the alcohol, but the alcohol is integrated well.    M-The body is thick and robust on the palate with a fine persistent carbonation. Like a stout more than a brown.    O-Wow. This beer was a pleasant surprise: complex, unique, and tasty. I know that DFH makes some classic high-ABV beers that have fallen out of favor in recent years, but this beer can keep up with anything the new kids are putting out. I will definitely buy another bottle or two for cellaring when I see it again.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Just an interesting beer I've been meaning to review for a while. Pours a muddy near black color with a cap of dark tan head and no lace. Nose is complex and a little different with each sniff; dark fruit, smoked meat, oak, vanilla, fresh cream, and the whole thing reminds me distantly of Grand Marnier.    Never thought that 50 IBUs could hide so effortlessly. The malt is overpowering, tinged with wood and plum notes. The alcohol is present but not kicking as high as you'd think for a beast of this size. Texture is firm and low in carbonation, which works pretty well. Aftertaste is surprisingly mellow and balanced.     I couldn't see more than one, most likely as a nightcap. Also, to me this is much more in line with an Old Ale than a Brown, but nobody asked me. A really well crafted beer for the initiated. One of my favorite from DFH.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Pours a deep brown with moderate head. Lots of deep oak and roasted malt on the aroma. Like a lot of Dogfish beers there is a noticeable astringent alchohol flavor, but for the most part it is covered up by the dark malt notes (bitter chocolate, a little coffee) and the oak.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Besides "How does Dogfish do that?", three questions define this brew for me.    First, how can 50 IBU taste sweet ? (Probable answer: with a craftily roasted malt bill.)    Second, why do stouts aged in bourbon barrels taste first like vanilla and then ale; yet this brown ale tastes like it should. (Probably answer: Palo Santo doesn't take the easy route to popular Taste and limits its barrel-aging.)     Third, How does Dogfish Head take improbable sounding beers and, reasonably consistently, produce thoughtful and interesting beers ? (Probable answer that also is a cop-out: they are brewing geniuses !)    Much more can be said about this interesting, wonderful brew. But its name says enough: this mystical brew comes from some "holy tree." Sit under it and enjoy. Transcendently smooth.

Some good lacing.    Smell- Chocolate and vanilla aromas with carmelized sugar.    Taste- Sweet molasses with a distinct woody flavor. Smoky wood, and chocolate round out the middle of the flavors. Becomes dryer, yet still sweet with notes of chocolate. Finishes with mild coffee flavor and leaves the palate with prominent vanilla notes.    Mouthfeel- Heavy in body with low carbonation. Viscous. Boozy burn as well.    Overall- Some great complexity with this burly brown ale by DFH. Many flavors working together to create a fine sipper. The barrel aging is defintely noticeable in this beer and is what makes it unique. Worth the pricey 4 pack.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 one of my fav off centered Brown Ale (doubt if that title explains what kinda beast this is). Read this awesome article in New Yorker mag about this beer which lead me to craft brews.  http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/11/24/a-better-brew  Amazing history on Palo santo and the lengths Sam Calagione went through to make this. Hats off to DFH. Am aging a few bottles and will see what happens.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 APPEARANCE: Very dark brown, no light through it. Finger+ of creamy tan head that lingers awhile. No real lacing down the glass.  AROMA: Chocolate, sweet caramel. Lots of coffee, lots of dark dried fruits, slight smokiness, dark bread crust, leather, swirl the glass and the alcohol jumps out.  TASTE: Just like aroma. If I didn't know this was aged in wooden barrels, I doubt I would have guessed that.  FEEL: Lots like an RIS except more creamy, actually...frothy. Low carbonation, but just enough. Sticky.  OVERALL: Very complex, interesting beer. Big dark dried fruit, leathery, chocolate, coffee. Thumbs up! Sip this stuff.

A bit more of a gusher than I expected, with an aggressive pour yielding half a glass of thick, dense tan foam that left lots of attractive lacing as it settled to a thin ring. Best at just above cellar temperature, when the aromas and flavors seem to peak. This draws you in with warm, inviting notes of caramel, vanilla, chocolate, and black cherry. Quite sweet on the palate, with very low bitterness and no trace of char. There is some lingering sweetness on the finish, along with a touch of woody sourness. There is also a bit of alcohol warmth, but it is quite understated for such a big beer. Lip-smackingly delicious and well crafted. Proceed with caution!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 A - Very dark opaque brown pour with a very, very thick creamy mocha colored head. The creamy layer of head sticks to the sides of the glass like glue, viscous.    S - Wood, light smoky char, vanilla, toasted caramel malt, and cream.    T - Very boozy from start to finish and the very first nuance to pond your palate. Some smoky malt, toasted caramel toffee (but very subdued), wood character all the way through, vanilla, chocolate, a touch of mocha. Finishes with a very slight mocha bitterness but mostly sweet and boozy on the back end.    M - Although very boozy it never gets overly hot, just warm. Very creamy on the tongue,     O - Not a fan of Brown Ales by any means but really enjoyed this one - maybe because it pushes the boundaries and showcases the potential of a Brown Ale. Underrated. Definitely worth a try.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Outstanding beer that, when compared against the general American Brown Ale population (how it's categorized here at Beer Advocate), really stands in a league of its own. Pours almost black with a thick, sticky, mocha head that laces well. Smell is molasses, booze, dark fruits, a pleasant oak (or a darker wood?), and appealing vanilla. Taste is baker's chocolate, brown sugar, the perfect amount of oak and darker wood, caramel, and vanilla. Feel is thick, rich, and sticky. Alcohol is definitely there -- pleasant boozy burn -- but not in any way overwhelming. Again, comparing this beer to normal browns is just unfair. But it also stands out among more comparable wood-aged browns that end up over-oaked or lacking in congruity. This beer is fantastic.

Glad I finally got a chance to try this one but not one I would search out again; prefer a heavier mouthfeel on a beer that has this level of alcohol.

The head is thick, dark tan, dense and thick, in fact the beer even pours out thicker than most ales, which helps create the thick dense head. There’s a patch of small fluffy bubbles gathered in the middle, and all of this is rounded up by a nice dense lacing.  Smell: Caramel, apples, toffee, roasted malts, mild fig and grapes and dates. Mild spices can be detected.  Taste: heavy on the roasted malts and the alcohol is up front. As it hits the middle of your mouth, it gets a little nutty and the spices come out just a bit.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, creamy and it just envelopes your entire mouth with nice warming alcohol and finished just a bit dry.  Overall: This is the best brown ale I’ve had so far, if you see it you have to buy, don’t miss out!

It's one of the best smells I've experienced in a brown ale. It's absolutely delicious! Chocolate, caramel, and dark fruit. There is a strong alcohol burn; you really notice the 12% ABV. This ale drinks like a stout; it's thick, rich, and creamy. It's flavors blend very well. Overall, it is a very fine brown ale. It truly deserves its excellent reputation. I'll most definitely drink this one again!

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Viscous black with vibrant mahogany edges and a dense mocha head--if ever there was a Stout disguised as a Brown Ale, this is it.    Oh my god the aroma of this is just a trance inducing walk through the desert. Chocolate malt, vanilla, molasses and coffee are quickly overcome by the amazing effect the Palo Santo wood gives off--a fresh green yet anciently aged sort of cedar with a smoked salt and peppery bite.    Taste is nearly identical to the smell which has me bowing down to the Dogfish Head idol. Molasses and chocolate are very well accompanied by the amazingly delicious Palo Santo wood element--I just don't understand how this tastes so good.    This puppy is bigger, more substantial, bossier, heavier, and more killer than any Porter I've ever had, and puts to shame half of the beers out there that feign to call themselves Stouts--and Dogfish calls this a Brown. Soft and frothy with a slight dry woody grit that feels just right for the attributes this beer gives off.    This is mind blowingly delicious and unbelievably unique. Seriously, there is nothing else on the market anywhere close to capturing the cedary scent and flavor that this does, while still seeming like a consumable product.    One of the best beers around.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12 ounce bottle into a tulip glass. About 17 months in the bottle.    Pours near black, opaque, almost a two finger head of thick foam, with a good amount of foamy cling. Looks great. Smell begins with malt, chocolate, raisins, dates, a slight wine aroma, plums, some wood, a little burnt sugar. Smells pretty good, too. Taste also leads with light roast malt, less chocolate than the nose, caramel, raisins, figs, some wine, more wood than the nose. Light alcohol, a little bitterness on the back end. This is good stuff. Smooth, full bodied, well carbonated, a little creamy.    One hell of a beer. The Palo Santo wood adds a great, unique flavor. So much going on here with both the aroma and taste. This is one everyone should try, well worth a purchase.

It pours almost black and smells of must and wood. The tastes brings forward brown sugar, roasted coffee, dates, and vanilla beans. Truly a delish porter. I'll keep more of these around

Aroma is full of activity with brown sugar, molasses, alcohol, roasted dark malts, leather, raisins, figs, dry red wine, and something sharp and sweet comes out the more you keep your nose in it.    Big roasted flavor pairs with dark chocolate, raisins, alcohol, and acidic coffee. The moment I notice something smoked in the flavor, it quickly morphs into something tart and an onslaught of alcohol warmth takes over the party.    One tough-as-nails brown ale here! This is an intense beer. Not for the meek.

I get chocolate, hazelnut, roasted malt, burnt caramel, leather, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, raisin bread. Full, creamy mouth feel and nicely carbonated to make it feel lighter. On the taste, I get a bit of the booze, dark caramel malts, chocolate covered raisins, an earthy woodiness, smoked grains, rum, and some vanilla.

Also taste of the same dark roasted malts that the aroma provides with a slight bit of vanilla added to it.    An awesome beer and worth buying and having on hand.

S: In some respects it smells like a cross between a barleywine and an imperial stout. It’s roasty and very malty with hints of prunes, raisons, and coffee. Very rich, with some perceptible alcohol, and just a touch of woodyness. Really interesting, really complex, really different.    T: Very rich and malty upfront, with some roastiness, following the nose. A good deal of hop bitterness with a sweet and somewhat bitter finish. Also fairly woodsy with hints of raisons. Dark malts take dominance in this one.    F: A medium-full mouthfeel (a bit lighter than expected) and moderate-low carbonation. Some warmth from the alcohol, but still surprisingly tame for a 12% abv.     O: Such a cool beer! Complex, delicious, and frankly, different. A cross between a barleywine and imperial stout, this is a real nice sipper with nice woodsy, roasty, and malty character. Probably my favorite year-round DFH brew.

Dark brown to black body, no light shines through the glass at all except on the edges which shows a maroon color. Light khaki tan head.  Aromas of vanilla, cola and a slight charred wood.  Tastes fantastic. Vanilla, cherry, spice and some of that woodiness with a lot of fruitiness that I wasn't expectin.  Full mouth feel with that 12% alcohol hidden well.  Overall this is a well crafted beer with that wood aging adding quite a bit of spice and complex flavors to enjoy. Reminiscent of a barrel aged stout. Planning on picking up a few more and holding on to them to see what else may come out of some added aging.

Quite possible the heaviest beer I've ever had, almost to the point of being off-putting but not quite. I like it, but I'd only by this a bottle at a time.

Smell is warm and inviting. Molasses, vanilla, alcohol, almost reminiscent of dark rum.    Taste follows, molasses sweetness, dark fruit, vanilla, chocolate, warming, dry and pleasantly boozy finish.

Aroma is of chocolate covered raisins/figs and a hint of vanilla. Tastes like booze soaked fruits and dark caramel malt; slight wood and bitter chocolate roast. Tasty stuff, but still pretty much a sipper at over two and a half years. Have two more bottles with the same date, so I'll try one again here in a year or so.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip. Deep, dark coffee brown, almost black, completely opaque. Head is thin, chocolate-brown, and falls slowly to a film. Lacing is sparse.    Nose has prominent woody notes, vanilla, toasted malts, and alcohol, with smokey/spicy highlights. A very aromatic beer.    Flavors are very bold... big oak-like woody notes right up front from the aging in exotic Palo Santo wood vats. Beneath that there are deep roasted/bittersweet chocolate malt flavors, molasses, dark fruits and dried berries. Alcohol follows in, but not in an overbearing way. Finish is a lingering mix of spicy tones, almost like some red wines; smoke, blended with subtle earthy hops.     Mouthfeel is very rich, chewy, viscous and mouth-coating. The heaviness in texture combined with the high ABV (12%) places this one firmly into the category of a "sipper." The decent level of carbonation does give it just a touch of tingle on the palate.    A somewhat experimental beer from a company known for such things, this DFH offering was quite a discovery. It's classed as a brown ale here, though that's perhaps a bit misleading... think more along the lines of a Belgian Strong Dark or even an Imperial Stout and you're getting a better idea of what this is like. With the high ABV, this one should age well; I'm planning to put a few up for a while and see how it evolves. As it is, this is already a great beer for people looking for a big ale.

Dark chocolate, a little vanilla, boozy. Thick, viscous mouthfeel. Reminds me of a barleywine. Wow, what an "in your face" beer. There's a lot going on here, and in typical Dogfish Head fashion it makes no attempt to reign in any of it. The 12% abv is noticeable, but it works very well with all the other assertive flavors. An outstanding beer that defies classification, and one of my favorites in the Dogfish Head lineup. Highly recommended.

Thick, velvety mouthfeel; oily; and chewy; mostly sweet finish.    Eye-popping lusciousness imbued with mouthwatering chocolate sweetness makes this one incredible beer.

S: sweet smell some booze and vanilla scents     T: Dark fruit and boozy sweetness.     F: great mouthfeel slightly boozy but not excessive.     O:Excellent beer would buy over and over again

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottle into a tulip.    A: Pours what I'd call dense opaque black with 1"+ cocoa colored head that recedes pretty slowly. Retention & lacing are both quite nice.    S: First up is pure oaky sweetness. I notice that as it warms, more of baked fruit aroma takes over- fig, apricot, maybe red raspberry. The booze is masked well.    T: Cocoa up front with a bit of a coffee touch. Mid palate reads as more candied fruit, black cherry, red raspberry. The finish is slightly more bitter with a much more pronounced oak character. It lingers heavy, but in a pleasant way.    M: Fairly moderate carb. The body is ever-so-slightly silky stickiness & overall creamy character. It drinks fairly heavy, which I'd say is fitting.    O: This is a very well done, truly unique ale. Throw out everything you know about Brown Ales with this one, yet at the same time, it's undeniably a Brown Ale. I love that about this brew.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Scant head. A little on the heavy side. Malty, sweet. In some respects similar to strong dark Belgian ale, in others similar to a porter or a stout. Not very balanced, too malty and cloying. Syrupy.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. 10/4/2011 date means this is approaching four years of age.     A: In the glass it sits the darkest shade of brown. Creamy brown head initially sits at a half inch, but settles shortly. It can be revived by swirling the glass. Spotty lacing.    S: Rich aromas of sticky blackstrap molasses and dark rum. Hazelnut fudge. Carob. Dark chewy caramel and vanilla extract. Very sweet. Some wet paper bag reveals the age. Woody. Fig and flashes of prune.    T: Lots of nutty and carob flavors. Dark rum. Big pull of spicy alcohol lets you know this beer means business and also helps to balance the deep sweetness. Dark caramel and brown sugar. Hints of fig and prune. Traces of earthy hops. Wood and woody vanilla rides up middle to end and brings a lot of welcome dryness. Trailing woody and carob finish.    M: Big, thick body. Very chewy and coating, yet velvety and sultry. Low tingling carbonation. Big alcohol warmth. Faded tannins.    O: Very impressive. Age suits this beer well. It's a gargantuan brew, but balanced perfectly. Pair with a hearty pot roast or a variety of savory beef dishes, then take a nap.

look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 | overall: 4 Pours pitch black with a tan coloured head. The head retains extremely well considering the abv.    The smell is sweet malts,some nuts and wood.    The taste is very sweet, nutty, woody,a lot alcohol with some hop bitterness .    The mouthfeel is thick, smooth and creamy.    Overall a big beer, would be good for dessert. Doesn't try and hide the alcohol.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a snifter.    A - Pours a deep, dark brown, thin cinnamon head.    S - Toasted almonds, peat smoke, figs, charred wood.    T - Extremely complex toasty nut and chocolate notes come out the gate. Roasty, nutty malts are quickly overcome by a huge charred wood flavor. Very rich vanilla bean notes and toasty, dry wood tannins interact with the robust malts beautifully. Tinges of chocolate malt weave in and out, but the Palo Santo wood is at the forefront. A light alcoholic burn develops over the mid-palate, climbing a bit in intensity with the chocolate malts towards the back. Finish is woody, sweet, a bit chocolatey, still bits of toasted almond, and decently boozy.    M - Absolutely nailed the mouthfeel. Full-bodied and sweet without being syrupy or cloying. Just enough carbonation to liven the flavor.    O - What a distinctive beer. Nothing tastes quite like it, and proudly eludes any style distinction. Even "barrel-aged imperial brown ale" is fitting a square peg in a round hole. Amazing.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Picked up a single from TW Arrowhead in early May for $3.99. Bottled on 2-4-15. First of a 2 part tasting. Part 2 is a 2008 version.    Beer poured dark brown with a beautiful tan head that has some serious hang time.    Nose is roasted malts and hints of sweet wood.    Taste is heavy roast and wood with an initial alcohol warming. Molasses and vanilla round things out with a decent amount of hopping so that it is not cloying.    Mouthfeel is full and very smooth.    Overall a solid brew...looking forward to the 2008 version!    The 2008 version was a little more raisony and less hoppy which led to a slightly smoother beer but not enough of an appreciation so the ratings will not be changed. Cheers!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 From a bottle into a snifter    Pour is deep brown with 2 fingers of thick kaki head. Minimal lace on the glass as head fades. Middle of the road on carbonation.     Smell molasses and vanilla. Milk chocolate and vanilla with faint roasted malts in the background.     Taste follows smell well. Fantastic vanilla and molasses. Malts are faint and I get some fruit with it. Really complex. There are tons of subtle flavors and each sip seems to bring more in the nose and on the toung. Maybe the best brown ale I've ever had     Feel is also strong. Flavors coat the palate well and last until the next sip.     Overall this is a fantastic beer. Best brown I've ever had! I would expect nothing less from dogfish.

Background whiff of chocolate was also present.   The taste was mostly molasses, followed by a cardboard aftertaste that I'll attribute to the barrel aging.   Heavy mouth feel. Somewhat syrupy, bitter finish.   Meh! Nothing to write home about. Good but not great. This tasted more like a porter than a brown ale. Too heavy IMO.

Licorice, dark fruits, oak, vanilla, toffee, and a bit of alcohol. Smells terrific.    Really friggin good. Roastiness up front. Lots of woody characteristics are omnipresent in this one. Slight Belgian style fruitiness ending with a very small burn from the alcohol. Really nice.     Surprisingly full bodied for the ABV. Slick and viscous mouthfeel which coats the mouth. Aftertaste of dark fruits and alcohol.    A tremendous offering from DFH. I usually overlook this one because it's so widely available but I think I'll pick this up much more often.

Easily one of the best beers I have encountered to date.

The head lasts a while and when it breaks it leaves lovely wisps of foam and some nice lacing. The smell is dark fruits and some wood. Flavor is woody with dark malts, some of the fruits from the nose. The feel is medium body with a creaminess present. Carbonation is medium. Booze is definitely present.     I've got to say, this is a damn fine beer. It's a real sipper though with the 12% ABV.

S: Anise, roasted malts, dark fruits.    T: Smokey malts, vanilla. So smooth and caramel sweet. Lots of complex wood effects from the barrels. The alcohol comes in late and kicks ass. Sip slowly.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Palo Santo Marron brewed by Dogfish Head Brewery, with an ABV of 12.00% This brew pours out a dark brown color, with a nice light brown head. The brew has the look of cola, not saying that is a bad thing. The smell is rich with flavor and sweetness. You also pick up on grain, malts, and a hit of hops in this brew. Now for the taste it is bold with flavor, and sweetness. There is a lot going on in Palo Santo Marron. At first, there is a bold sweetness and it fads to a clean roasted grains after taste. The mouthfeel is full bodied and well balance, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. I like how this brew is different from most brews on the market. Overall I giving Palo Santo Marron a 4.75 out 5. I would buy this brew again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours seal brown right out of the bottle, with nothing more than a ring of khaki froth around the surface. If I had a nickel for every brown ale that had such a deep, dark brown color...I’d be broke. This looks straight up nice. Aroma smells of salted caramel and peat, with hints of cherry and booze. Spotty lacing clings to the glass as the beer recedes.    Alcohol wastes no time asserting itself on the front end, but once it subsides, your tastebuds are treated to flavors of smooth, rich molasses accented by butterscotch, brown sugar, and vanilla. It doesn’t take long before your lips are ensconced in a sticky, malty, residue that could nearly glue your mouth shut. Earthy, herbal hops provide a subtle, bitter counterpoint without getting in the way of the malt. While the alcohol felt a little strident at first, some habituation reveals that it’s not nearly as pronounced as you’d expect for its ABV. The delicious aftertaste is a lingering haze of molasses and brown sugar. A hefty body provides plenty of substrate for the luxurious taste, while very fine carbonation lends just the right amount of texture; the mouthfeel is befitting of the taste is accompanies.    After recently trying a series of light, caramel-colored brown ales, this was a revelation. Palo Santo Marron comes across more like an imperial doppelbock than a traditional brown ale. It wouldn’t be hyperbole to say this tastes very much like a barrel-aged Celebrator. It has definitely earned some of my respect for what I’d previously considered an overrated brewery.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Appearance: Dark brown pour yet opaque in the glass when put up to the light. Two finger light brown head     Smell: Sweet malt (caramel, toffee), vanilla, light chocolate, dark fruit such as black cherry and figs, wood    Taste: Upfront is that sweet malt (caramel, toffee) character that quickly transitions into vanilla and very light chocolate, perhaps a touch of dark fruits in there, and finishes with all the notes mentioned with a undertone of wood.     Mouthfeel: Heavy body; Goes down just fine considering the abv. with moderate alcohol presence and a dry, slightly bitter finish    Overall: Im admittedly not a big fan of Dogfish, but this one surprised the hell out of me. Every time i take a whiff and sip i pull out different aromas and flavors. Its pretty complex from the sweet malt characters to dark fruits, light chocolate, vanilla, and wood. I like how the finish carries on for a while and the woody character along with the dryness is almost like chewing on wood itself. Along with Indian Brown Ale, this is my favorite beer from DFH. They sure know how to make a brown!     This is easily one of my favorite year-round offerings from any brewery available to me.

I've recently begun to step back back a bit from the big stout/porter beers that beat you about the head and neck regardless of how much I love them (see my review of Avery's Mephistopheles for where I stand)... Nevertheless, this brew is up there on my charts. Thick, big and black; it is a force to be reckoned with (keep your smartass racist/phallic interpretations to yourself!). This is quite a departure from what I've come to expect from the guys at Dogfish, for sure. Definitely worth a try if you're thinking of a brute of a beer on a cold winter night. Not recommended for the hop-friendly types that would be offended by a malt-heavy, sweet and severely alcoholic brew... Cheers!

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Revisiting this one as I last reviewed it more than 3 years ago. 12oz bottle (bottled 10/24/2014) into a tulip. Pours a deep, dark brown w/ minimal head.    Aroma is rich and complex, mostly dark sweet malt and gooey molasses/caramel. A hint of chocolate.    Taste is likewise complex. Dark malt, rum-soaked dark fruit, lots of warming booze, vanilla, subtle coconut. Equal parts bitter and sweet.    Mouthfeel is thick and rich. Good carbonation w/ a surprisingly dry finish for such a high ABV beer.    This is definitely a slow sipper, a dessert beer. A triple imperial brown ale.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 The power of suggestion reigns on this label. It is an American Brown Ale, and does indeed pour very brown, with a lovely dark khaki head. We are told that ther will be vanilla and caramel. And there is, certainly present in the nose. But also, a malty note in there as well. Hops are minimally present in the nose. Then the flavor delivers on two of the three promises. There is vanilla. There is caramel (both the candy profile and the malt profile... which was really tasty). There is a nice balance of the sweet with the necessary bitter. I am afraid I cannot detect specifics in the hops as the dominant sweet profiles mask them from my palate.    And then there is the wood. Just don't get it. Wood flavor that is. I understand the concept of practical uses for timber. I just cannot taste much in the way of wood. And I really want to. I want to taste the wood, like oak in a well made white wine (even though I don't like that flavor profile anymore). Or more importantly like wood from an American Bourbon. I know this isn't aged in Bourbon barrels, and I didn't expect that. Just wanted wood flavor period. Didn't get it, so I have no idea what a Palo Santo tree tastes like.    But the beer is damn good.

Poured from the bottle into a glass, the head is two fingers thick and tan with solid lacing, and an extremely dark brown body    I smell the vanilla and caramel mentioned on the label, along with hearty grains.    Tastes like caramel and roasted malts, perhaps a copperish note, and bit of alcohol astringency.    Mouthfeel is slightly more viscous than others, but still very smooth and drinkable. This brew is certainly a sipper.    Overall, a 4.75 for Palo Santo Marron - Dogfish Head Brewery. A great savory sipper to reflect on the day with during a nice film. I will probably pick this up again.

The nose could have been a little more pronounced with some notes proving a little difficult to detect but once given some time to open up things started to be a little more noticeable. The alcohol was fairly well hidden with only small amount coming through and the sweetness in the taste was very nice. A great beer overall and definitely one that I'd like to try again, hopefully I can get my hands on another bottle somehow.

This is definitely a fantastic beer to age. I've never had a 12% beer taste so smooth. Hints of toffee, caramel and chocolate all imparted by the Palo Santo wood. It's such a dark beer you forget it's a brown ale and not a stout. A ton of respect for DFH -- it cost them $140,000 to make the vessel made from Palo Santo Wood. Yet, this is the ONLY beer that's made in that vessel and it's nowhere close to being their top selling beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured 12oz bottle with date of 7/21/14 into DFH Signature glass    Appearance - 4.5/5  Pitch black in color, with about a finger of brown head, which dissipates down to a thin layer. This is how I like to see a brown ale. Well, perhaps a dark opaque brown would be better, but I hate when a "brown ale" is a see-through reddish-brown, as is the case most of the time. So a very opaque appearance is a nice change from the typical brown ale.    Smell - 3.75/5  Deep, rich, roasty chocolate malts, sweet alcohol. Perhaps a little fruitiness.    Taste - 4.5/5  Wood flavor which is similar to oak, but a little different (the Palo Santo wood). I'd say the difference is that it's slightly less smoky and bitter, and a little more sweet. I like it better than oak flavor. Vanilla. Slightly fruity alcohol. The taste of this beer is great. It's hard to describe the complexity of the taste fully.    Mouthfeel - 4.5/5  Medium-full bodied. Extremely smooth and creamy. There is a light amount of carbonation. Perhaps a tad more would be nice, but I think it has close to the perfect amount.    Overall - 4.5/5  Overall, this was a great beer. Firstly, I was a big fan of the Palo Santo wood. It basically took oak taste, and removed some of the aspects of that taste which I didn't like, thus making an even better wood taste. I love the dark, opaque appearance, something that most brown ales lack. The feel of this beer in my mouth was incredible as well. So smooth and creamy, with just the right amount of carbonation (almost). Definitely recommended. I will definitely be picking up more of this in the future.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter    Pours deep, dark, almost completely opaque mahogany with one finger of creamy milk chocolate head. Leave a wispy cap and minimal oily lacing. Aroma is rich and roasty with chocolate notes, dark fruit, charred wood and sweet alcohol. Yum.    Taste is more of the same. Slightly bitter dark chocolate, toffee, a bit of caramel, prunes, vanilla, smoky wood notes, and a sweet warming alcohol finish. SO much going on, but it works in perfect harmony. Mouthfeel is full and viscous. Low carbonation. Coats the palate well, but drinks smoothly without feeling too heavy. Sip carefully, due to the abv, but I find this going down much easier than it should. Alcohol is certianly noticeable, but in a pleasant way that doesn't bother me in the least.    Brown ale....whatever. Drinks more like a stout to me, but they could call this American Brown Dishwater for all I care. Simply one of the best new (to me) beers I've tried in a long time. Would love to age a few...if I can exercise the patience.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5 APPEARANCE: This beer is a black hole. I always thought of it as more of brown in color than black, but nope. It’s black. Trying to shine my iPhone’s flashlight through it is impossible…even at an angle where there is less beer to travel through; the light just gets completely blocked. There is no red hue, no faint little red bulb on the other side of the glass, just blackness. A coffee-colored head foams up to about a finger, but collapses within ten seconds, leaving a paper-thin cap covering the whole surface of the glass minus a little ring just inside from the edge of the glass.    SMELL: A pleasant smell of wood leads the way with hints of everything else; vanilla, nuts, caramel and roasty coffee beans. There is a lot going on here and it’s really nice.    TASTE: There is even more going on in the taste than there was in the nose. Wow, there is a lot of flavor in here. The wood character is strong, but there is also an enormous vanilla character…and caramel as well. The wood, along with some pleasant roasted malt notes serve to even out the sweetness of the big vanilla and caramel. A touch of nuttiness is there as well. And maybe this is just because I am used to this from dark, Dogfish Head beers, but I am also getting some notes of figs and raisins.     MOUTHFEEL: Medium to big bodied, but mostly big. The balance here is nearly perfect. As mentioned in the Taste section, the wood and light roast do a great job of balancing all the other sweet flavors. The sparkle is a little more impressive than I expected, but this is also a silky, smooth beer that seems to just slide right down.    OVERALL: I can’t believe I haven’t reviewed this beer earlier because it has always been one of my favorites from DFH. It surprises and delights me every time I come across this treat. Being unique is great, but to be this different, yet still so well put together is exceptional. It is not every day that a year-round offering from any brewery deserves a 5 in any category, but Palo Santo most certainly does. It is greater than the sum of its parts.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Had on-tap at Hop Cat in Detroit, Michigan. $12 for a snifter (10oz pour)... phew.    Most memorable beer of the night, I'd say... man I was impressed with this beer. So unique and memory sticking, it's as if I just finished it. The table didn't seem especially impressed, but I really was... it's bizarre. On my nose, it smells like wet wood chips after a good rain and almost nothing else... really, I relate it to the dry-down that quite a few men's musky colognes have. For the taste? Well, wow. It's a lot of wood flavor, but also an unexpectedly large amount of red and black licorice with a fair smack of heat from the alcohol. The woodiness is there from beginning to end and is readily apparent, but I don't think it ever becomes overwhelming. It is still no doubt the focal point.    This was a stunning beer and a glaring reminder to me as to why I enjoy craft beer. Not only was it super unique, it was very well crafted... what else should I expect from Dogfish Head? I'll be snagging a bottle of this next time I see it so I can try it again -- it is definitely something one-of-a-kind and special.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 As with many brews from Dogfish Head this is a very unique beer with a unique after tasted that is highly impacted, almost dominated, by the high alcohol content (12%). It has an array of flavors and the after taste comes across as almost tart, certainly more than most brown ales. From the look of the beer as you pour it you expect a very full mouth feel as the beer appears very dark and thick, but surprisingly it has a rather light to moderate mouth feel. I personally really like one bottle, but would not enjoy drinking multiples at one sitting.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Wanted to start trying some of the bigger DFH offerings and this 12% beer caught my eye.    A - Deep dark brown almost black in the glass with some murkiness. Dark khaki head and nice lacing.     S - Tons of of sweet brown smell with caramel, toffee, vanilla, nut and some soft woody like smells mingling in your nose. Sweet but so much deep and maybe a little alcohol. It was complex and amazing all in one snifter.    T - The flavors culminate on your palate with malt, vanilla, caramel, light chocolate, and light coffee. The alcohol is very smooth and is only noticeable in the warming notes that you feel after the swallow. It is definitely on the sweeter side but with the depth there is something that doesn't really detract. Tastes like an amazing Brown but with so much complexity and richness that it contends for one of the best beers I've had.    M - Very high mouth-feel with moderate carbonation. It pours quite thick and is sweet on the palate but the smooth alcohol and helpful carbonation make it not too cloying    Overall, this is a tremendously delicious beer. If KBS or Bourbon County aren't available this beer maybe able to help sooth the big beer blues. There is a ton of flavor that tends to evolve on your tongue. There is no debating that this beer is on the sweeter side of beers but with so much to offer it is hard to not love it. Though there are a few (KBS) that are better than this brew I would think that this would be my new go to when I'm feeling low and Ten Fidy isn't in stock. I HIGHLY recommend you try this awesome brew.    Glass- Snifter

Head is brown, thick and dense. Looks almost like chocolate mousse. Great retention.    S- Caramel, booze, vanilla, a tiny bourbon/woody.    T- So rich. Caramel and vanilla. Roasty, a little boozy. Wood imparts a great depth as well.     M- Full body, of course. Carbonation is light and smooth. Finishes roasty, with a lingering astringency.    O- This one has incredible depth. The wood casks really impart a lot to this one. It should be considered an Imperial Brown Ale, as well. Strong and heavy.

Subtle wood. No noticeable hops.	  T: Vanilla/wood syrup the same texture as a Cabernet Sauvignon. Mellow - no harsh woods & no bitter hops tastes.	Finish is relatively dry.  M: Full bodied syrupy & sticky very thick & not filling, not harsh & don't taste alcohol, perfect low carbonation for sipping or drinking.	  O: Complex, aromatic. Satisfying. Laying some down to age.    Note - this is best fresh as the vanilla and other woody characteristics from the Paraguayan Palo Santo fermentation tanks is noticeably faded after 6 months (see bottle date on the neck of the bottle) and the beer becomes unbalanced and overly sweet. Not recommended for cellaring despite the high abv and wine like characteristics unless you want this to become a barley wine after maybe 2 years or so. I'd drink fresh myself.

Bottled on 7/21/14, served at 55 degrees. Poured almost completely black into a tulip with about an inch of creamy khaki head that dissipates nice and slow to a thick film. Smell is underwhelming, but I pick up fig, raisin, malty sweetness and alcohol. Medium thick and creamy mouth feel with flavors that blend so well it's difficult to single out any one in particular. It tastes like the Philharmonic orchestra sounds. Definitely hides the 12% ABV well, but to me this seems like more of an imperial stout. Someone likened this beer to Oskar Blues Ten Fidy, but this would be like the caramel raisin brother to the chocolate charred coffee that is the Ten Fidy. Overall, this excellent beer has claimed a spot in my top 5 cold weather beers.

The best brown ale I've ever had. Very malty, with enough sweetness to satisfy my wife, but still sufficiently bitter for me. Definite vanilla taste. Dark and thick - a very rich brown ale. At 12% ABV, one ten ounce pour is enough for one night.

It is truly a unique beer and the wood is a flavor of its own. Vanilla and barrel-y boozy flavors follow. The ABV will get you on this one. If I drink one of these other beers become not as necessary. It's worth tasting the difference slightly cold to warm. Holiday dark fruits are there and very nice. I haven't aged this one and I wonder how it would do?

Dog Fish Head's Palo Santo Marron is outstanding. One of my all time favorite beers. So many favors. This brown Ale has an earthy taste that must come from the wooden containers it is aged in The vanilla comes through with just the right amount of sweetness. Very smooth and easy to drink. No bitterness and even though it has a high ABV (12%) it doesn't taste like I'm drinking pure alcohol. If you have never tasted this beer, take my word for it, it's worth a little extra $.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours a thick, vinous and nearly ink black with a thin ring like tan lace that retains well. Strong aromas include dark fruits, coffee, and alcohol. Taste is cloyingly sweet at times and a tad boozy Finish alternates between syrupy dark fruits and bitter alcohol. Thick and full body; a sipper for sure. Overall, this is a nice brew if you want a big warming buzz.(ABV is a whopping 12%) It's drawback is, as mentioned, a tad too much booziness and sweetness. Yet, it's an interesting and unique brew that's in line with DFH's commitment to extreme brewing. I will continue to enjoy from time to time.
