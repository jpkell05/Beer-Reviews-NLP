look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Hazy dark brown, almost black, with lighter brown highlights. Topped by a creamy off white head with great retention and streaky lacing.  Smells dried sweet cherry, plum, fig, date, brown sugar, honey, toffee, toast, caramel, and hay. Rich, sweet, and spicy.  Tastes of dried sweet cherry, plum, fig, date, raisin, brown sugar, honey, molasses, toffee, toasted brown bread, ginger, and hay. Fairly sweet and caramelized throughout, with a moderately spicy and lightly dry finish.  Creamy and pillowy, medium-plus mouthfeel with effervescent carbonation.  A fantastic Belgian ale! One of my favorites.

I've tried this a few times and found it too sweet for my tastes: I'm no expert beer reviewer, and do have a preference for pils, so this is foreign to me. Then I tried it one time with a ripe characterful raw milk brie cheese, and I loved it.  This time round the bottle is a little older (not sure if that a factor). the cheese isn't so good, but I'm loving the beer:  sure it's sweet -- but it's complex sweet -- and there's a perfectly balancing bitterness comes through after.  Carbonation is very fine, like bottle conditioned, the phrase 'melt in your mouth' came to mind -- not logical yet I found myself sipping again and again to get that wonderful smooth prickly mouthfeel with that lovely bitter finish.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Bottle, 2018.    Deep amber, lace.    Drive-by aroma is full of pear. Very strong and distinct. Taking a deeper sniff broadens that to phenols reminding me of Duvel.     Taste continues to concentrate on the fruit and the phenols with a bit of alcohol. Body is moderate, carbonation just right. A complex but not imposing bitterness envelopes the tongue, mixing a bit of hop-derived with yeast-derived notes. In a version this young, the phenols are still a bit rough around the edges, especially as the beer warms up. Alcohol is therefore a bit too prominent.    I wish this site allowed an easier way to review different ages of a beer. This one is still too clumsy to live up to its potential, yet it is already a very good classic. Having tried to clone Chimay myself, the nimbleness of this is actually quite impressive. The yeast very easily produces over the top aromas. Which gets tiring. Not here.

F - Medium bodied with a slight creaminess, slightly sticky, in a very good way.    A definite classic. Another one of my all time favorites.

A: Pours a clear, copper color with three finger, tan to light brown, foamy head with very strong retention, but modest lacing.  S: Lightly tangy/tart at first. Aroma of caramel to molasses malt and toffee.  T: Lightly sweet. Palate follows the nose. Bitterness a little in excess of what would count malty sweetness.   M: Light to medium bodied with solid, persistent carbonation.  O: Creamy, smooth, and delicious. Complex and flavorful. An excellent Abbey Ale.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Honestly one of the best overall beers I have ever enjoyed. Very pleasant sweet and spiced maltiness with virtually no bitterness.

O: Smooth, sweet finish. A bit stronger and sweeter than Chimay Premiere.     Great Abbey bier, great buy. In the US, pilsner and india pale ale overwhelmingly dominate the market, but it feels good to go back to the basics and the fundamentals. Abbey bier for life.

Smell was of malt and spice.  Taste was again spicy, a little bitter, but great complex flavors.  Feel was silky smooth, good carbonation, easy drinking for 9% ABV.  Overall, a great dark ale true to the Trappist traditions, and so very enjoyable.

L: Pours with a deep red cola body, so dark it seems opaque unless held to light. If you don't stir the sediment, it comes out very clear. Beautiful arcs of fine bubbles lace the glass and the khaki film of head lasts forever.    S: Soothing, sweet and creamy, with soft notes of brown sugar, vanilla and coconut held up by rich almond and black cherry, prune and fig. The base of the finish is soothing oat bread with clove, tobacco and a hint of toffee, with toasted acidic notes trailing off like sourdough crust.    T: Nutty almond swirls dives into sweet vanilla and creamy macadamia nut, beaching on a shore of dried apricots and raisins where coconuts and tobacco are getting toasted nearby on an oak fire.    F: Nutty, creamy, fuzzy, and dry. Perfect.    O: My first time giving a beer full marks across the board. A delicacy, without a doubt. Then again, the price point is fifty cents an ounce.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured out of an 11.2 oz bottle, this beer is a mainly clear, dark copper/amber brown color with a light tan head that’s well over an inch thick when first poured that to a thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with some decent lacing. Aromas of toasted, bready, caramel malt sweetness along with some dark fruit notes of dates, plums, and a hint dark red apple. The taste is pretty much the same, with toasted, bready caramel malt sweetness that gives way to some toffee notes, a bit of Belgian candy sugar, a bit of Belgian yeast, and the aforementioned dark fruits. No discernible hop presence of course. Has a smooth, slightly prickly, yet smooth and slightly frothy, creamy, dull views mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish with a good, sweet aftertaste. A good beer here.    Eric

Taste: Raisins, dark chocolate, and hops are the predominate flavors. Subsequent sips have some banana esters.    Mouthfeel: Thick, but quite carbonated.

Smell - Lots of dark notes like molasses, raisins, and plums. I'd love for a scented candle that smells like this.    Taste - Similar molasses and raisin tones from the nose, but also a bit of banana, cinnamon, and pear. Every sip was something new, and one 11.2 ounce bottle definitely isn't enough to experience it all.    Feel - Thick and creamy with a very low carbonation, almost a flat feeling. The 9% alcohol doesn't show itself.    Overall - Exciting and rewarding all around. Belgian monks sure know how to brew.

This beer is going to make you ponder your mortality and glad you find yourself among the living.     The Rochefort 10 was tried side by side and suffered from the comparison.

Paired it with Indian food, which was a pretty lovely experience overall. Awesome stuff.

Teeters on the edge of being cloyingly molasses-sweet on the finish, but doesn't quite fall off  F -- Big and chewy. Well carbonated thanks to the bottle conditioning.  O -- Solid Belgian.

Foamy 3 finger beige head. Huge retention but minimal lacing.     Smells of caramel, malts, and dark fruit. Sweeter than I was expecting.     Taste is roasty, malty, and sugary. Caramel and raisins dominate. Belgian yeast are present.    Feel is medium for the style (heavy relative to other beers). High carbonation. Some alcohol warming but surprisingly drinkable all things considered. Perhaps a bit thin.    Overall fantastic. Smooth and sweet.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 750mL bottle poured into a Chimay chalice at fridge temp 9% ABV. Bottle code is L14-374. The beer pours bright and medium brown in color. There are ruby highlights if the glass is held to the light. Head is dense light brown in color and leaves significant lacing. Aromas of caramel, dark sugar, cherries, plums and raisins all take turns presenting themselves with each sip. The taste follows with waves of flavor. Dark sugar, dark fruit, cherry and malt all intermix for a unique flavor combination. This beer is neither sweet nor bitter. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, gently carbonated from bottle conditioning, soft on the tongue yet finishes dry. Overall, excellent. This is great stuff and certainly not an experience to pass over.

A breadiness in the background and perhaps some caramel and brown sugar. A warming and sumptuous beer to savour.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 The appearance had a dark brown colored body with a massive three finger white head. The head must last for about a good four minutes before it died. Minimal spider web lacing speckled the sides and slid fairly quickly down the sides of the glass. The smell had raisins and cherries with light pears and caramels in the background, slightly in a bready sort of way. The yeast is very subdued, but its there. The taste takes all of the previously mentioned flavors and combined altogether in a sweet bready yet somewhat earthy sort of way. The palate sat about a medium with nothing remotely close to having any sort of harshness on the tongue. As many times as I’ve had this, this is probably the smoothest most Belgian beer on the market. It leaves a sweet sticky aftertaste and a slightly dry finish. Though at 9%, I’d still say fairly sessionable. Overall, this is a Belgian I like, probably because the yeast is tamed well. Nice dessert and night cap!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 L - red-brown beer, with a ruby glow when held against the light. Big hazelnut head. I almost didn't want to drink it.  S & T - raisins, slight candi sugar, milk chocolate on the back-end, toasty maltiness. Rum-raisin chocolate bonbons.  F - nice and creamy, so so smooth.    O - Take your time when drinking this. The tastes evolve and you discover more and more as you sip it over half an hour. It was quite the experience, and I'm not even that big a fan of the Belgians.    I do recommend this one.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Uncorked 2016 into Mountain Layers Belgian Goblet. Pop! What a smell!     Head galore! 3/4 ths of the glass was fine light tan rich dense foam. Crumbling down to a nice even layer, it puts off a rich decadent brandy or port-like scent; dark sweet fruits and quite boozy (9% abv).   Deep dark golden brown appearance is perfect. It glows a fiery red orange with a phone light behind it, while tiny bubbles race to the top.    Taste follows nose; sweet, rich candied plums with and added alcohol punch, but a perfectly crisp dry finish. Decadent.    My favorite aspects of Chimay Grande Reserve Ale are its crispness and dryness, which fight to overcome the rich sweetness. A little too sweet out front and a bit too much alcohol smell for me, but certainly top notch for sure.  I should have warmed this up a bit longer, I think. The malts seem to start showing up as it warms.    May be perfect for a Christmas or New year party, after smashin favorites first.

Pours a dark brown, a little garnet on the edges in the light, fairly opaque, with a huge three inch foamy head on an average pour. Lots of foamy lacing. The smell is Belgian yeast, candi sugar, caramel, dates, figs, malt, some spices- cloves, for one. Light black pepper in the head, a little cola aroma. The taste is also strong on the yeast, much more malt than the nose, caramel, figs, candi sugar, dates. A quick flash of light bitterness up front. Smooth, creamy, a solid, medium body, well carbonated- a little on the high side.    A classic and top notch Belgian Strong Dark, with well blended flavors and a big, complex aroma. This is a beer everyone should try.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Chimay Blue, one of the world's great beers, or so they say.    I've been trying various versions of this beer over the last 2 years. I've had 5 samples of it, each one has been different in some way. Review rating is based on the 750ml bottle dated 2017 sourced direct from Belgium in March. This version has a different label than 750ml bottle bought at the same time in the U.S. dated 2016, which was imported into Texas.    The first copy of the beer I had was a 12 oz bottle from a bottle shop. I was disappointed as it had a cardboardy flavor. Cardboard flavor is indicative of a beer well past its prime, yet this beer should store well for half a decade. Perhaps it had been on that shelf in the bottle shop for a decade, or stored at 80 degrees F for awhile. Both those things are possible.    The next sample was from a 12 oz bottle in a restaurant. I found this quite good, but not one of my favorites. The characteristic Trappist yeast flavor and fruity nose, combined with some maltiness; is what made it good. Still, I wouldn't say it was spectacular. Hard to see what all the fuss was about.    But I persevered. The next sample I had at a tap room in Seattle that had around 150 taps. I asked what version of Chimay they had. When the waitress came back and said "Chimay Reserve, Blue"; I immediately bought a glass. It came in a Chimay chalice. The person I was with, who doesn't like beer, stated that it really looked good. It was quite a site with it's glittering glass, frothy foam, and brownish orange color. And drinking it was a fantastic experience. One of the best beers I've ever had. The memory of it lingered the rest of the week, despite having a couple other great beers afterwards.    On that, I obtained a couple 750ml bottles from a US distributor hoping that the larger size would be more resilient to storage issues, and more like the draft version. While I initially enjoyed these bottles, a soapiness to the flavor began to bother me, and left a disagreeable memory. I was beginning to despair at being able to repeat the Seattle experience. These bottles were dated "2016" on the cork.    I found a Belgium site that would ship direct to the U.S. and got a 750ml bottle of the Belgium version, which I just drank moments ago. This bottle was dated on the cork and label as "2017". And it had no soapy taste whatsoever. I wouldn't say it was up to the level of the Seattle version as the fruity notes were not as pronounced, but I loved it and will probably get some more (direct from Belgium if possible). I don't know if the difference between this one and the US labeled one was because one was 2017 and one was 2016, because they ship inferior stock to the US, or because of storage issues; but I think that the fact that the Belgium-sourced sample was a year younger is a good sign for getting things direct from Belgium.    The Seattle on-tap sample would be a 5; but obviously consistency is something of a problem.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 From a 330ml bottle served at 14 degrees Celsius into a chalice. The bottle has been cellared for a good handful of months however I lost track :)    Look: Excellent appearance from the colour to the head (given the style). It pours a clear dark brown with red highlights. One finger of foamy, tan head that settles to an impressive cap after three minutes. The cap remains until your last sip. Poor lacing... and here I thought my glass was beer-clean...?    Smell: Quite strong an aroma with notes of caramel, banana, Belgian yeast, brown bread, and dark fruits. Hints of peppery spice and herbal hops to improve the overall balance. There's no doubt the malts and esters are here to shine.    Taste: Exactly what the aroma promises. Intense and balancing towards sweet. Not cloying. Prominent estery notes of dark fruit and banana as well as bready malts, and caramel. Absolutely delicious.    Feel: Medium-full body with high carbonation. Creamy, warming, and prickly with a smooth alcohol-warmth.    Overall: Fantastic example of the style. Malty-rich with strong esters and a hop character that brings it all together. I'm a little sad the vessel is empty... I better buy another one.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A 2012, 150th anniversary bottle. A careful pour at cellar temp yields a finger of off white head. The head remains for a good 8 minutes, fed by constant streams of bubbles throughout the glass. The deep ruby color is highlighted by light red when held up to the light.  Dark fruits, particularly cherry, dominate the smell. There is also a sour smell, reminiscent of an oud bruin. This smell is less noticeable as the beer warms.  Dark fruits also dominate the taste. The sourness in the smell is not present. A sweetness in the middle of the tongue is followed quickly by a bitterness on the swallow. There is no sign of the 9% abv.  Overall, this is beer is excellent! The five years of storage has done no harm...

Do not get me wrong, this is a nice beer and you can sense the Christmas beer specialness about it.  Like all Belgian beers, not to be confused with modern day craft ales.  Worth a try? Absolutely! As good as a Gouden Carolus Classic or Christmas? No!

Big fizzy head that dies quick.     Smell: Apples, pears, red grapes, alcohol, yeast, toffee, citrus    Taste: More of the same, with date-like sweetness, lots more toffee, fruit punch with caramel sweetness instead of typical sweetness, with a surprisingly bright, clean, caramely, citrusy, bready finish. Goddamn that is delicious.     Feel: Way too easy to drink, only a little warmth at the very end. Sticks to the mouth a little bit, but doesn't feel cloying or overly sticky. Lightly effervescent and clean.     Yeah this is delicious. Too easy to drink, and full of flavor and lovely mouthfeel.

Taste is nicely carbonated with a moderate mouthfeel. Nice malt character, dark fruits (prune and raisin), a slight spice, and pleasant citrusy finish.    2013:    Aroma is alluring. Cold, it smelled of pure apple juice. As it warmed, pear and a ton of prune juice were noted.    Taste is much lighter and almost thinner than the 2016. Very effervescent. The Belgian spice and yeast notes are a little muted. Still ample dark fruits and citrus.    Overall, regardless of age, this is a phenomenal example of the style. I found four years to be too much, as the beer became a bit too thin, but the aroma on the 2013 was far more complex. From this, I would say a 2 year age would be my reccomendation. It gets a 93/100 overall.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 330ml bottle poured into a chalice. This one is 2015 reserve.    Deep ruby brown hue, the pour quickly builds up majestic light tan creamy head that doesn’t go anywhere until the last sip with its exceptional strength of retention. The head looks very silky smooth and so velvety. There is vast amount of sticky lacing ring and wave along the way down.    Mild estery affair reminds me of prune, raisin, and dark cherry. Malt is biscuity, dough, caramelized, yet sometimes chocolate and toasted. Sugar, honey, treacle, spice, and floral notes draw down to add in more complexity.    The mellow fruity ester that exhibits in a nose also being displayed through the palate sensation with notes of prune, raisin, and dark cherry. Treacle, honey, and sugar sweetness reveal in the middle along with all those malty flavors of toasted bread, biscuit, slight chocolate, and caramel. Big phenol and spice is at the end together with peppery and medicinal hint while some hop bitterness also reinforces in the finish. The aftertaste is long-lasting with spice, bitter, sweet, and slight fruity touch.    Medium to full body with some bold touch through the palate, carbonation is quite low but it is crisp enough to carry all the things well under the smooth mouthfeel and pleasant palate. Finish is very dry.    Great example of what Belgian’s strong dark ale is all about by its sheer complexity without forsaking drinkable yet quaffable quality, it is so tasty and alcohol is very well hidden making me finish it so fast, excellent brew.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Excellent beer although I believe it suffers having to make its way across the pond to the U.S. Would love to give a pipping fresh bottle a try but never ceases to impress.

Great lacing that never fades. Poured a little too much so ended up with some sediment but that was my fault.  S-Malty smell on the nose with a fruity woody aroma  T-Dark fruits with hints of raisins and cherries, malty with a bit of sweetness and a slight alcohol burn at the end  M-Bubbly on the tongue, wonderful carbonation and smooth and silky  O-Very complex beer that changes with every taste, yeast comes through the malt well and the yeast has obviously attenuated well due to the lack of sweetness and the dryness of the beer. Overall a great example of a monastic beer.

This beer is delicious. When someone tries to recreate it and misses the mark even a little bit, it’s practically undrinkable.

A slightly sweet caramel, slightly tart, with some hints of spice, apple, malts and breadiness. This ale is super smooth and rich, but has a wonderful carbonation that makes drinking it very dangerous, as it goes down easy and refreshing--but at 9ABV, that means you'll be feeling fine quickly. So, slow down and enjoy. The slightest bitterness at the end, but overall, well done. A classic Belgian Strong example....

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Pours a rich burnt plum color with a finger of foamy, dark-khaki head. Considering it was poured into a Chimay chalice, that's a lot of head. No lacing left behind. Mulled spices, Belgian yeast, plum, fig, and rolled malts give this beer a hearty aroma. While the aroma has a heavy malt base, it remains sweet and centered around the plum, fig, and spices. Flavor profile is smooth, opening with mulled spices, plum, and fig. Excellent decay of flavors as the flavor profile shows its Belgian side with a zip of Belgian yeast. Nice Belgian, bready finish. Mouth feel is smooth, with a slightly medium-thick consistency. It's easy to sip and savor, without filling up the stomach or palate too much. Overall, a well crafted beer with stand-up Belgian qualities. A pleasant sipper that refrains from being too bitter, and while it does have some malt body, it remains well within the realm of sweet drink-ability.     Served in a Chimay chalice.

O: An all around treat. Great Belgian Dark Strong, and one of the beers that immediately comes to mind when I consider the style. Can't go wrong here.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Poured into a tulip from a bottle marked 2015.    Appearance a dark brown, quite cloudy with 1.5 fingers of fluffy light-tan head.    Fruity on the nose. I pick up dark fruit, cherries and a raisin sweetness.    The flavour is dominated by malt sweetness, raisins and cherries. Faint hints of vanilla and dark wood. Brings to mind a sweet Christmas cake.    Medium-to-full body, nice and smooth with enough carbonation that there's some crispness in there too. It makes for a good balance. The aftertaste is as boozy and warm as you'd expect from a 9% ABV beer, but it's masked by the lingering raisin and malt sweetness.    Overall I'd call it fruity, malty and a pleasure all around. Quite a lot going on in here and I look forward to the next time.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a snifter.    The appearance is a pretty hazy reddish-brown. Has good lacing that lingers well.    The aroma is dark fruit, raisins, cherry, and big malt sweetness. Also some fruity esters from the yeast.    The taste is raisins, dark fruit, cherries, big malt sweetness, and estery yeast notes.    The palate is medium plus with a nice lingering sweetness. The maltiness lingers pleasantly.    Overall this is a world class Belgian strong that I am happy to have finally tried.

It was poured in a Pilsner glass so you can imagine. Aroma of plump raisins, dark cherries, roasted malt, fruity esters. Taste is cherries, fruitcake, raisins, honeyed malt, caramel and some boozy heat that warms the palate. Great beer - still stands tall.

Of course poured into the classic Chimay glass with awesome aroma and dark color. Light caramel taste that complemented Le Grande Chimay Trappist grilled cheese sandwich.

Feel is largely remarkable for the warming finish that leaves you happy and warm inside. Overall a lovely belgian strong dark ale - really one of the best examples of the style.

The aroma boasts toffee, wet brown sugar, butter, and fruit pudding with boozy raisins. There are some underlying autumnal spices which carry through to the tongue, but this is altogether more subdued and less complex than other, more ballsy quad-ish beers.

Lots of alcohol.    So much alcohol. Dark fruit. Raisins, plums, the usual suspects. Its just a style I can't get that down with. Brown sugar in smaller supply. Caramel, burnt. Carbonation good. I dunno, there's just a bitter toffee, overripe spoiled dark fruit thing going with pronounced alcohol that always has me wondering how this got to be so almost universally loved.

Dark mohagany with a huge soapy head that sticks around and leaves a nice lace coating on the glass. Aromas are very nice with dried stone fruit, dates, brown sugar. Taste has some fruit and brown sugar as well. Mouth feel is great...medium body, creamy, well carbed, easy drinking. Overall, this is a great Belgian Trappist.

While the R8 is a little more classier of the two, this one is like eating a delicious home cooked meal. Body is a tad thicker than the R8. A notch below in complexity but beautiful in its simplicity. I could drink more of this beer in one sitting than the R8. It is that smooth, balanced and gets better and better the more I drink it. Bless this beer

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A classic poured from the 750 ml bottle in a snifter. This fine Belgian pours a   dark brownish mahogany, lightly cloudy, with a fantastic head of off white foam   that subsides to a thick ring, nice thick layer, and sports the signature lacing known   for the Chimay brands. Nose of astringent booze, raisins, apples, and light candy  sugars. Flavors lightly exceed the nose with raisin, apple, and pear notes touched by  brown sugars and awash in cola and sweet malts with a touch of bitterness from hops  and a nice light yeast note on the back with a touch of Belgian spice. Excellent mouth feel, tingly   and invigorating, lively carbonation, subtle dryness on the aftertaste.....awesome.   I must admit, that while it is available at many grocery stores it is always a treat to be able  to enjoy fantastic craft that is available in wide distribution.     Always a pleasure.    Their cheeses are fantastic as well by the way.    Cheers

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This is one of the best Belgian Strong Dark Ale's I've ever had. I'd say it takes a close second to Gulden Draak, which is my #1 in this style. It's more carbonated than most, but that's not a bad thing. There isn't a lot on the nose; sweet malt, dark fruit. Taste is bready, sweet, slight molasses flavor, barely detectable hops. Mouthfeel is medium-full. It pours a thin white head that recedes quickly, minimal lacing. Overall this is one heck of a beer. Perfect for a cool early autumn evening outside.

After awhile that fades though and the beer is primed for drinking.     S - I'm actually not getting much on the nose for this one...maybe some freeze dried bananas, a little clove, some amaretto.     T - Flavor is punchy. Lots of cherry, dark wheat, following with peach, ash, and some metallic flavors.     F - Super creamy, nice carbonation to level it out. Dry finish.     Overall, it's not the knockout I thought it'd be. I'm not biased, I just write reviews on how i experience the beer. I think Chimay Blue is okay, but not legendary.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 The beer poors nice in a glass, it is fizzy and it has a good head, 1.5 fingers. It is a dark beer, clear, and it looks a clear dark red when hold to the light. It smells sweet , I got notes of nuts, its got a bit of a caramel smell to it. Nice hoppy smell, notes of coffee and chocolate. The taste is nice and warm, hop flavor, I taste a bit of a sweet,l. Nice balance of flavors, you can't taste it's a 9% apv(!!) beer. It's very smooth on the tongue, nice warm feel in the throat. The aftertaste is of nuts and chocolate.   Overall I would return to this beer, it is nice example of a dark Belgium beer, it proofs once again trappist beer is on the top of the league, these monks know how to brew beer.   It certainly is a nice beer to drink when serving a meal with fish, or to enjoy when relaxing, and relief some stress.

Figs, prunes, and raisin bread aromas distinguish themselves from the malt.  To that add wine grapes, roasted malt, and spice at the end (or is that tannin?).  Full, but not heavy, mouthfeel, creamy and almost wet on the finish.  This was really nice after my ceviche.

This is definitely a good beer and top of the style in my opinion. Pours a deep brown color with a rich creamy head. Smells of fig and raisin bread. Taste of dark fruits, prunes, arisen and a bit of oak and port wine. Medium to heavy mouthfeel, juicy and a bit creamy.

The aroma of malt, and molasses is quite prevalent with a subtle aroma of raisin. The taste is of prunes, malt and molasses with a subtle note of caramel on the back end especially as the beer warmed. In spite of it's higher ABV it does not come across as boozy. Overall a very good beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Appearance: deep, deep dirty brown, almost like prune juice but not as thick and with more brown hues than prune juice. The head is beige and soapy, very thick, and retains a half-finger's width, leaving some spots on the glass.     The aroma is of honey-wheat brown bread. It's got honey sweetness, and a background of yeast and banana chips. Maybe some raisin. As the beer warms, the banana chip aroma becomes more pronounced. No alcohol on the aroma.     The taste is the same as the aroma. No alcohol. The bitterness is mild to none.    The mouthfeel is medium to heavy and carbonated.     The finish is somewhat dry.    Overall, this beer is more mild than, say, St. Bernardus Abt. 12, both in flavor and aroma, as well as alcohol level. Yet, it costs more in the areas in which I've seen both products. That's something to consider (and I mean that in a neutral way). Nonetheless, this is, hands-down, a world-class beer.

The cork made a huge stomp that made a mark at my ceiling. So far, so good.  Brown orangeish color with a huge beige head with great retention. It got darker later.  Nice malty and fruity aroma with notes of prunes, molasses, orange marmelade, coconut, vanilla, figos and mild Port wine. Brazilian “manjar de coco” would be a fair description for what predominates in the nose.  Very complex flavor with notes of prunes, molasses, peppery yeast, cloves, noble hops, burnt coconut, umami, toasted malts, cinnamon, apple puree, candi sugar, rose petals, a bit of banana and vineous fruits. I should stop looking for fruther notes. Finishes smoothly dry with a medium bitterness.  Bordering full body with velvety carbonation. I didin’t feel its 9% alcohol at this point.  Excellent Belgian Dark Strong Ale. This is surprisingly elegant, complex and fruity without being overly sweet.  This is a treaty and a big reference for the style and it should be forbidden to be drank too young.

A little bitter orange and yeast with a little fruit cake. Very round in the aroma with a nice sweetness. The flavors are as scents. But with a little cocoa and a little caramel. There was a little lees. Is a real good balance in it all. Rich body. Moderate Carbonic. A little sweetness and a little small dry. Good roundness sitting on the palate just long.

I was turned on to chimay about 20 years ago and it was very hard to find a beer as good until the last few years when craft beer has really become popular. The Grand Reserve has a bold strong flavor that keeps you coming back for more. It has a strong malt smell and pours dark with a good head. Their are many great beers around today but not many have been brewing as long as Chimay.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This iconic Belgian strong dark ale pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a slight red tint and a very large tan foamy head. The smell is rich and malty with a hints of alcohol and dark fruit. The flavor is robust with a good kick of alcohol that hits you right away with flavors of dates, brown bread, and honey mixed in culminating in a spicy finish. The body is somewhere between medium and heavy. Everything about this beer is classic strong dark ale. It is really a nice drinking experience and everything is well balanced. My only criticism would be that it is maybe not as complex as I would have hoped. It’s rated 2nd for the style and I think it should undoubtedly be in the top 10 if not top 5, but it’s maybe very slightly overrated. I liked the Allagash Odyssey a little better for example.

Zesty feel on the tongue with high carbonation. Very good beer, but not my favorite in the style.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 33cl bottle    Appearance: looks like coca-cola, black with a 2 finger head of medium bubbles. Weak lacing. Lots of carbonation.    Smell: black fruits like fig and raisins with a touch of bitterness, brown sugar, sweet malts.    Taste: fig and raisin dry fruitiness, molasses, a bit of cocoa.    Mouthfeel: strong carbonation produces a somewhat fizzy initial feeling. Creamy. Strong alcohol presence. Bitter chocolate aftertaste.    Overall: nice beer, I liked it better that La Trape Dubbel and Quadrupel offerings for example, but it's still 2 steps under Rochefort 10.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 11.3 ounce bottle poured into a chalice     A: Pours a cloudy dark amber color with a big frothy head that did not last, bottle was gushing when I opened it, lots of yeast even with a gentle pour.    A: Dark fruits like figs, dates, raisins, plums, brown sugar, toffee, no alcohol at all on the nose, slight aroma of spice and banana, smells pretty good.     T: Like the nose, dark fruits, slight spice, hint of banana, toasted toffee, very smooth and easy to drink, semi-dry finish with a mix of flavors lingering in the aftertaste.    M: Medium bodied with lots of carbonation    O: While the flavors don't punch as this bottle might be old, but overall a nice balance of flavors and aromas, very drinkable for 9% ABV, complex and deep, a beer I will definitely reach for again.

Medium-bodied, high carbonation, bubbly, sweet, and creamy smooth.    Overall, masterfully layered and extremely pleasing creamy smoothness with a nice fizzy carbonation to wipe the palate clean.

Started with a big off-white head, which diminished to a tan bubbly film.    S) Sour-tinged odour with a definite candy sugar. Over smell of very fresh fruit cake. Bits of coconut, and alcohol.    T) Quite sweet, nice deep sweet malt flavour, topped off with a hop bitterness hint to balance. Carbonation gives it a sourish edge.    F) Nicely carbonated. Very easy to drink at this ABV. No bitterness in the aftertaste, just a very easy drinking strong beer.    O) Very easy drinking strong Belgian bier, huge value at Tesco at £2.49.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3.5 No bottle or import date that I can see. The bottle I am reviewing is the 750ml corked and caged version.    Appearance: The body is dark brown that is completely opaque. Even in the light I don't get any color pinpoints. There is a bit of light that makes it through the bottom edge of the glass showing just a lighter version of the brown body. The head is thick and fluffy with a light tan color. It stays up for a while then gently fades to a short cap leaving some fine lacing in the glass.    Aroma: I get some bubblegum and a very light date aroma. Overall it doesn't have a lot of aroma and the dominant scent is bubblegum.    Taste: Very light flavors here to match the aroma. A bit of that bubblegum flavor mixed with a touch of sweet brown sugar. The finish is a very faint tea leaf flavor. The flavors are nice but faint.    Mouthfeel: The beer is exceptionally smooth and easy to drink. It is very well carbonated and the carbonation really helps to push the beer across the palate and deliver the light flavors to the corners of the mouth. Again the beer is very easy to sit back and enjoy because it has no rough edges whatsoever. I do wish it has a bit more of a finish.    Overall: It's a decent Belgian Strong Dark Ale. There are many other Belgian Strong Dark Ales that I would prefer over this one but preference is subjective. The light simple flavor and character of the beer would make it easy for anyone to enjoy.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Probably the best Trappist/Belgian strong dark ale and overall the best beer I ever tasted. I only recently came to that conclusion.  Chimay blue is one of the 1st Trappist, stong beers I tried in my life. At that time, I was 17 years old, I liked beer, no matter what type and to me Chimay blue tasted just like a trappist, I couldn't exactly tell a difference with a Westmalle dubbel. Later I came to appreciate the differences, but to me Chimay still was just a trappist you could buy everywhere. Beers like Rochefort or St. Bernardus weren't readily available and just how it works in the mind, unknown, more rare beers always taste better. I have dismissed Chimay the last two decades, always chose Rochefort, St. Bernardus, La Trappe and recently Jopen Ongelovige Thomas over the blue labeled bottle.  But Chimay blue beats all of them in my opinion. And for the biggest part because it leaves no strong sweet aftertaste. The aftertaste isn't exactly dry, but it doesn't stick too long. All the other trappist/abbey beers to a certain extent blurr or flatten the taste after a while. The best example is the Rochefort 8, the sweet aftertaste ruins the experience to me.   Chimay has the ideal balance between sweet and bitter. It is smooth (non-boozy) like a Rochefort 10 and spicy like a St. Bernardus, and the amount of carbonation is spot on. True the sweetness isn't that round and smooth like a Rochefort 10, it is more stingy (for lack of a better word) but it leaves with little trace, therefore every new sip tastes great, not muted.    Do note: with this beer it really is important to serve it at a minimum temperature of 10 degrees Celcius, not any colder, because when served too cold the taste is watery and muted. I usually drink this beer at (slightly lower) room temperature, 17 up to 19 degrees Celcius works great for me.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Look--Pours a unique murky-copper with faint maroon highlighting that suggests a "fruitiness" right out of the gate. The highlighting isn't "off-putting" but it is a bit strange. The head and lacing dissipate almost immediately, which isn't uncommon with this style, so no "mark down" for that.    Smell--Agressive nose of dried fruit--fig, raisin, (prune perhaps?) with bready and banana notes that stay forward throughout the drinking experience. Almost reminds me of a banana bread with dried fruit. Unlike some better strong Trappists (i.e. Rochefort 8 or 10) this doesn't modify much as the beer warms.    Taste--Very smooth and drinkable considering the alcohol content, but is rather sweet and boozy compared to even stronger similar offerings. Unlike some others that develop a subtle bitter-chocolate note as they come up in temperature, this one just gets sweeter. The carbonation doesn't have quite enough staying power to provide some balance.    Feel--Warming in a very pleasant way, and very drinkable.     Overall--I like this one, but wouldn't rate it as high as a Rochefort 8 because it lacks that extra "nuance," and stays a little too sweet throughout the drink. Still an excellent Trappist.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 During the course of my career, I have had this ale at least a dozen times. I kept this bottle for almost five years, about the length that some claims it is at its richest, fruitiest stage.   I agree.  What I might have done wrong is that its high carbonation (its only flaw in my book) does recede after a ten minutes... so the second half of this bottle was better than the first.    MJ's "Great Beers of Belgium" gives Chimay 4 pages. But then, he really likes the Trappists.  MJ's 1999 "Guide" gave it 4 of 4 stars (very rare) and talked at length about how the fruitiness mellows with age.  As one of the most frequently reviewed beers in the world, it deserves to be on the "!001" list.    6/24/17 Bottled in 2015 (see cork.) Maybe this gets better with age, but it is insanely great right now. Had with my world famous ratatouille stew and lamb. Increased rating because Feel truly is exceptional and Overall because I want to have this again. Maybe I will hold it for 4 years and double my patience.

Bitter snickerdoodle. Aroma is subtle, can’t smell from more than a few inches away.     Taste: cinnamon, banana Belgian-like. Subtle but distinct alcohol finish. Can definitely taste the 9%.    Mouthfeel: holy carbonation, Batman ! super fizzy, bubbly, effervescent, aggressive.     Overall, a great Belgian Dark Strong Ale. Definitely a sipper, to be enjoyed slowly.

Yet with a bit of agitation in will move quickly. It bubbles for the life of the beer with a slight wobble it will reveal that it is not a quad... but close. It has many of the characteristics. A rich flavor profile, complete with the dark sweet flavors or currants, raisins and some lighter sweet notes of toffee. It's color is almost entirely dark, except for the brown to deep ruby reds hinting at the edges. Indicating the rich malt bill that builds this miraculously fine beer. Good to the last gulp.

O - I like how creamy this beer is, but I feel the flavor bottoms out just a bit too "low" for my tastes. It feels out of place. I would say 80-85% of the flavor is perfectly in place, with just a faint hint of it "off," like a flat note in a song.

I got this Chimay as a gift so I am lucky to be trying it, since I probably would never buy this beer for myself. Now onto the beer. This beer has to be the hardest beer I've had to open, but it didn't spray all over the place. ( like my stone enjoy after brett IPA) The reserve pours nice and dark, i was surprised by this. I was thinking that it was gonna be a light color. As soon as you open this beer you can smell it from across the room. I feel like this beer is gonna grow on me if i was to have it again. Scored low this round, next time might be better.

Smell doesn't really stand out, slightly sweet grain from the field.    Taste reminds me a bit of rye whiskey, with a bit of banana and spices. Sweetness doesn't hit for me until toward the end.    Feel is mildly carbonated, with some nice creaminess.    Good, but maybe don't let it sit too long before consuming. My recollection of earlier bottles is that there was more sweetness.

This is a complex and substantial beer, which has a masterful blend of flavours, not competing, but harmonising with each other like a fine symphony. Every Grand Réserve Blue is an historical occasion.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a wine glass from a 750 mil bottle    A - a hazy nearly deep brown with a two finger almost ran off white head and little to no lacing    S - lots of yeast both bready and Belgium notes, floral hops, fruity hops, lots of sweet malts, sweet and dry grain, sweet booze note, oak, dead and living earth, crisp water and Caramelized bananas.    T - wood, green/brown earth, lots of soil, fruity/floral hops, sweet and toasted malts, dry and sweet grains, banana bread yeast, lots of fruit, rich malts,     M - light yet full bodied, well balanced, nice complexity, medium minus acidity, medium plus carbonation and a malty delight from start to end    D/O - really easy to drink with lots of flavor. Huge malt with a slight hop all while being very refreshing and pleasant to drink. Cracked one open on a cool humid night and is/was perfection. Pairs well with most foods and desserts but it pairs the best with itself (meaning opening more than one in a night). Great any day, any time of year and as often as you'd like to enjoy one.     Final thoughts - at $9-13 a bottle the price is quite high but the 9% abv will make sure you don't need more than two unless you're sharing with a friend or few

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Appearance - This beer pours almost a black color but the edges appear redish brown in direct light. It pours a 3 aad a half finger foamy off white head that just does not fade. Carbonation is extremely lively and very visible.    Aroma - The first smells to hit your nose are dark fruits, plum, raisin and fig are all there. Then you get a soft slightly burnt caramel undertone followed by spice and fresh baked white bread.    Taste - Again fig, raisin and plum hit the tongue first followed by a medicinal phenolic taste. then you get burnt caramel and toffee followed by pepper and fresh baked bread. Apon swallowing you get a strong boozy warmth.     Feel - medium-light body with carbonation that tingles and is creamy at the same time, a boozy warmth finishes off this feeling.     Overall - This is a very good Belgian dark ale. As far as trappist ales go I've had some blondes and tripels that surpass it in my tastes. I prefer light fruits to dark fruits though, With that said this has to be up there with rochefort 8 as one of the better strong dark ales. The flavors mesh very well and It is rather smooth. I just feel like they could have hidden the boozyness better. Either way I guess this way it makes for a better winter beer to come home to on a cold day. Cheers!

The beer is a hazy yellowish-brown of moderate depth.     The aroma is bready, earthy, fruity and minerally. The flavor has a distinct maltiness, suggesting a gingerbread cookie. Also apparent is a spicy apple-raisin fruitiness, and a lemony tartness on the finish. A peppery bit of spice and pucker punctuate the flavor, while a light earthy funk underlies it all. A little boozy warming is apparent, and perhaps a touch of spicy alcohol bite. Vinous, port-like notes and dark fruit hints become more pronounced as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is frothier than one might expect.     This is obviously a world class beer worthy of its reputation. I'm on a bit of a Belgian kick at the moment (this style becoming more available in my area), and am enjoying this and other Belgian beers very much this Thanksgiving weekend.

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 A: [4.00] There is staggering 3 fingers of eggshell colored head. The head looks fairly dense and very creamy. The head is covering a mahogany colored beer. The cork lists the vintage as 2014 and the bottle lists the ABV (9.0%).    S: [3.25] The dense head is making it hard to get an initial nose. The nose seems subdued. I am getting caramel and red wine esters.    T: [4.00] The taste follows the nose with a nice rich caramel taste. This beer has a really solid malt build that gives some toast flavors in the middle. On a few sips I thought I got an off rust flavor. My favorite flavor is the one that is NOT there. I really do not like Belgian yeast. This beer has none of the Belgian yeast flavor.    M: [4.00] Nice carbonation. Slick mouthfeel, maybe a tad on the watery side though. There is no sense of the 9% ABV.    O: [3.75] This bottle has aged for almost a year. I have never had the beer fresh - but this is really good. The primary flavor is a caramel that is very appealing. As mentioned above there is no flavor of Belgian yeast (which I dislike). I left this bottle for a long time for fear of the disappointment of Belgian yeast. I find this to be a really enjoyable beer.

S- Nutty and earthy. Dark Fruit making a presence as well (raisin, prune, etc)     T- Dark fruit and christmas spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, etc) as well as a slight booziness. Despite the label's prescribed drinking temperature of 12 degrees Celsius, I poured the beer straight from my fridge which is just around 2 degrees C. I noticed that the boozy character thinned out as the beer warmed and more dark fruit came through. I definitely recommend that you let this one warm (to about 12 C) before consuming.     M- Medium body and moderate carbonation. I noticed fine bubbles clinging to the bottom sides of the glass which is something I seldom see in a beer. Neat!     O- At last, an additional world class Trappist Brewery makes it's debut in my Province (the first was La Trappe)! As soon as a saw a shelf of Chimay Blue, I jumped at the chance (despite the high asking price of $6 CAD per 330 mL bottle) and I have to say that I was not disappointed in the least. What a beautifully executed Belgian brew.

But this head stays for a good long time.  S - Maybe my sniffer is not working today, but this beer has almost no aroma at all.  T - Tastes of dark fruits (muted) and a little bready. Slight alcohol kick. Some sweetness comes in on the finish.  M - Medium body and carbonation.  O - If you are new to this beer, don't drink it cold. Let it warm to almost room temp to get all the flavors. This is a difficult beer to identify because the flavors do not hit you over the head. But it is wonderful, one of the best of the Belgians.

Bottle looks pretty cheap. Not expecting much...    Dark, deep, lingering foam...    Aroma is natural, deep and inviting. Though a little too carbon dioxidey (in case you are foreign, that is not a word, I just created it...)    Very flavoursome and highly drinkable, for 9%. Reminds me of Christmas, even though it is October. Bitter, citrussy, loving it. Definitely going to be drinking more of this. Unfortunately not tonight as my supermarket closes in 8 minutes and I live on the 7th floor with no lift, typical hardcore parisian style.    Very good feel, it really zings in your mouth and the bubbles themselves have flavour.    This beer is pretty cheap in Paris, and the best I have had so far that they sell locally. Will have to be careful as it probably will not mix too well with my current 7th floor no lift parisian style    After 8 months in Paris, I would add that this beer is variable, sometimes it really is not that good, and recently it's taste has massively reduced in my experience. So I am downgrading the ratings...

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 This is a beautiful beer. Pours a semi-opaque brown with an amber tint. The head is big, foamy and beige/off-white. The nose is very reminiscent of a mash tun. Lots of sweet malt smell with some sweet fruit notes (like baked apples) and that unmistakeable smell of wort. The taste is just a bit of hops in the front but the sweet malt follows quickly and covers any bitterness until the dry finish that carries a few of the burnt notes. Mouth is very smooth and full-bodied but keeps a dry and light finish. A really great BSDA.

It's one of this beer that you drink as a good wind. It's complex. It's a lot about the yeast and the grain and it's great

Good retention; speckled lacing. (4)	    S:	  Dark bread and spices. Berries, leather, rubbery phenols, cloves/cinnamon. (4)	    T:	  Dark fruits and dough. Slightly sweet with a woody/hard water taste underlying it all, lots of dark dough, light pepper, dark fruits. (4.25)	    M:	  Rich, medium-full bodied, with soft carbonation and a smooth finish, well-hidden alcohol, pretty drinkable. (4.5)	    O:	  Great beer, a classic strong dark ale.   Very lively yeast flavors with layered fruitiness and breadiness. Rich and creamy feel with a smooth, clean finish. Roses, cherries, brandy and cream. The booze is there and there is the slightest garden hose quality to it, but it is a very good beer on the whole. Absolutely will have again. As I already said, it's a classic. (4.5)

This amazing trappist beer has a dark brown color, looking like ice tea to me and has a medium head with good carbonation. It says on the 330 ml bottle that the best serving temperature is between 10°C - 12°C, means that a fridge would be way too cold for this brew!  I smelled dark fruits, raisins and chocolate. Amazing mouthfeel. The 9% ABV is perfectly hidden. Im sure I could drink a lot of these without any problem :) Really, an amazing beer, little pricey but probably the best on this planet!

Pours murky brown/gray with a medium head and lots of carbonation. Head stands up, supported by the effervescence. Smell is classic Belgian Strong Dark -- musty, dark overripe fruits, dates. And yeast.    Taste is strong in the date department, moderately sweet (but not as sweet as I was afraid), some kind of sour flavor I can't readily identify.    Mouthfeel is nice -- thick, chewy, not sticky, not heavy (yeah I know, thick and chewy but not heavy -- not sure how to describe the sensation). Overall, solid beer. Love that it's readily available. Surprised I've gone this long without reviewing it.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 33cl bottle purchased at Brussels grocery store.  BB: 12/2020  Served chilled in a Delirium tulip.    Pours very dark brown with tan head. Smells mainly of roasted dark malts and like a solven...sort of like varnish (?!).    Taste is full, hefty, malty. Alcohol is well masked. At 9%, big kudos on that!   There is some sweetness on the tongue, but not as much as others here that reach this ABV.   I like this one much more than the Chimay Red.   
look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Look: As perfect as the Trappistes Rochefort 8, which is also a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. While this body doesn't make a transition from ruby to amber, it still has a dark amber body with a reddish brown lower-end and a light brown head. Moreover, thanks to the carbonation, the head retention is perfect.    Smell: I could smell some hints of roasted, but not smoked, hops. You can sense the smooth bitterness.    Taste: Despite its high ABV, I didn't taste the alcohol, which is a good sign. The beer has a bouquet flavours which encompasses black currants, honey, caramel and roasted hops. There were also some hints of coffee at the back end.    Feel: The beer is not as creamy as Trappistes Rochefort 8 is on our palate. However, it is an easy drinking beer with a sublime taste.    Overall: This is the best beer from Chimay. It is the total package given its nice body and palate. The flavours manifested themselves individually when you know how to drink it slowly.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 A- This beauty pours a dark cola color that is somewhat hazy and with a caramel colored head that starts about one finger thick and settles to a nice thick film over the beer. I cannot tell what the carbonation looks like in the murkiness but I can tell you all that the lacing of this one is subdued and the foam quickly slides back into the glass. Not bad overall!    S- Toffee, caramel, blackstrap molasses, dark maple and cooked brown sugar probably round out the initial aroma profile. Dark fruits like plum, raisin, fig are present and there are notes of dark chocolate and some muted coffee tones as well....very balanced smelling Ale for sure!    T- This is dark and delicate overall.....flavors follow suit to the aromas quite well, with the dark fruits taking over initially but the chocolate and coffee tones are quite noticeable.....the sweetness found in the aromas sharpens into a deeper darker suculent version of themselves....the toffee and molasses is much more noticed! The finish is somewhat dry and of Earthy spices....awesome!    M/O- The carbonation of this one really explodes well on the palate, allowing the full spectrum of the complex flavors to show themselves individually. The body is medium/full and the rich balanced nature of this one is something to sit back and think about! The high alcohol content is a non factor and this is quite drinkable so I would imagine this could creep up on a person rather quickly! A champagne of Trappist beers is what this is!

IMO this beer is way overrated as i have had better tasting belgians than this. Smell- yeast, soil, dried raisins, leather,brown sugar, malt.  Taste- fizzy. Moderate carbonation. bitter alcohol, malt, yeast. No sweet aftertaste. Surprisingly an easy beer to drink at this ABV. Dry and yeasty. Strong Dark murky ale that makes you almost taste murky monk's underground cellars.

Taste - dark fruits, raisins, belgian yeasts, spicy hues. Rich, delightful and warming.    Grande reserve 2012 (brewed to honour 150th birthday of Chimay). In comparison with newer Chimay blue head retention is not so long,    Grande Reserve 2010. Head and retention are less than for newer. Aging characters are sharper, more chocolate and stale tones. Beer degradation comparatively with 2012 is very intense.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a tulip.    A - Pours a very dark brown, billowy white head.    S - Plums, elderberries, caramel, soil.    T - Fruity esters explode from the front of the palate, with notes of banana and stone fruit. A rich, caramelly malt sweetness catches up quickly, along with a robust floral flavor from the hops. The esters evolve into whirlwind of dry fruit and spice until it ultimately dominates with a dry residual spiciness.    M - Medium-full body, moderate carbonation.    O - Incredibly complex and robust. Definitely drier and more bitter than other beers I've had in the style, but nonetheless a great brew.

Tastes like honey and plums with flowery notes and maybe some spiciness like cloves. The carbonation stings the tongue slightly but is not too much. It has a medium body and a nice slightly sweet slightly bitter finish that lingers until the next sip. Hard to tell this beer is 9% with the excellent balance of maltiness and bitterness.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 This was poured into a chalice.  The appearance was a fairly dark brown color with some light amber hues along the sides of the glass. The head was white with about two fingers thick of level foaminess. Lacing runs down in thick foamy strings.  The smell had some light Belgian spices, brown sugar, figs, raisins and some remnants of light cooked apple.  The taste combined the sweet with the spice through the previously mentioned flavors. A lingering fruity sweet to lightly spiced aftertaste runs into the finish.  The mouthfeel has a medium body with a good sipping quality about it. Carbonation seemed good - becoming slightly smooth.  Overall, this is a classic for a reason. Its a standard for the style.

I get a waft of gingerbread, anise and clove. Gorgeous beer, served as an introduction to Belgian beer and its storied tradition, almost 5 years ago. Smoothness and richness cannot be understated. Complexity reveals itself further upon warming. Stone cold classic.

look: 5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2 | feel: 3 | overall: 2 BOOOOOOOOO    one of the most fantastically over rated beers of all time    the main point I want to stress here is that this beer is overwhelmed by its astringency it's just not that good, sorry. it tastes like what I would imagine a store brand trappist would taste like. It is not that interesting, and if it is complex, it is not enjoyable enough to justify savoring or investigation. I have given this beer chance after chance after chance, IMO the only thing it is good for is cooking. I love belgian beer and I hate this ale sooooooo very much 2 thumbs down and downright unpleasant

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Pours two fingers of mocha foam. Dark opaque brown colour, have to hold it up to the light to see the dark ruby Amber colours. Looks handsome.     First scent is grape juice and figs and hints of burnt brown sugar. Fruit scents are really bursting here. Smells like it's going to be sweet.    Taste is richer than the scent, bright fruit juices turn to dried fruits like prunes and dates and Thompson raisins. Baking spices for a rum cake roll over the tongue. Reminds me of traditional German Christmas desserts Kompot and Stollen. Finish is booze burnt caramel, and I may detect a little bitterness for half a second.     Quite a bit of carbonation on the tongue with a fairly thick juicy feel to it.     Overall it's incredibly rich and full bodied, more so than the red, with smother and more well rounded fruit flavours that are expected in this type of Trappist ale but oft not as well executed. Simply great and the sweet ness which I can often find overbearing is nicely checked throughout.

Smell is that of sweet fruitcake, minimal alcohol like vodka. Mouthfeel is moderate, carbonated and a bit chewy. Taste is perhaps one of the most complex of beers I have experienced. Toffee, fruitcake, cinnamon, nutmeg, mole negro, milk chocolate, cardamom, with a lasting aftertaste of piney, resiny hops and yeast esters.

Mothfeel is dry with an alcohol heaviness with heavy carbonation and charred finish.    Overall, it's a solid Belgian.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A really great beer. Malty but not too sweet. Complex spicy flavors. Doesn't quite knock my socks off like Trappistes Rochefort 10 but overall fantastic.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 330ml bottle into goblet. about a year old i think    a: dark-ish mahogany with a nice glow when held up to the light. a finger of bubbly tan head. lots of suspended yeast    s: nice raisin and fig notes, backed by a very pleasant caramel-y/bready malty sweetness    t: not-too-strong sweet dark fruits (raisins, meaty figs) that intermingle with the dominant bready brown sugary malt sweetness all the way from start to finish. what i like a lot is the constant mild-to-moderate bitterness that balances everything out. the dark fruit flavours emerge a bit more as the beer warms    m: at a year old, i think the carbonation has tamed a good amount. medium mouthfeel    o: probably my favourite BSDA, and is ridiculously well-priced at the LCBO at $3.35/330ml. incredibly balanced and always a pleasure to drink. in general, i have issues with young yeasty belgian ale carbonation, so one year of age on this one seems to be perfect for me   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Serving: 33 cL bottled (marked "L14-172") poured into a stemmed Pilsner (beer tulip) glass.    Appearance: Hazy copper brown with a light khaki head of soft, thick foam. Spare lacing and a fringe of foam persist.    Smell: Roasted grains, dark fruit (raisins, dates), spice and hints of alcohol.    Taste: Full, roasted malt body; dark fruit, earth, vanilla, tobacco and slight bitterness. Finishes relatively crisp and dry.    Mouthfeel: Medium body with relatively lively carbonation giving an airy, creamy feel.    Overall: Somewhat restrained next to New World peers, but still tasty, well balanced and smooth without any hint of its ABV.

A must-try for every craft enthusiast.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Had this from a bottle in Shanghai. I was glad to find some quality over there. It pours a very dark reddish brown with a thick, tannish head. Very nice lacing throughout the drink. The aroma is malty with definite fruity undertones. The taste is exceptional even for a Trappist ale. It starts with a sweet maltiness that has real grapey undertones. The taste ends with an alcohol hit that is ameliorated by the fruitiness. It feels almost perfect in the mouth with some real body, nice carbonation, and a lingering taste of fruit. I rate this down a little in drinkability just because of the alcohol content. It is drinkable from first drop to last.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A - The body is dark brown, with an orange cast, semi-opaque, and a orange-tan head that forms huge but fades quickly to a short foamy cap. Not much lacing, but the head has legs.    S - A strong front of pears and apples, a hint of orange, grape must, and cherry. Spices include allspice and clove.    T - The fruit opens, with baked apples and poached pears, stone fruits, and raisins the main elements. The middle turns to doughy goodness, a baked confection of spice and bread, with a hint of citrus. The close dries some, still sweet but with a steeped tea note as balance.    M - Moderate carbonation and mild drying keep this from becoming cloying, but the beer is a serious, somewhat heavy affair.    O - The various flavors and counterpoints make for an exceptional Belgian, powerful and full, but balanced and pleasurable. It is one of the best BSDAs I've had the pleasure of consuming.

Beautiful 2 finger head that leaves incredible lacing on the side of the glass.    Smell: Soft notes of plum, sweet date, molasses, and dark corn syrup along with notes of banana, clove, and plum.    Taste: Yeast notes really shine in this one- the darker fruity notes mentioned in the smell are really quite assertive here. Dates, plum, banana, and clove seem to dominate the flavor and it's all glued together by a nice caramel/molasses touch. Magnificent balance and drinkability for an otherwise strong beer.    Mouthfeel: Silky on the tongue, but stronger carbonation than I expected.    Overall: A great beer, no doubt, but honestly, one that seems to be hyped up a bit. For a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, several Unibroue beers seem to compete strongly against this and might even edge it out, especially Trois Pistoles. Nonetheless, an awesome beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 1 pint 9.4 ounce cork and caged bottle, there is a 2013 mark on the cork.    APPEARANCE: pours a cloudy, sediment filled brown color with a two-finger tan head, higher than average carbonation and excellent retention, there was a thin, unbroken layer of bubbles that remained for quite a while, very little lacing on the glass.    SMELL: sweet caramel, dark fruit like plum or raisin, bread, I could smell the alcohol.    TASTE: very sweet up front, dark fruit, bread, then a very pleasant alcohol burn, not overpowering but it's there, I would say the 9% ABV is well disguised, the taste really lingers in a good way with an alcohol warming effect.    PALATE: creamy, very high carbonation.    OVERALL: this is one of my favorite beers, love to have it on special occasions a couple times a year, it's kinda pricey at $16.00 but it all goes to charity so it's no problem.

Feel medium or light medium body with heavy carbonation. Leaves you wanting another drink.  Overall I tried rochefort 10 a while back and didn't care for it. I'm glad I didn't give up on the style this beer is great.   
look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Sweet and fizzy are the two words that come immediately to mind. Some bitterness at the close. Pretty complex all and all. Will schedule a future tasting to more adequately assess / discuss. It does hide the 9.00% very well. All and all though, one I can/would/will likely drink again. Lacing of tiny bubbles absolutely amazing in this one, whenever the glass was tilted or tipped, a cascade of bubbles would slowly trickle down the side of the glass.
