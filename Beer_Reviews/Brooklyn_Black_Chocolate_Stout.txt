Enjoyable bittersweet dark chocolate and heavy roast, a lovely appearance with great retained lacing from an aggressive pour, but a touch of acrid bitterness that takes the roasted notes a slight touch farther than I would prefer.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Winter 2018 bottling    Pours a light black with no translucence and a fluffy cap of caramel-colored foam; nice retention on the head with some sparse walls and stringy patterns of thicker lacing left around the glass.    Aromas of dark cacao nibs and roasty malts dominate; lighter hints of caramel, toffee, and milk chocolate influence the bouquet smoothly in the background.    Taste of dark chocolate and toasted granola upfront, with lighter tones of dark berries/stone fruits, smooth malty roast, and a faint milk chocolate imparting the slightest sweetness toward the finish; bits of booze are somewhat prevalent on the latter part of the profile.    Mouthfeel shows a nice medium body, slightly sticky, and with lower levels of carbonation with an occasional odd spike; hints of booze come through on occasion, but not enough to become a consistent distraction; a well incorporated package of sweet, dry, and roasty.    Integration of dark chocolate really evens out the expected stone fruit and dark berry tones, striking a nice balance where plenty of lighter (mainly sweeter) notes are given space to shine through. I do think this didn’t quite reach the next level, though, as the profile was muddied in spots, and the mouthfeel suffered from the occasional thinness and inconsistency. Overall a really solid brew that does shine in its approachable flavor and drinkability.

As for the aroma...it has mellowed some, but yet it still has the hint of the roasted malts, chocolate & slight coffee to it along with the ABV a lil' more pronounced.  The taste in your face ABV with the chocolates, malts, & coffee along for the ride, and what a ride to take...Well worth admission!!!  As for feel I fell it has mellowed with the ABV upfront, but that's me...it is smooth with some very slight dryness at the end, but very pleasant at the same time.  Either way you have this brew (cellared or fresh)...it is a win win, cellared or not...it delivers! Enjoy!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 The beer pours a deep black with a large brown head. The aroma is thick and powerful, with loads of dark chocolate, but also molasses, raisin, plum, licorice, burn caramel, and mocha. the flavor layers dark and milk chocolate throughout the sip with blackstrap molasses, rum soaked raisins, cedar, dried pine, hickory, burnt meat ends, caramel, licorice, and just a hint of orange peel. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with aggressive carbonation and a dry finish. Overall a masterpiece that reminds me of the power and intensity of a classic imperial stout, not sweet finish, not flavorings, just solid beer all the way through.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 A solid offering from Brooklyn. Aroma was mostly coffee followed by roasted malt and chocolate.  Taste was bitter black coffee upfront followed by bitter dark chocolate. Roasted malt added flavor and the high abv did add to the o erall flavor as well but made it a little rough around d the edges  Worthy of a try but not going to compete for world class yet but that's ok,still a solid beer   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured a 12 ounce bottle with a smudged date (bought it at a grocery store so it was probably fresh) into an Abbey long stemmed tulip. Color was dark impenetrable brown with a sizable tan head that stuck around for a while. Smell was increasingly chocolatey as it warmed up with a charred malt base. Taste mirrored the smell with minimum alcohol presence. Mouthfeel was fine.    This got mentioned in Vintage Beer as a good candidate for aging so I already have another to cellar and it's not very expensive so maybe I'll snag a couple others.

Appearance- a deep black in the body, but a little clearing at the bottom and the head, similar to cola; head is merely a thin mocha ring around the edge and lacing is absent.  Smell- dark chocolate, brownie batter and dark roasted coffee!  Taste - dark roasted, malty coffee is most profound in the flavor profile, with hints of soy sauce and the dark chocolate making a brief cameo!  Feel - definitely a sipper, but a fairly easy one at that; smooth with some dark chocolate and coffee bitterness!  Overall- all in all this is great, it just lacks the character to stand amongst the best in the category; a very good RIS that I would certainly recommend if you haven’t tried!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 2015 vintage score...thanks John at Twin-Lo! Poured moderately hard to a tulip glass at room temp. Dark black color, with a nice 1/2” mocha head. Tons of heavy lacing just grips the glass and doesn’t fall. Nose is all dark chocolate, with a slight smokey char aroma. First sips follow the nose, with a bit of dark pit fruit. I’ve had this fresher, and this seems like it got hotter with age! Not overly boozy, but unexpected compared to the way the ABV usually hides. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying. Always a stable stout, aging brings some subtle differences. Another 4 cellaring!

Now this rarely happens but it's happening here folks, the 10% abv is not well hidden as compared to other RIS. Oh! it's going to lose a point or 2 for that. Cheers! B

Black colored body, with very dark highlights when presented to light. Persistent tan cap. Some spots of lacing.  Aroma is roasty and toasty malts, with a little dark chocolate. A touch of toffee.  Taste is mostly dark chocolate, with oak and tannins. A little soy and vanilla.  Super smooth mouth feel, somewhat dry.  A very easy sipping higher ABV stout, with very tasty chocolate taste, along with others that blend in well. Somewhat sweet as a dessert beer, but would fare well in conjunction with red meat and strong cheese.

Smell: Surprisingly little smell to this; I'd expected a wallop of chocolate, hops, and malted barley, especially given the brewery's description. Despite the high ABV, you don't get a strong whiff of alcohol off of this.  Taste: My, oh, my, is that nice! Chocolate predominates, as one would expect, but the malt and hops come through subtly afterwards.  Feel: Very nice body to this beer. Not too "thick" feeling as some stouts are.     A friend of mine has raved about Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout for years. Now, I can see why.

There is also a decent amount of lacing to this brew,it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with roasted grains and malts, sweetness from the chocolate. There is also a nice bite from the hops . Overall I nice looking and smelling brew, really inviting. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first pick up on the bold roasted grains and malts. The chocolate is a nice touch to this brew. I can't get over how smooth this brew goes down, it is really hard to pick up on the 10.00% ABV in this brew. There is nothing overpowering about this Russian Imperial Stout, it has a super nice balance to it. Overall I'm giving Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout a 4.50 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Brooklyn Brewery, did a real nice job with this brew.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Utterly black, thick body with a dark brown head whose fizziness and lingering lace bespeaks high alpha acid content. The nose hits hard with robust charred malts, rich, sweet, almost artificial chocolateyness, a touch of smoke, and a bite that further suggests healthy hopping. The flavor is potent with roasty malts and char, dark and bitter chocolate, and some appreciable piney hop resin. The alcohol seems to enhance the bitterness doled out by both the malt and the hops, but itself remains hidden. The body is nicely thick and mouth-coating, and the carbonation is fine and lively without becoming bubbly and fizzy.  Wow, what a great beer just sitting around. It brought the potency, it brought big, deep, rich flavor, it brought chocolate but didn't overdo it, and even managed to squeeze in some hops for the ride. Very happy right now.

I've had some success with these Brooklyn offerings and this stout turns out to be no different. As advertised, the damn thing is black, maybe even blacker than black. When I poured it into a Guinness glass, it even looked like a Guinness - black liquid, dark tan foam, and some good staying power. The smell was an even mix of booze and chocolate, but that did not translate to the taste. Try as I might, all I could really pull out was the boozy character of the beer - I liked it, but I was expecting something more balanced. Mouthfeel, after it warmed, was slightly creamy and a tad smooth, but first out of the bottle it was quite carbonated. I liked liked this one and would certainly reach for it again during this "cold" FLA winters...

A distinct note of soy lingers on the palate, leading to a slightly astringent finish. A bit austere and one-dimensional. [12 oz. bottle into snifter]

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottled 38 days ago poured into a snifter at fridge temp 10% ABV. The beer pours dense very dark brown with no light penetration. The head is light brown and slow to settle leaving behind significant lacing. The aroma is roasted malt, chocolate and coffee with no one dominant. The taste is smooth dark malt with dark chocolate undertones. The second half of the taste is roasty bitterness with a slight booze presence. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and somewhat dry. Overall, great imperial stout. I love the balance and the fact that I enjoy this fresh instead of having to age several years like some other RIS. Recommended.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Let me begin by stating the obvious: this IS a good beer. Pours a dark chocolate with a 1/4”-1/2” tan head and a light lacing. Medium to light carbonation. Definitely an Imperial Stout. Russian Imperial Stout. This beer only gets better as it warms. Chocolate? Think sweet, bitter, and all the variables. Layered. Balanced. Alcohol is all there, but not overwhelming. Excellent with cheeses or charcuterie. Think Fall/Winter weather setting. I could not possibly drink more than one in a sitting: or could I ??? I could.  10.0 % ABV  Note: did I underrate this beer?

An enjoyable drink but maybe one that I should have sat on for a while.

I don't know if its from the yeast, hops, or the malt.

I keep saying it and will continue to say it: An Imperial Stout should NOT be a hop bomb. I wish certain breweries would take note.    I love the motor oil black color. Aroma is pleasant... coffee, leather, dark chocolate - but not overpowering. The flavor is very good, rather similar to the aroma. It is also sufficiently carbonated, unlike certain stouts that taste flat, seemingly by design.    A fine stout that I won't hesitate to get again. Now, if only Brooklyn would bring back their Monster barleywine....   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours black as night, with a dark tan head that lingers for a minute. Has a rich smell of roasty espresso and alcohol, which the taste confirms, but once the (not unpleasant) alcohol taste goes you are left with the amazing flavor of rich dark chocolate that lingers on and on in the most satisfying way. It's like taking a bite out of a dark chocolate bar. So good.

It's not just a cold weather beer for me. Look is jet black luscious viscous oil. Hold it to a light , the light is barely seen if at all. Smell is espresso and dark chocolate malt. Taste is toasted espresso with chocolate in backround. The high abv is masked by a dark toasted malt that would have you believe that chocolate bean was brewed with this but it's not. Continues to be the best east coast imperial style stout IMO.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 OMFG! How is it possible that a) I have NEVER previously reviewed this beer & b) it will be my 4,400th on this site?!? I remember sharing a then-vintage bottle with Garrett Oliver & FerMentor Lew Bryson at the State College Beer Expo in 2000(?)/2001(?). I LOVE Brooklyn Brewery & I have visited many times over. I am flabbergasted that I have not reviewed this beer until now.     From the bottle: "This is the famous Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. Descended from the Russian Imperial Stouts of 18th Century, our Black Chocolate Stout has itself become a modern classic, heralded the world over. A blend of six malts produces its dark chocolate aroma and flavor. There is nothing better to enjoy with rich desserts, fine cheeses, and roaring fireplaces."; "The Legendary Russian Imperial Stout".     Today is T, 20 June 2017.     Winter 2016: I Pop!ped the cap & commenced a slow, gentle pour into an awaiting glass. Once decanted, a vigorous in-glass swirl raised a finger of dense, deep-tan/light-brown head with moderate retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled less like chocolate candy and more like fudge brownies. It was very rich and chocolaty, but also with a breadiness from the malt. Mouthfeel was big and full, like a scoop or dollop on my tongue. I let it lay there & rolled it around to better get a sense of its flavors. Interestingly, it not only had the rich chocolaty fudginess that I noted on the nose, but it also tasted of cherries, raisins, tobacco & charcoal smoke. Phew! Another no-playin'-around beer. Finish was dry, not sweet at all, with lingering cherry-chocolate flavors, like a torte.    Next, on W, 21 June 2017:    "Limited Bottling - Winter '14 - '15": I Pop!ped the cap & performed a very gentle pour. The in-glass swirl raised a brief finger of foamy, deep-tan/light-brown head with modest retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose was really rich with a fudgy, chocolaty, brownie-like quality, underlain by a light smokiness and a malty breadiness. Mouthfeel was somewhat lighter than in the more recent batch. It was not as thick or chewy, but it was still bigger than simply "medium-bodied". The taste was MUCH more chocolaty without any of the fruity flavors noted earlier. It was like a rich, fudgy brownie at this point, almost a dessert beer, although a smokiness kept it in check. Finish was dry which I might have thought unexpected had I not noted such in the fresher batch.     "Limited Bottling - Winter '12 - '13"; "In the last century, British brewers made strong stouts for the Czar's Court. They were called Imperial Stouts. Our Black Chocolate Stout, brewed once yearly for the winter season, achieves a chocolate aroma and flavor through the artful blending of six varieties of black, chocolate and roasted malts."    Having Pop!ped the cap & conducted a gentle pour, the in-glass swirl raised a brief finger of foamy, dark-tan/light-brown head with modest retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose had begun to take on a pronounced smokiness, more roasty than chocolaty. Mouthfeel continued to moderate, becoming less thick & chewy with each older iteration. The taste was more like raw baker's chocolate now, nary a hint of sweetness, but with a smoky, charcoal bitterness. Finish was quite dry at this point.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 It poured a pitch black leaving the same color body. A one inch foamy yet level dark tan head appeared and lasted for a good two minutes before dieing into the body of my nonic. Some nice foamy and clingy lacing appeared in rings. The smell had dark chocolate up front coming forth in a roasty sort of way. Some coffee notes presented themselves as the beer warmed. The taste was sweet and bitter in different aspects at different times as the chocolate comes and goes and the coffee comes and goes. The palate was about a medium with a nice smoothness coating the mouth and tongue. I’d say the drinkability isn’t that high, but hey for a RIS, this should be more of a sipper anyways as it shows with a fairly high ABV. Overall, this was a nice winter sipper that I would gladly come back to.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Saw it and had to try it.    Look- Dark cola brown, almost black. The head is dark tan and very thin. Not what I would call true lacing, just a slight syrupy residue that settles after a moment and is gone.    Smell - An above review mentioned soy sauce, and I think that fits. Just a hint of chocolate.    Taste- Chocolate, a bit of smoke and then the alcohol in good balance. Not too bitter. Just a tIny bit sweet.     Feel- Light/medium body . Swallow is very smooth. Aftertaste is that of slightly chalky, mildly bitter cocoa.    Overall- I generally prefer my Stouts dry, and this one pleased me. The little bit of sweetness was what this one needed. I recommend it as a nightcap, because the alcohol hits you fast. I would buy it again. Generally, I like to suggest food pairings in my reviews, but this beer probably is best unaccompanied. It is also better at room temperature.

Pours Black with a brown head. Aroma is a mix of blueberries/strawberries/blackberries/raspberries - and some dark chocolate. Taste is nutty/berry/dark chocolatey dream. Feel is light, silky and smooth. There are some slight boozey notes in both the taste and aroma Overall, I've found that aging this beer definitely brings out its finer qualities. Aged for a year.. and you get more of the dark chocolate profile. Aged for two years and you get the fruitier profile. Definitely age a 4 pack and see what happens. Interesting to see what another year or two will do, although that might be pushing it.

I think generally don't like stouts unless they have some other extra taste, such as the Dragon's Milk with the bourbon and vanilla flavors. The chocolate came through on this one but the roast/burnt flavor still dominated too much for me. The mouthfeel was a little thin as well for my tastes.

Nice smooth roasted malts with some oaky notes with some hoppy bitterness on the finish.     Feel is medium to full bodied. Medium carbonation. Mild bitterness leaves a slightly dry finish.     Overall a really well done Russian Imperial Stout. Always a joy to drink.

On the nose chocolate, malt and subtle yeast. Full mouthfeel up front and through the middle with slight heat on on the back. Too drinkable, IMEHO.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a dark, dark brown, with low foam, and a bit of lacing.    Loads of chocolate on the nose, with hints of raisins and roasted coffee. Tiny bits of booze also seep through.    The first thing you taste is dark chocolate, and lots of it. In between layers of the chocolate, you find tones of coffee and licorice. Long finish with quite a bit of roasted malt.    Soft liquid, just the right amount of carbonation. Mayve a little bit thin.    Overall, a good stout, at a price that is hard to beat. My only gripe is that is's a little bit too thin.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Beautiful pour, yielding a black chocolate color and a slightly reddish beige head. Head forms 1 finger and gradually recedes to a ring of lace.     Notes of roast malts, peppery coffee, chocolate, and cocoa.     Alcohol is apparent right from the get-go. It's a pleasant burning flavor without acridity or astringency. Lovely notes of chocolate and roast malts dance on and around the palate. Some tight licorice snap on the finish. As it warms up a few degrees the alcohol presence does become a touch astringent. Still, it's one of the better tasting Russian Imperial Stouts I've had.     Feel is pretty roasty as well, with hot, boozy alcohol dryness and burn. A dry, dry finish.     Overall the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is a solid performer. It's got all the chocolate and roast notes, with only a hint of unfavorable astringency. One of my top favorite RIS's for sure.

look: 3 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of a tan color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of roasted malt, slight sweet malt, slight licorice, alcohol, slight dark citrus, and slight yeast. Fits the style of a Russian Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight roasted bitterness and a pleasant warmth. Tastes of strong sweet malt, roasted malt, strong alcohol, yeast, dark citrus, hint of licorice, hint of pale malt, and slight biscuit. Overall, weak appearance, but good aroma, body, blend, and complexity.

As I had 2016 vintage this week and the 2015 is much smoother, and really smooths out the rough edges.

Smell: A hefty, diverse array of dark fruit rises above the malt, which depicts the usual roasted mocha notes along with some malted milk. A smattering of allspice puts me in a holiday mood. In all, both promising and unexpected.     Taste: Akin to the aroma, the roastiness is at the bottom of this lasagna. It lasts well into the finish, however, lingering longer than the more upfront flavors. Chocolate soft serve ice cream is made heftier with a coat of cinammon and rich dark cherry and plum flavors. Some spicy hops and a taste of vanilla yogurt bring some balancing brightness to the complex, yet round configuration. Very well done!     Mouthfeel: Medium-high carbonation is on the front of each sip, but artfully melts into a smooth finish. Medium-bodied. It might benefit from some more heft, but the lightness of such a heavy hitter in terms of ABV in particular, is impressive. The high ABV is extra hidden in that no obvious alcohol warming comes through.     Overall: I may be a Brooklyn resident, but Brooklyn Brewery's beers are hit or miss for me. This one hits hard: Its unique and thoughtful recipe goes above and beyond your typical chocolate stout with its powerful helpings of fruit and spice. The details are finely tuned, but the big picture makes a solid impact. Disappointed that I bought a single bottle, as I'd love to have another right now!

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours pitch black with small 1 finger head. The aroma is dark roasted malt, cocoa, and just a little dark fruit. On the taste I mostly get a dry bitter dark chocolate with a good amount of dark malt. The roast really doesn't come through until the finish where it finishes bitter with a very nice warming. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I'd like, but it's still thick enough to coat the mouth. Overall this is a solid stout, not one of my favorites but I really enjoyed it and I can't wait to see how the other 3 cellar.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottle served just above fridge temperature and served into a tulip. Purchased while visiting the US.     Appearance - pours almost the darkest of dark blacks with a small half finger of tam head on top. Good head retention and the color eradicates light. Small cap of tan foam lingers for a good duration on top.    Smell - dark chocolate and some surprisingly cherry aroma too to add some complexity. Some mild earthiness with just a hint of vanilla and coffee on the nose, but sweetish on the nose with dark chocolate and cherry being the stars.    Taste - loads of dark chocolate, a prevalent but restrained bitterness. Some mild sweetness with a brief cherry intermission before a fine coffee ground flavor shines through as well. Complex with multiple levels of flavor there's even a coffee, vanilla and caramel troika to close. Yum. Enough other flavors to make me think this is an American stout as opposed to a Russian imperial stout.    Mouthfeel - smooth with a heavy but slick body, creamy feel and adequate carbonation. Just right for the style.    Overall - while Brooklyn's Dark Chocolate stout is not quite the pinnacle of the style, it is a delicious, flavourful stout loaded with dark chocolate and cherries that is certainly worth any beer advocates time. Highly recommended for this top notch brew.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 I love my imperial stouts and I also love Brooklyn, so I had to try this one. This is an amazing sipping beer and is not for your run of the mill beer drinker. I mostly like my beer like I like my coffee, nice and dark; so this is well within my wheel house. Overall the smell is spot one and second to none for an imperial stout. The taste is also very good and gives it a feel of drinking dark chocolate. Overall I am quite pleased with this Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout and will be partaking of it through out this fall and coming winter.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Poured a winter 15-16 bottling into a Nonic. Color was ink black with a full tan head with good retention. The aroma is of roasted malt and coffee. On the palate very minimal carbonation with a rich creamy mouthfeel with the flavor of coffee and dark chocolate with deep roasted malt and fruity back notes of plum and raisin. Bitter on the front end which gave way to a subtle but discernible sweet finish which became more prominent as the beer warmed while drinking. the high ABV does not come across as boozy but does make you take notice. Very good.

Almost perfectly black with a reasonable head retention which can easily be brought back to life with a gentle swirl of the glass releasing the gorgeous aromas anew. Had a bottle head to head with Founders Breakfast Stout. No clear winner but a slightly fuzzy head this morning!

The smell comes off a little boozy with lots of bready? flavor coming through no chocolate that I can detect though. The taste changes a lot as it warms starting out like a strong and good guinness-ish simple stout flavor. Ends up tasting deliciously chocolatey but not too much or fake at all imo. Overall one of my favorites also makes a damn good black flip if youre into cocktails at all

Na boca, sente-se um peso marcante, viscosidade que remete licor, sabot adocicado, amargor nao persistente.  Aftertasting fica o aroma e sabor, porem sutil, nao pesiste como esperado ao primeiro gole.

T: Intense bitter roast and cocoa powder up front. Stays on the tongue forever then eases into a long slightly sweeter finish. You breathe out the dark malt.   M: Silky smooth yet sticky for flavors.  O: More intense and noticeably better after a few years, but maybe pushing it a little with oxidation. A really delicious and alkaline stout; a nice departure from the sugar bombs nowadays. Pairs predictably well with artisan flavored chocolates.

Smell: Dark chocolate, baking cocoa, dark roast coffee, caramel, vanilla, burnt toast, and soy sauce.    Taste: More sweet than bitter, but balances nicely on the finish. You get toffee, caramel, milk chocolate, and dark roast coffee upfront. Toasted bread and a touch of butterscotch in the middle. Finishes with dates, figs, tobacco, black licorice, bitter cacao, and more coffee.    Feel: The lighter side of full-bodied, but feels silky and velvety in the mouth. Lightly carbonated.    Overall: A sweeter example of a Russian Imperial Stout, it lives up the "chocolate" name. A delicious dessert stout.

Smell: Roasty, boozy.    Taste: Nicely well rounded flavor, bitter chocolate, booze, roasted malt. Reminds me of 2012 Stone Imperial Russian Stout.    Feel: Coats the mouth.    Overall: Very enjoyable. It aged very well, I think.

The date on this bottle said:" LIMITED BOTTLING WINTER 11-12". It really can't get any better. A nice solid stout aged 4 years . When the bottle was popped open for a special occasion, I was in heaven !!! A nice black thin pour . Super smooth !   A semi-sweet chocolate with coffee and malt in the background like taste. The taste almost changes with each sip.  I am bummed out my glass is almost empty, but I have a few more in the basement ! I put this offering from Brooklyn right up there with Old Rasputin as two of the better Imperial Stouts for sure !!!   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Black, oily appearance with minimal head in the range of 1/5", beige. Aroma was chocolate, sticky, and some bourbon barrel.     Taste hit up lots of chocolate impressions coming from the malt moreso than an adjunct usage. Finished chalky and dry.     A good beer, but there are plenty of other options for spending $20 for a barrel aged stout, but its nice that this one usually sits on shelves.

Aroma is not overwhelmingly chocolate, but it's there among vanilla, roast, and slight booze. Flavor follows the nose well, and that's a good thing. Nice notes of dark cocoa, some sweetness in the middle, and a somewhat dry, slightly bitter finish. Will definitely have this again.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours black with a medium-thin foamy desert tan head. Fair retention. No lacing left behind. Roasted malts, chocolate, and alcohol on the nose.

It's pretty cool that they can make that flavor only with the malt.  Nice sweetness without being cloying. Finish is bit on the hoppy and bitter side.  Despite not having much visible carbonation, it feels light on the tongue.  Overall: Good stout!

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 We got a great beer here.  Listed in the "1001", I read that review that this recipe got Garrett Oliver his job at Brooklyn. (He had been working in a brewpub in Manhattan.) And beer history took a very big step.  Unlike many of the others in this category, Brooklyn's contribution uses no cocoa... but tastes like chocolate. You have to know lots about malts and, apparently in 1994, Garrett Oliver knew lots more than just about everyone.     I bought a 4 pack... which I no longer regret. Two years later, I just drank the last one now and it was worth holding as it clearly had improved... less edge, more smooth.    Reviewed in Roger Protz' " 300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"  MJ's 1999 edition gave this 3.5 stars of 4 and called it "the world's answer to a waring malted milk with a shot of bourbon. It achieves an astonishing black-chocolate flavour through malt alone"    2/5/17 had the vintage bottled two years ago. All the tastes are there, but not at peak. My next tasting of this will be at 18 months.

I had this out at a Freezepop(electro, synth pop)music show in a 12 ounce pilsner style glass.  Look: blackout, letting no light through at all.  smell: Not much smell, a small amount of roasty, bready smell, some chocolate  taste: sweet chocolate, coffee, roasty biterness. It was a bit too bitter for me and a kind of gluey aftertaste that I find in breakfast style stouts.  Feel: a tad heavier, but pretty o.k. for an imperial American stout.  Overall: The beer was not even close to what I am looking for in a stout. That weird aftertaste of glue and too charred and roasty for my tastes. I mean it didn't reach ash tray levels of burnt taste, but it wasn't very likeable for me. It wasn't absolutely horrible, just not great and not my thing. The one thing that I noticed was that it hides the alcohol taste very well. In that department they were good. I didn't know the ABV level before I bought the beer and only found out afterwards. I was quite surprised. I haven't normally liked Brooklyn Brewery in the past, but I figured I would give them another shot. Oh well.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 5 month old 12 oz bottle poured into generic belgian glass. I really like this beer. The pour is nice and dark and the brown head goes away fairly quickly. The sweet smell is not over powering. The taste is thin in the mouth but still full of the chocolate flavor. The positive flavor lingers for a bit as well. Is warm going down without being painfully hot. This is a very sold example of a sweet chocolate stout. Will get this again.

Creamy, full bodied mouthfeel. Alcohol emerges as beer warms but the 10% ABV is well hidden. Enjoyable beer overall, especially as "dessert" after a satisfying meal.

Moderate cocoa. Moderate caramel syrup.  T: Moderate roasty. Off-dry. Medium bitterness. A little hint of sourness.  M: Full body, very thick. Low carbonation.  O: A bit too thick and sweet. Chocolate/Nut character is underwhelming. Not bad, but I always expect richer ones for such high alcohol and gravity.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Truly one of the most delicious beers I have of this style. Unlike some "chocolate stouts" that resort to putting chocolate in their brew, Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout has no need to rely those techniques. It's amazingly rich and incredibly smooth despite its over the top nature. Very worth buying at 9 per 4 pack!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Brooklyn Brewery - Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. 10% ABV. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Bottled 9/30/15 at 12:01 (code 2735).    Look: Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights, and settles black as night. Large two finger tan head, that slowly lapses into a thick cap.    Smell: Rich dark chocolate, caramel, powdered sugar, and very faint alcohol.    Feel: Thick, chewy body, but very smooth with some nice carbonation.    Taste: Rich bitter chocolate is immediate, with some bitter coffee backing it. Has a sweet bitter chocolate aftertaste.    Overall: Nice sweet chocolate RIS, which conceals the ABV very well.

This RIS runs with a tough crowd and holds its own. Strong chocolate, licorice and expresso coffee come out in the finish. A full 10% ABV is well hidden, so be careful. We think of Brooklyn as in the upper mid-tier -- solid performers across the board -- but the one rises above the rest.

Tastes of semi sweet dark chocolate, some coffee and mild char. Touch of hop bitterness finishes it off. Alcohol very well hidden. Medium semi-slick mouthfeel. This is a good readily available stout, lots of chocolate goodness.

Quite a bit of lacing for a Russian Imperial Stout.     Smells of chocolate, caramel-sweetness, biscuits, and general smoked flavors.     A distinct bitter coffee-flavor dominates the taste. The roasted element comes through well in the initial taste, but ends up playing second fiddle to the coffee. I didn't get that much chocolate until the aftertaste, which has a distinct dark chocolate flavor that lingers for a delightfully long amount of time.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 | overall: 3 Some sort of screwy yellow code stamped on the bottle in very crude dot-matrix format - impossible to read. Grrrrr. Very dark, black, opaque. 1 inch tan, creamy, bubbly head that recedes slowly. Aroma is sweet, smoaky, chocolate. Moderately thick feel. Taste follows the aroma: sweet, roasty, bitter chocolate. Transitions from the opening taste through a sweet middle. The finish is bitter. Not boozy despite the high ABV. I can see how this would be highly rated by some, but somehow the sweet roasty fighting the bitter chololate does not work well for me. It is more like a "versus" than it is a balance. I enjoyed this beer as it stands, but it won't likely be a repeat purchase.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Poured into a snifter. Opaque black color accompanied with a 1.5 finger tan head that left quickly but left some nice tracks behind. The smell is semi-sweet chocolate, roasted malt, and dark bread. Rich chocolate taste with some coffee and roasted malt. A nice chocolate finish. Not a viscous as Ten Fidy, but full-bodied with a nice feel - perhaps a touch too thin. The alcohol is hidden well with a nice warming on the finish.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a pitch black color, thumbnail length dark tan head which dissipates to a thin ringlike lace.   This one is all about the chocolate. In the aroma I instantly detect dark bitter sweet chocolate. There is also coffee, roasted malt and a hint of wood. Towards the end, you smell the alcohol.  The taste is initially creamy sweet on the tongue, then, bitter dark chocolate, espresso, bitterness from hops, nutty. The finish is dry and the raw cacao bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. The alcohol warmth, front he high ABV, is there, however, it is by no means boozy.   Full bodied, rich, robust and viscous. It could be considered a sipper, but it is smooth enough that I felt that I drank it fast.  This might be arguably my favorite thus far from Brooklyn Brewery. It is complex and slightly intense, yet, a fairly drinkable stout.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 I love this beer. From the moment I opened it (knowing nothing about it) I knew I would.    Look: Black. The head is darker than most beers. A 1/4 inch layer on the bottom of the glass is totally opaque.    Smell: Baker's chocolate, heavy cream, coffee. Quite strong. I smelled it the moment I opened the bottle.    Taste: Dark chocolate, malt, cream/coffee.    Feel: Dense. Like drinking a slightly thin milkshake. The alcohol is present but only really felt if you hold it in your mouth. Sticks around too.    Overall: This beer is a smash hit for me. It hits every mark I look for in a stout, but is probably a little heavy to have more than 1 or 2 at a time.

T: Really rich with loads of caramel and bread. The roastiness is definitely more tame than with most imperial stouts, taking the form of sweet chocolate. Malty and toasty finish, with a hint of ethanol towards the end.     F: Very creamy feel, close to full body with moderate carbonation. Everything about the feel registers as rich, with the strength is very well hidden.    Overall: Very balanced RIS on the maltier side. Tasty, balanced, reliable.

Alcohol bite and tingly hop finish.    mf: Rich, creamy body with mild carbonation. Alcohol makes itself aware on in the mouth and throat.    o: Hard to imagine I have pasted this by all these years, given my love for imperial stouts. This is definitely for adults so kiddies beware! Black Chocolate Stout is rich, complex and very much a sipper. Drink at cellar temp.

Appearance: A one finger mocha head was poured that reduced to a thin layer. It is a pitch black color with no vision of anything. Super frothy lacing down the glass as the beer was drank.     Smell: Dark fruits, smoke, milk chocolate, molasses, caramel, roasted, toasted, and warm boozy alcohol.     Taste: Nice blend of above flavors. Creamy, silky, boozy, and slight ashy bitterness.    Mouthfeel: Super smooth, creamy, medium to full bodied, medium carbonation, ashy bitterness, medium to full bodied, and warm boozy alcohol.    Overall: Another beer I thought I reviewed. Had it so many times and many more in the future too.

Feel: Silky; creamy; smooth; Another that feels like a nitro.     Overall: A "big" beer that's exceedingly well done. Arguably the most enjoyable imperial I've had. Reminds me a bit of something like Weyerbacher's "Tiny," but with more mellowness and refinement. I've stockpiled a few for near-term drinking and a few for cellaring. Would make a great holiday / celebratory beer.

Need to get more while it's out

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 This winter stout pours to a thin, brief-lived sticky-looking creamy brown head on a nigh-impenetrable black body with slight orange highlights; lacing consists of the scantiest of ladders and dots. The nose leads with a surprisingly white toasted bread note, which vanishes to reveal a moderately-expressed dark maltiness: dominant chocolate notes sweetened by lesser amounts of molasses and dark, dark toffee, with very perceptible alcohol notes riding atop everything. On the palate, the toffee notes play a much stronger role than on the nose, obscuring the chocolate up front, then finding a synergistic balance with the chocolate by mid-palate, producing a slightly-sweet, beer-defining candy bar flavor. The finish is boozy and toffee-like, followed by a mild, moderately-roasted coffee bitterness that lingers for a few minutes. The mouthfeel is in keeping with the full body, and the texture is very creamy, peppery from the strong carbonation and quite warming from the alcohol. (12 oz bottle, 26 days after pkg.)   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 About 1 year old.    Body appears thin, little head retention. Less viscous than most RIS.  Smells of Sherry oxidation and cardboard.  Off dry, with oxidized flavours at the front. Somewhat pleasant, but a metallic I taste is prominent.    Hasn't aged well, it's past its prime.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This year's bottling into a snifter, slow pour resulting in little head dwindling to edge of glass lacing. Aroma is alcoholic, then chocolate, not much coffee. Improves with warming like most Russians. Taste is warm with the surge of the alcohol, which flees quickly to the dark chocolate and fruit of a stout. Feel begins with the carbonation but becomes smooth and sensuous. Lots of calories and a knockout alcohol level--go slow.

Bittersweet chocolate up front and at the finish, with dark fruit and roasted coffee in between. Creamy, smooth, viscous mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. Alcohol is quite well hidden. Overall, a little too much chocolate for my tastes - I might have to cellar the second bottle and see what it tastes like a year from now.

Pours a burnt chestnut mahogany and is completely black in the glass with a creamy khaki colored head of tightly packed, tiny bubbles. Great smell, lots of bittersweet chocolate, cocoa, fudge, dark fruits but with a faint tartness, something like blackberries and dark grape, charred caramel, vanilla, and rich malt. Great creamy, full mouth feel, no alcohol bite, goes down like silk. The bittersweet chocolate follows through strongly in the flavor, dark roasted coffee, vinous notes, licorice, molasses sweetness. This is truly one of the greats.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Bottle dated winter 2012-2013. Poured into a wine glass.    A- motor oil black with a half inch tan head that sticks around a long time. Not bad for almost three years old.    S- dark chocolate, with some alcohol and nutty complexity. A bit of stone fruit as well.    T- bitter dark chocolate balances some substantial sweetness. There's alcohol in here too, but it's not super evident. Roasted malt long into the finish.    F- smooth with some carbonation. Quite full, but short of syrupy. Just about right.    O- good at three years. Might hold up a touch longer, but with the oxidation already present, I wouldn't wait much longer

Overall - purchased the beer of a recommendation, overall it has lived up to the recommendation.

Lovely aromas of dark chocolate and lightly coffee coalesce into a remarkably balanced and rich taste with a creamy, velvety mouthfeel. I wouldn't call this an exciting Russian Imperial Stout by any means, but it's an excellent and balanced example of the style and might be the easiest to drink of any RIS I've had. Along with Northcoast's Old Rasputin, this would be an excellent introduction of the style.

The smell was amazing chocolate and vanilla. Even though it's not a bourbon stout I did sense a bourbon flavor but was also very hoppy at the same time. This was fantastic at an unbelievable price. Will purchase more of this in the late fall and defiantly age a few for several years.

Look = 4.25 Pours a deep black into an opaque black in the glass with 2 fingers of dark brown head that fades slowly to a cap with above average lace.  Aroma = 4.0 Sweet chocolate milk dominates and that’s about all I get from it. Smells great but one dimensional.

Not a ton of complexity or depth, but delicious. Body has a hershey syrup thickness to it. Really well done.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 No bottle date. 12 oz. bottle into a Madtree snifter. Pours an incredibly dark brown - nearly black. Needless to say, pitch black in the glass. A gentle pour yielded a thin lacing of tan-colored foam. I'd imagine a slightly more aggressive pour could've produced a thicker head, but with a 12 oz. glass capaicty, it was pretty much impossible. Faint, yet plesant notes of rich, dark chocolate and roasted malt on the nose. A slight coffee scent is present as well. I got a bit of vanilla and marshmellow as it warmed. Heavy weight with a creamy & smooth mouthfeel. Just about perfect for a big stout. Maybe slightly over-carbonated for my liking, but hey. Huge roasted malt and bitter chocolate up front, wow. Very delicious. Increasing bitterness middleways. Sweetens out on the back end and sees notes of vanilla and cream. Bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt, followed by expresso on the aftertaste.    This beer really impressed me. I'd stack this up to Rasputin or Ten Fidy anyday.

The taste is overly sweet. Any hops or bitterness is easy down in the profile. I wonder if it would be better really fresh.     The chocolate is also missing or over powered. This is not recommended unless you want sweet and nothing but sweet.

Taste: The taste profile features moderate chocolate notes with some mild roast malt notes. The beer finishes with the semi-bitter chocolate notes . The beer has a very restrained alcohol presence.    Mouth-feel: On the heavy side of medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation.    Overall: A good non bal-aged Imperial Stout. Very nice bittersweet chocolate profile.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Bought in Charleston during my honeymoon in June of 2010. I saved it at 53 degrees for this last 5 years to open after celebrating our 5 year anniversary. 12 oz bottle (label states 09-10 winter bottling) poured into a snifter on 07/08/2015. Knowing what I know now about aging beers, I would never have chosen a stout (except maybe Courage, but that wasn't made in 2010) to age for 5 years. Many imperial stouts can change in positive ways over 1-2 years, but very few can make it past 3-4 without developing off flavors that slowly erode anything positive about the flavor.     Pours black with no highlights, living up to its name. Pours with an impressive 2 fingers of coffee head. More than 5 years in the bottle and 10% alcohol and it still forms a head. Hopefully the flavor held up this well!    The aroma is subtle, with a hint of wet coffee grounds, bark, and a touch of alcohol sting. Not very inspiring.    The flavor is actually pretty impressive. Cherry-infused ultra dark chocolate shavings, salty chocolate sauce, burnt coffee, and darkly toasted bread crust come to mind. I was expecting much more of the meaty/salty grossness that shows up in stouts as they get too old (autolysis?) and was happy to find it is still restrained.     The mouthfeel is outstanding. Still carbonated, but heavy and thick. There is a little sweetness left and that helps a lot. Not dirty-water consistency like some older beers.    Conclusion: Knowing what I know now about the general principals of cellaring, I would have opened this when it was right about 3 years old, and judging by how it is now, I bet it would have been sublime. However, it is still pretty good. Not a bad way to celebrate 5 years of marriage!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 355ml bottle into an oversized tulip. Paid £3.50 for a single bottle.    Pours an opaque, pitch-black body that is unchanged when held to the light. A one-finger in height, dense, tan coloured, bubbly head slowly reduces to a thin collar around the edge of the glass, leaving behind small amounts of fine lacing.     Rich, dark, roasted malts and fresh-ground espresso dominate the nose. Noticeable in the background are dark molasses, bitter chocolate and alcohol. Upfront the taste leads with full-bodied, heavily roasted barley, chocolate malt and dark roasted coffee characters. Bittersweet chocolate and a delicate touch of caramel and vanilla sweetness follow. In the mouth it feels luxuriously smooth and creamy. The thick, robust and slightly oily body is complemented perfectly by a low, appropriate amount of carbonation that prevents it from becoming too filling. Smooth chocolate and tangy dark fruit linger on the palate throughout the finish, balanced perfectly by a slightly dry, bitter cocoa bite and alcohol warmth.     Overall this is a fantastic beer. Superbly well balanced, well crafted and indulgent, this is a treat to be sipped and savoured! Recommended.

Spicy, meaty, and smokey. Think mole rather than Mars Bar. Not my favorite offering by Brooklyn Brewery. I absolutely adore Local 2 which is one of my favorite beers but this is certainly interesting and complex.

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 2 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 Reviewed 3-13-15. Brandy Snifter. Bottle 2663 1333 (December 2013 release).    Appearance: Great smoke on popping the cap. Pours a deep black, totally opaque. Thin, tan cap fades to spotty islands of tan bubbles. Retains that tan skim down to the bottom of the glass.    Aroma: Sweet, fruity, some alcohol. Malt. Grapey, smoky.    Taste: Savory, meaty, salty, bitter, medicinal.    Mouthfeel: Heavy, slick, no carbonation.    Overall: A year old. What a year. This is so big, so bold, and slightly unpleasant. Sip slowly. Perhaps because the snow has melted, I am not feeling this; I love the aroma, and don't care for the taste. I love BBCS [one of my favorite brews, period], but I think maybe it's better without the age! [Or at least a full year of age].

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Appearance - 4.25/5  Pours pitch black, with about a finger of dark tan-brown head. Dissipates down to a thin layer of head.    Smell - 3.5/5  Strong chocolate smells along with a little alcohol smell. Perhaps a slight breadiness as well. The aroma is not sweet.    Taste - 4/5  Chocolate, slightly sweet. Cocoa, slightly fruity malts. Small alcohol taste is detectable.    Mouthfeel - 4/5  Medium body. Smooth. Little to no bitterness. Carbonation is light.    Overall - 4/5  This is a decent beer. The chocolate taste is nice. I would have liked a more complex smell and taste. And perhaps a tiny bit more carbonation. Otherwise, a good Russian Imperial Stout.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 Pours a perfect black with a light brown/dark khaki head. 1 finger, some lacing. The nose is dark chocolate. Not pure cocoa but rather strong 75-80% dark chocolate because there is a sweetness in there. Some coffee notes but I can only really describe that as a Vienna roasted burnt coffee. It tastes very assertive at first but really smooths out as you go. At first it seemed a bit boozy but I was drinking it a bit too cold. As it warmed the complexity of this beer really came out. Creamy mouthfeel, perfect gentle carbonation. Finishes a bit sweet and malty and not roasted and bitter enough for my taste of Russian imperial stouts. This was a very good beer and it has some potency too at 10% abv.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 The nose is cocoa, chocolate with faint espresso but not a lot of roast. Pours very dark brown to black under a vigorous, finely bubbled, persistent, lacy light tan cap. The palate has chocolate flavors from the malts blending with the added chocolate flavors over a variety of grain flavors and hints of caramel. It finishes with lingering bittersweet chocolate flavors. Very well balanced. The texture is very creamy, close to a nitro beer and is very full bodied to chewy. The carbonation is very fine and soft.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Pours pitch black with a finger width foamy head. Head retention is mild. Lacing is decent. Dark chocolate, licorice and slight coffee aroma. Maltiness is more light bodied with a stronger black licorice taste. You can detect some dark chocolate smoothness. Hints of coffee at the end. Not much of a roasted taste, which I come to expect from Imperial stouts. A little too much licorice for my taste as well. It does hide the alcohol very well. Probably could have used some more aging to bring out the chocolate taste better.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Presentation: From a 12 oz long neck from a 4 pack with date. Says the 2014-2015 season.     Appearance: Like it says...black. I can't even see through it when I hold it up to a light. Maybe a little brown. Superb lacing that remains in it's place. Moderate carbonation is present but it's hard to see because of the black.     Smell: Coffee and yeast, fresh bread like smell.     Taste: Dark robust coffee, dark bitter chocolate, burnt malt undertones, some sweetness (that is thankfully fleeting), and then hops are present towards the end to complement the coffee and dark chocolate.     Overall: This is one of my favorite stouts. High ABV with a prefect pairing of chocolate and coffee. A lot of times these double stouts or high ABV stouts have a sickly sweet taste and aftertaste that prevails. This one avoids that brewing mistake and gives you what you want from a stout...something to get through the frigid cold of winter. I highly recommend this brew!

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 A: A finger of tan, long sustaining head poured from the bottle then slid into the pitch black beer leaving behind a trail of lacing on the side of the glass.    S: Moderate sweet chocolate, cocoa and toffee aroma. no hops. Light alcohol/ethenol. roasty and ashy notes mild to moderate.    T: Dark chocolate, cocoa, milk chocolate and slight roasted character. Middle malts with toast, cookies and sweet toffee. Sweetness overall is mellow and not clowing. Slight underlying nutty flavor. hop bitterness is mild. Balance is on the roast and chocolate malts.    M:Big round viscous body with a creamy mouthfeel. Mild carbonation and slight parching dryness on the tongue from the roasted malts. Medium alcohol warming.     O: A chocolate forward, creamy stout that paired great with a big piece of german chocolate cake.   
look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 A: Thin bubbly head that sticks around for a while. Medium carbonation, dark-brown essentially black. (3/3)  S: Light chocolate and sweet malt with a healthy amount of ethanol. (9/12)  T: Chocolate much more solid with a metallic middle and bitter coffee finish. (16/20)  M: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Nothing special. (4/5)  O: It’s a strong chocolate stout, that’s for sure. Would have liked a little more chocolate or coffee to balance out the metallic taste and alcohol burn, but it’s certainly not a bad beer. Pair this guy with a sweet dessert or some dark meat, and it’ll take the edge off. (7/10)  39/50

Generous dark tan head develops with nice cascading effect, settling to a film with bubbles and lacing around the edges.     Smell: Roasty, boozy, fruity    Taste: sweet roasted malt with fruity alcoholic twang, very mild bitterness towards the finish. Strong alcoholic signature.    Feel: Smooth mouthfeel, thick body    Overall: A very complete imperial stout, with a complex palate and a fine presentation. In the end, it may be a bit on the sweet side for my taste and the alcohol is more apparent than with some stouts of this strength. Overall, though, a really fine brew.

Not much in the way of head, and what was there dissipated fairly quickly. The net result looks like a glass of pure, distilled, well, blackness.    Smell: More than a hint of alcohol, which is not entirely surprising given that the ABV is in double figures, but at the same time there's an underlying chocolate maltiness with more than a hint of dark fruit. That said, initial whiffs of alcohol aside this isn't a big smelling beer. What's there is nice, though.    Taste: Reminds me more of a coffee stout (along the lines of the Bad Seed Espresso stout I had earlier in the evening) than a chocolate stout along the lines of Sam Smiths. Even so, the coffee and chocolate taste combine to give something reminiscent of very dark dark chocolate (think 90% cacao-type stuff)    Feel: Heavy, yet smooth - not surprising given the ABV, though. This is one for kicking back and sipping - there's a nice transition from the coffee and chocolate tastes up front to the malty, alcoholic burn of the finish. Really quite exquisite.    Overall: I think I have a new favourite stout - for me, this one ticks all the boxes although some might find it a bit too bitter and astringent. Me? I think it's fantastic - just a pity it's harder to get than my other favourite (Sam Smiths Imperial Stout). If you see this, try it - it's great in a bottle, I'd love to try it on tap.

Dated "Winter '14-'15". 10% abv    Appearance- Coal black with a brown head that dissipates very fast.    Smell- Rich dark chocolate. Dark fruit in there as well reminisient of prunes. Smaller hints of coffee as well as sweet malt.    Taste- A rich sweetness meets the palate first. Deep, fresh chocolate notes abound. Quite nice. The chocolate rises through and through. A raison-like sweetness arrives as well. Finishes with a slight bitterness as well as a burn from the alcohol. Phenolic taste in there as well.    Mouthfeel- Very thick and quite heavy in body. The cream like consistancy coats the palate heavily.     Overall- This is a Winter sipping treat. Well done from all ends. Rich flavors persist throughout. The chocolate is fresh and pronounced. The high alcohol is appropriate for the style and season as well. I plan on ageing a bottle as well for a year +. Check this stout out!

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 Taken from notes. Been a day since I consumed the beer. Here goes:    A: Pitch black, nice head and lacing. Good.    S: Lots of dark fruit, some coffee bitterness and chocolate as well but these are less pronounced. Raisins, prune, coffee. OK, but the scents were actually somewhat muted - i.e., they weren't very powerful.    T: Good, but nothing special. Lots of dark fruit - such as prunes, raisins, and plum - followed by some coffee bitterness that lingers as the back of the tongue. Not very chocolatey, at least relative to other beers. Good, but not very good.    F: Thick and creamy. Good.    O: Good beer. Pretty solid, but there are definitely better options.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 2.75 A - Pours and oily jet black, generates a finger and a half of dark burnt caramel colored head which quickly dissipates down to a film. Little to no lacing.   S - Interesting and unexpected, dark chocolate and milk, almond, cherry and marzipan, light banana, dark fruits and some spices like nutmeg or cinnamon.   T - I wish the taste matched the smell. A strange and out of place sourness mixes with the initial carbonation bite, dark bitter sweet chocolates and roasty malts fade in well into the development, but I can't get passed the funky sourness right at the beginning, has no place in a stout like this.   O - The developmental Flavors and aftertaste are amazing, but this beer let me down and wasn't near the legendary stout I had hoped it was. The funky sourness at the beginning was a major turn off. Going to cellar my other three and see if aging helps. Otherwise, the beer is painfully average.   V - So far, the value is pretty low.

Nose of dark sweet chocolate, rich malts, and strong alcohol. Flavors are intense chocolate and coffee flavors, thick and coating, yet light and drinkable with a trademark smoothness. Moderate carbonation makes this one of the better winter Imperial Stouts out there. Finishes wet and chewy with a solid lightly bitter roasted malt quality with a light hops background.     OUTSTANDING!

Overall, a decent beer, just a bit confusing for a supposed chocolate stout. Maybe my pour? Will try again when I can.

I am very disappointed since the beer I got seems to be very flat. Smell is good, look is like used motor oil with no head at all, and the taste is like the apperance...flat. I will try this beer again and revise my review when I get a good bottle.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 An outstanding RIS. Cracked open a bottle from 2012, was hot back upon release but has mellowed into an exceptional blend of chocolate and roasted notes. A little smoke caps this off. Comes together wonderfully, and lives up to the fantastic, jet black appearance from the bottle pour. Mouthfeel is suitably decadent - this is a high quality confection in a glass.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pour from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip... color is black and completely opaque, crowned by a thin tan head that left light lacing.    Aroma is fairly subtle, coffee, roasted malts, a faint trace of alcohol.    Flavor is rich and complex- the promised bittersweet cocoa notes are right up front. Moving in after are notes of toast and espresso and molasses, finishing with a slightly nutty dryness with slight herbal hop notes. All flavors are very balanced, with nothing being too dominant.    Mouthfeel is smooth and rich without being syrupy, and lightly carbonated. A pleasure to drink.     An excellent RIS overall. Not as challenging and distinctive as Oskar Blues Ten-FIDY, but definitely with a broader appeal. Perfect for wintertime.    VERTICAL TASTING NOTE- 11/23/18: Cannot find an exact bottling date, but this bottle is from the same Winter "14-15" bottling I reviewed above. Aroma seems to have deepened, with some vanilla and dark raisin-ish notes mingling with the cocoa and coffee. Flavors are even smoother than before, dark chocolate being a bit more apparent and coffee bitterness slightly rounded off and pushed to the very end of the finish. Any booziness from the alcohol has been effectively cloaked. Not noticing any oxidized 'wet cardboard' flavor. All in all, this one aged very nicely indeed.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Came up on a list of high rated beers and I knew that I needed to try this one.    A - Dark black color. Fluffy tan colored head with light lacing.    S - Strong roasty aroma with burnt characteristics and some dark cocoa. There is some alcohol and coffee tones after the roasted notes.     T - Very similar to the smell; much of the burnt roastiness at the front along with the coffee and some dark cocoa. The roasted bitterness is strong and predominant. It took me off guard since I was expecting more chocolate and not so much "Black". It's good but it seems that the roasted, burnt character is the primary flavor with some chocolate, coffee, and caramel afterwards.   .   M - Full mouth-feel. Medium carbonation. The roasted bitterness lingers on the palate but it does have the highest carbonation of a RIS that I've ever had so it attempts to balance the thickness.    Overall, this is a good imperial stout. I wouldn't seek this out again just because there are so many other more delicious RIS's out there. I know that someone else may prefer this take on the style more than a sweeter more caramel or coffee inspired beer but I do not. I would suggest you spend your money elsewhere like on an Old Rasputin or if you can find it a delicious Ten Fidy.     Glass- Boston Lager perfect pint

Alcohol again is present.     Feel: Fell bodied, as stout should be.     Overall: I'm not feeling very creative for this portion right now. Busy drinking.

The smell is chocolate, (duh), burnt and sweet malts, coffee and some dried fruits.     The taste follows the nose; the chocolate hits first, followed by the burnt malt, then coffee, then sweet malt then finishing with chocolate. The chocolate is present in the taste from beginning to end. It goes down creamy smooth; sweet but there are just enough hops present on the back end to prevent it from being too sweet. There is also a warming effect, maybe just a little alcohol taste is leaking through; I can't tell for sure.    Overall, it is chocolate and a Stout, try it with your favorite cheese.

S/Roasted Malts, chocolate, slight hints of vanilla, a little nutty, and maybe a little vanilla. T/It was the thickness that I expected of such a stout. I tasted the roasted malts and chocolate on the first sip. It was very bitter, but the bitterness subsided as it warmed and that is when the flavor really started to shine revealing small hints of vanilla with the roasted chocolate. O/I would definitely seek this out again. It was well worth the purchase.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip    A: Pour is black as night with a huge head that eventually settles to 1 finger in size and caps the beer perfectly. The cap of the beer never recedes and leaves a good amount of lacing that leaves rings down most of the glass.    S: Smell is mainly bittersweet chocolate, with roasted malts and a faint presence of alcohol. Caramel and vanilla start to come out as the beer warms. There is also a bit of a nutty aroma with some toasty/smokiness.    T: Big, robust flavors of dark chocolate and roasted malts with a touch of dry smokiness on the finish. Also caramel with a touch of brown sugar. No hint of hops or alcohol whatsoever.    M: Very smooth and slick on the palate with a full body and a low level of carbonation. Very drinkable for such a big beer, with alcohol masked very well for 10% ABV.    O: This is a solid, cheaply priced RIS that I look forward to every year. It isn't as outstanding as certain other imperial stouts, but it is a good beer that showcases the style well. Great aromas/flavors of bittersweet chocolate and roasted malts, and at $10 a 4 pack you can't go wrong. One of my favorite offerings from Brooklyn Brewery that never disappoints. Everyone rants and raves about how well it ages, so I will have to age one and see for myself.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a snifter from a 12 ounce bottle.     Pours viscous and oil-like. Black gold. Forms a finger and a half of chewy, dark khaki and espresso-colored head. Persists well. Body is dark as the back of Forrest Whitaker's neck. 4.5    Smells of dark cherries and/or a cherry cordial. Dark chocolate for certain. Some sort of Xmas treat. 4.25    Learhery and tobacco-like, so I'm thinking it's barrel-aged. Not sure, but it seems that way. Dark cherry flavors continue true to the nose, blended with bitter dark chocolate and vanilla notes. A touch of earthy hops linger on the finish. 4.25    As the pour led me to believe, this is viscous, smooth and creamy. Carbonation is light and some hops give a touch of bitterness on the finish. 4.25    Damn great beer that probably deserves more love.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 12 oz. bottle poured into snifter  (winter 2014-15)    L: black motor oil coming out of bottle; a hard pour renders a huge, thick head of brown foam ... dark, almost reddish color to it ... sticks hard at top; liquid looks clear dark dark brown up to light; keeps a great collar    S: bourbon and vanilla ... dark chocolate, espresso, astringent coffee, too, but this smells like a bourbon barrel-aged brew ... lots of vanilla and bourbon; strangely as it warms, starts putting out a vodka/gin burn    T: thick dark malt notes of bitter chocolate, mocha latte, vanilla, a hint of wood/oak ... nothing is burnt, just very, very dark ... OK, maybe a *little* burnt, but it's bitter notes are smoothed out by all the vanilla and sweeter notes; mostly hides the alcohol ... mostly    F: thick, oily, slick at times, but it also comes across as relatively light ... the hard pour didn't sap it of too much carbonation, still full    O: great brew, but then I'm a sucker for the big stout ... this one amazes me in how much of the bourbon barrel-aged notes it has, especially the vanilla. shows a little bit of alcohol heat but for the most part it keeps the alcohol reined in.     good enough that I've bought another 4-pack to keep around until next winter to see how it ages. perhaps a bit lighter/sweeter than the average Russian Imperial (think milk chocolate/vanilla over semisweet chocolate/licorice), but still full of lots of dark malt goodness.

look: 4.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 Pours a beautiful dark chocolate brown color with a rocky, firm and tan head and really awesome, sticky lacing. Aroma is very dark chocolately with a hint of coffee. Taste is upfront with the booze(10% ABV), but once you get past that, the chocolate(bittersweet) and light roasted coffee flavors come through. Mouthfeel is decent, with a little alcohol burn, but stilla little malt sweetness and smoothness, overall, not bad, but think it would be a little more enjoyable at maybe 7-8% ABV...   
look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 5 I've had alot of chocolates and I have to say that this is flat out, the best chocolate stout that exists. I'm also a fan of russian imperials so it's a WHAMMY for me.    I'll edit my post at a future date. Right now, it's not in my glass but it was this night so I wanted to atleast put my 2 cents forward. pay attention to the taste and overall most. I'll clean up the rest later but I gave guesstimates for now.
