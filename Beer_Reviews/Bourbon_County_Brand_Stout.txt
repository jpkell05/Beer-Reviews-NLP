Poured a dark chocolate with a one finger mocha frothy head that dissipated quickly to nothing. Aroma is faint molasses, chocolate, malt and bourbon. The aroma becomes more pungent as the brew warms. Taste is sweet malt, bourbon and caramel forward with hints of rich dark chocolate and dark fruit in the middle with black licorice, bourbon and burnt toast on the finish, which lingers. This is a real sipper . . . a thick boozy stout that makes your rear molars float. ;) OMG . . . I'm in love with a sexy woman with rich tastes that I cannot afford! Yet . . . I just have to have her . . . :)

It has an overly sweet and syrupy taste that makes me gag at first sip. Imagine someone poured whiskey in your Guiness then added several sugar substitute(Sweet n Low) packets a splash of milk and then let it stew in a sweaty dorm room for a few days. Foul and one of the worst beers I've ever tried. Bought a 12 pack and gave away 9. Tried 3 times to be a convert, but am convinced people are afraid to say it's gross and not be considered a connoisseur.

This one is smoother, cleaner and just plain nice. The ABV is a little on the high side to drink more than one a night and that it is a seasonal those are its only down sides.   It has(had :)) a nice bourbon smell, with the normal hints of vanilla. It has a nice buttery back taste(might be what they say is caramel(I make my own caramel and it does not taste like butter.) with a nice soft smoke taste.    IT is my new seasonal favorite.

Minimal head that quickly dissipated into a thin ring. Slight bubble lacing while drinking. A bit underwhelming. (Same as 2018)    Nose: sweet malts, just a hint of bourbon up front. Lots of Dark brandied fruit. Really nice but more subtle than the 2018 from Nov.     Taste: rich dark chocolate, sweet bourbon up front. Deep roasted malt, some bitter coffee in the middle. Dark fruits and more chocolate, maybe some burnt toast on the backend. Really well balanced. A little less chocolate, a little more sweet malt than the fresh 2018 but still Outstanding.     Mouthfeel: rich, thick but not syrupy. Coats the tongue, lingers a bit but finishes well balanced and relatively clean. Moderate to low carbonation; just enough to tingle the tongue. Not as pilllowy as fresh 2018. Still really good.    Overall: high expectations and this lived up to them. BCBS remains a/the standard by which other BA stouts are measured. Liked the fresh 2018 a bit better. Maybe more similar to the year old 2017. Ages well but makes me really appreciate the 2018.     ==============    2018 Vintage reviewed Nov 23 2018 (2017 Vintage Below)  Purchased at Total Wine today, Black Friday, or BCBS day.     Pour: Black with a little brown time or maybe that’s the deep tan head. Minimal head that quickly dissipated into a thin ring. Slight bubble lacing while drinking. A bit underwhelming.     Nose: sweet malts, bourbon up front. Dark brandied fruit. Hints of dark chocolate and coffee. Really nice.     Taste: rich dark chocolate, sweet bourbon up front. Deep roasted malt, some bitter coffee in the middle. Dark fruits and more chocolate, maybe some burnt toast on the backend. Really well balanced. Even more chocolate than I recall and bourbon very mellow and balanced. Outstanding.     Mouthfeel: rich, pillowy, thick but not syrupy. Coats the tongue, lingers a bit but finishes well balanced and relatively clean. Moderate to low carbonation; just enough to tingle the tongue. Outstanding.     Overall: wow! I had high expectations and this lived up to them, again. As with the 2017, and previous vintages, BCBS remains a/the standard by which other BA stouts are measured.     ==============    2017 vintage. Reviewed Nov 20 2018. Purchased at Total WIne in Sarasota (Siesta Key) today. Couldn't get last year at home so very happy to find it here.    Pour: Jet black, maybe a hint of dark brown. 1-2 finger deep tan head. Ends in a few clouds and a thick ring. Pretty solid lacing, more like coating of the glass.     Nose: bourbon, dark, sweet fruit, vanilla and oak, chocolate, molasses.     Taste: heavy bourbon, some coffee (recognizing it's not a coffee stout), dark chocolate. Brandied fruit, figs, some vanilla and oak. Fair amount of hops bitterness on the backend. Relatively clean finish despite the intensity of the flavors. You have to like bourbon to like this.     Mouthfeel: thick, thick, milkshake like. Moderate carbonation. Coats the tongue but not cloying and finishes pretty clean.   Perfect.     Overall: this is still the standard for BBA stouts IMO. Have a bottle to age and will likely pick up another one or two assuming they are still on the shelf.

Barely a finger of dark tan head that quickly dissipates into a ring; even changing how I pour it doesn't get more head.    Smell: Very sweet. Chocolate, coffee, milk, and some roast malt.    Taste: A big blast of chocolate and roasted malt, fading into roast coffee notes. Very sweet, almost sickly so.    Mouthfeel: Thick and full-bodied, with virtually no carbonation.    Overall: I'm going to be in the minority and say no to this beer. The insanely sweet taste is an immediate turn-off, to the point where even finishing the glass is hard. It comes off highly unbalanced.

Unfortunately, I can only say "like" as it seems to be true that you can have too much of a good thing. The over-the-top ABV and flavors just don't meld for a great overall experience. And that's from a guy who loves other "big" bourbon beers like KBS, Parabola, BA TenFidy, BA Expedition, etc. Individual notes of bourbon, leather, tobacco, licorice, chocolate, charred grains, etc are all there, but the ABV is just a couple points too high to allow all that goodness to come together. Instead of doing everything possible to push this beer to 11, I wish they had just the slightest restraint and allowed all the goodness to come out in full. Still a pretty good beer, but definitely not at the hype level. A bit tough to finish the whole thing over the course of a long sitting.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 Since it didn't require any chasing around this year with plenty on the shelf, I decided to buy a couple; one to drink, one for the cellar. Aroma is whiskey with roasted malts, caramel, vanilla, dark fruits. Deep black with just a slight brown tinge around the edges with a back light. Short tan head dies quickly to a ring with an island in the middle. No lacing. Thick, chewy, substantial body initially on the tongue. Deep flavor of whiskey, roasty raisins, caramel, vanilla, and alcohol. Sweet and delicious. The finish is mild (low bitterness) with an alcohol burn. This stout is dangerously easy drinking and smooth. I had to keep reminding myself of the ABV... slowly, sip slowly!

Taste was of pure soy sauce, with hints of vanilla bean and cheap bourbon flavoring. 2018 is an absolute bust.

Aged oak, caramel, vanilla, and slight applewood smoke on the nose.    On the palate I first noticed the wonderfully smooth mouthfeel. Bourbon hits in the front and the mid, with a sweet smokiness on the end. It's a strong taste, and if you're looking for a bourbon barrel stout you shouldn't be disappointed. It's big and festive, great for the season. Would go very well as an after dinner beer if you're skipping dessert (with a sweet, I'd find it too cloying).    Even though I feel like I'm more over the bourbon barrel craze each year, this is one that makes you stop and appreciate the arc of American craft beer in the last 15-20 years

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 2018 vintage. Bottled on 9/17/18. 16.9oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours almost black with some brown hues; dark khaki head that fades nice retention and lacing. The aromas are balanced, but pretty bold. The bourbon comes through along with some chocolate. Hints of caramel along with some mild hints of vanilla. It has a chocolate chip cookie vibe going on. Some char and peat most in the mix. Some oak. Malts are there. The flavors basically follow the nose, but are even bolder. Once again everything is balanced, but bold. It's on the sweeter side, but it's not cloying or over the top at all. The bourbon shines without dominating. More chocolate, caramel along with some hints of vanilla. More hints of oak/wood in the mix. There's a subtle spiciness in the finish. Low bitterness. Very nice malt backbone. Mild warmth in the finish, but the alcohol is definitely hidden, which is very impressive. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full-bodied with moderate to low carbonation. It's fluffy, creamy, velvety and very smooth. This beer is the epitome of being dangerously drinkable.    This is an awesome stout. It's worthy of the hype. In a way it's simple, straight forward and not flashy. It's just just simply executed at the highest level. It's scary how smooth it is. Balance is honestly the key with this one. The craftsmanship is top notch. This is definitely an elite barrel-aged stout. Great stuff.

Silky smooth, disguised abv, nice caramel and coconut hints that are still noticeable through the chocolate, coffee and bourbon.     Really want to try the Vanilla and (true) Coffee versions

Head is tan and minimal, disappears quickly with no lacing on the glass. Tastes of subtle bourbon, dark chocolate, and ripe plums. Feel is exceptionally smooth, far smoother than any beer of this strength has any right to be. Definitely among the best beers I've ever tasted.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Nice, thick, warm, and the stout character balanced well against the bourbon. I'm up for having this any week. GI is still the godfather of bourbon barrel aged stouts imo, and 2018 didn't prove me wrong.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 2018 vintage - and hoooo boy. Surely worth scavenging if the seller admits to having any in its (ahem, backroom) holdings (yes, this is indeed from a personal experience of which I am alluding to). Pretty much the only product that A-B is going to get any coinage from me with.    I mean, really though. Worthy of the score it has garnered by me fellow toasters - of which I am pleased to contribute to.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 This brew pours a nice rich dark mahogony with nice lite tan foam with minimal to no lacing.  The old factory picks up a lot of things, and hard to decypher, but has chocolate, vanilla, some smoke along with the ABV coming thru a bit.  Taste nicely follows the nose...in just about the same order with a great smoothness to it...with ABV.  This is one fine stout to sit back and enjoy a cheroot (cigar) of your choice, and just grin and have everyone wonder...  Can't wait to try the other one I put in the cellar to come out... in a few years. Patience!

Taste is very complex with coffee, bitter cocoa, caramel, vanilla, oak, and booze being overt. Subtle notes of anise, fig, and oatmeal come in on the back side. Overall, I think this beer lives up to the reputation it has deservedly received as a must try for BBA stout lovers.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Sampled December 2018 from 16.9oz bottle in snifter style glass. There is a bottled on date of August 12, 2017 date on listed on the bottle.    Appearance: Very dark black, dark color, with a dark tan head of 1 finger. The head lasted only a short length of time, and did not leave much lacing on the side of the glass.    Smell: Strong bourbon, oak, and caramel aromas. There are also roasted fire aromas, along with some coffee, vanilla, and hops in the aroma. Nice combination and balance between the bourbon barrel, hops, malts, and other aromas.    Taste: Pronounced bourbon and caramel flavors. Also coffee and burnt malt flavors. Full-bodied with great balance of malt and hops. It is very smooth. There is a hint of sweetness like chocolate that may be due to the oats and malts, but it has an excellent taste. Light hop flavor as well. The bourbon barrel flavors provide for a unique stout.    Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, with strong alcohol which matches with the 14.1% on the label.    Overall: This barrel-aged Stout is an excellent imperial stout. It has strong flavors as well as alcohol, and the mix of oak, malts, and hops makes for a unique and interesting stout. Probably the best barrel-aged stout I have tried. I would buy this again.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours black with a very thin dark brown head that is gone afte the pour is finished. No lacing to be seen.    Smells like soy sauce primarily. But you also get bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, wood. There is a lot going on. Oddly enough I dont get too much alcohol considering the ABV.    The taste consists of large amount of dark fruits and vanilla. Good amounts of oak and bourbon. Sweet chocolate. And a fairly high alcohol warmth.     The mouthfeel is full bodied. Its thick, viscous and extremely smooth. It coats the pallet nicely. Carbonation is soft.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 I’ve been waiting a long time to try this beer, a 2018 15.2 edition. I was elated when I got an email from BevMo, their daily spamming is annoying but news that they have beer that I’ve been impatiently waiting for is the only reason I tolerate it. A hard pour produced a modest head that soon dissolved to a ring around the circumstance with a very very dark body. Very pretty aroma: chocolate, alcohol, dark fruits,licorice, oak barrel, bourbon & plenty more to entertain the nose. Taste is quite sweet with a slightly bitty finish. Flavor, it’s a chocolate chip cookie dunked in bourbon with lots of char & barrel flavors, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel & so much more. Feel is moderately thick & silky smooth. The tongue didn’t find any carbonation, which always seems to run inversely to ABV but sure did enjoy the flavors. Not much heat detected either but once it reaches the stomach, it feel like someone lit a match. Overall this is one of the greatest stouts ever made. I’ll be headed back to BevMo to try the other 2 variants they have there.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 2018 edition. Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a goblet.    Look - Pitch black, like used motor oil. No head or lacing. Very still. Slightly menacing looking.    Smell - Chocolate chip cookies immediately come to mind, but it's quickly covered up with vanilla, oak, alcohol, all the normal bourbon smells. Some hints of mushrooms, meat, bell peppers, and soy sauce in there too if you keep your nose in it long enough. An interesting mix of scents.    Taste - Starts with the usual bourbon suspects, slides into black licorice and soy before transitioning to a sweet chocolate that fades over to bitter chocolate. Ends on a tiny bit of herbal earthiness and a spicy alcohol warmth. Each sip is like a little journey.    Feel - Thick, oily, creamy, viscous. Coats you mouth, and has an almost chewy texture. No real carbonation to talk about.    Overall - Everybody already knows this is a good beer, and I definitely cannot deny it either. I'm glad it only comes around once a year though, I feel like I might get tired of it if I always had it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 2018 Vintage poured into a 5oz stem at about 48F. This particular bottle states 14.7% ABV - weird - I have another that says 15.2%    Pours a thick, used motor oil blackish brown. Midnight black in the glass, with subtle mahogany highlights on the very thinnest edges. A vertical hard pour yields barely a centimeter of mocha head, that dissipates very fast, leaving nothing behind. A still, black abyss.    Nose is just delightful. Fudgy cocoa, caramel, vanilla, some currant/cherry/cranberry/dark fruit, definite bourbon, barrel char, oak, and extra doses of chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Smells like the perfect BBA stout.     Palate begins as sweet dark chocolate. I mean massively sweet. But it's not TOO sweet, because you get that lovely char that cuts in. Lightly tannic barrel char. You get the immediate notes of bourbon, which is organic and restrained. Dark fruit comes in big, with cherry and currant coming to mind. Some fig and dates. These fruity notes take center stage and occupy the mid-palate, offering beautiful contrast to the dark chocolate base. Then, after the chocolate covered cherry middle, you get that bourbon, that char, that oak, some smoke, some vanilla, some tobacco, all immediately after the swallow. These linger and fade, leaving bourbon, oak, and vanilla as the lasting impression. Absolutely wonderful.    Mouthfeel on this is full and rich, but it's not in a syrupy way. No, it's not quite...sludgy. it's more like a sweet liqueur. It's a little viscous, but at the same time, very liquid and fluid. Hard to describe. I've had some THICK BA stouts before, and this isn't like that. It feels more...fluid. nevertheless, a great feel.    Overall, this is just a remarkable barrel aged imperial stout. It shares my #1 BA stout spot with Bell's BA Expedition. Both are unique. There's just something about this that just seems so refined and perfect. Well rounded and nuanced. It's big, bold, sweet, complex, smooth, and just an absolute treat. A bottle is a lot to drink at once, but only because of how rich it is. I will seek this out ever year. It's just that good.

Smell - I don’t have a tuned nose for smells but wow this has amazing notes and make me love this so much!!   Taste - if drinking it proper, sip it! Each and every taste is a powerful boom in your mouth!, it is my fav behind Toppling Goliath brews. Those are a touch more powerful and have a better taste. This is so close to perfection. I’d buy it and I do buy it while it’s availabke because it’s so good!!

Didn’t want to crack a bottle, so tried a snifter on tap...luckily, there are several pubs with it on tap at release. Poured chilled. Barely any head, with a tiny mocha ring. Lots of legs when swirled. Super dark black, but a clean, clear black. Tight carbonation. Nose is awesome. Strong bourbon, sweet pit fruit, vanilla. First sips are equally awesome. The bourbon is boozy, sweet, with loads of vanilla, oak, char. Velvety smooth mouthfeel, crisp, full, with a great long malty aftertaste. Alcohol hidden well, but hits you fast after. Superb!

Beer is what it is. An experience to one's own preference. That is what hurts the brand when switching between brewmasters. They tend to forget what brought them to where they are. This year slightly misses the mark with body but makes up for it with barrel.     The last few years haven't been to kind to the brand name when compared to the past. This year on the other hand brings light to the darkness of the past.     The only thing that I wish is for a fuller body next year while holding the same presence of futures past.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Vintage 2018  Bottled September 25, 2018  Pours jet black with a 1/2' tan head. The head fades quickly as expected to a ring - no lace.  Initial aromas are rich malt, barrel, molasses and burnt caramel. Soy sauce note mixed in here as well. Dark fruits. Bourbon comes forward after 15 or so minutes in the glass.  Big bourbon flavor middle to long into the heated finish. Just a touch of vanillin and wood character. Savory note too, soy? Big malts that aren't overly roasty or bitter.  Silky mouthfeel, full bodied. Low carbonation. Long finish of charred wood and bourbon. Very hot @ 15.2% abv.  Very good, definitely a HUGE beer and a sipper.

This beer totally refreshed my interest in the style. The top of my list may not be as completely dominated by NEIPAs for long if I start running into competitors for this.    Went in on the Black Friday scramble for everything I could get here in Ohio. Tried the 2018 regular already and it is still incredibly impressive. Even a single year of aging does make a pretty big difference in smoothing and mellowing it out though. Looking forward to how these bottles turn out after some time aging.

So I figured a special day calls for something special. From the pour, to what met my nose, to what crossed my tongue, there's only one thing I can say...Wow...as in *wow*. Hot damn, this is good. This is one of those rare beers I have had that you simply take the time to enjoy, sip, slosh, experience, repeat...slowly...and I did. The look is perfectly black, even though there is no foam or lacing. The smell is an almost perfect blend of the bourbon and distinct stout scent, even with a hint of chocolate and coffee. The same can be said for the taste - and with a hint of heat from the booze, which adds an extra dimension to the overall experience. I can get the hype, I can ignore the hate, and I will be looking forward to the next one I can age and sit back and enjoy...

Smells of oatmeal, raisin, coffee, molasses, fig, cocoa and walnut.    Tastes insanely rich. Coffee, cocoa, molasses, mesquite, licorice, anise, plum, and red wine grapes come through. Underscored by biscuit, pecan, oak and walnut.    Body is full and syrupy. Light stinging carbonation on the tongue. Booze warmth going down.    I understand the fuss. This is a special experience. It does threaten to be overwhelming. Totally worth trying just to know, but I can see some people actually not liking this which is a shame for the price point. Still, for me and excellent beer.

S: Deep, strong, rich bourbon and wood-barrel notes, caramel malts, and dark chocolate. Pretty much exactly what you're looking for in a bourbon barrel stout.    T: There's a whole lot of molasses & sweetness, distracts from the bourbon flavor just a bit. Roasted malts, some dark chocolate, and light vanilla notes.    F: Full and thick, sticky, super sweet, low but really the perfect amount of carbonation, and a bit of bitterness. High level of alcohol is very well masked.    O: Really enjoyed this and can see why it's so highly regarded over the years, but it was just a level too sweet. Pretty much thought everything else was right on.

It had a great aroma of chocolate, vanilla, and burbon. The fullness was not as abrupt as say Parabola but still good. The dark roasted taste with the vanilla flavor complements well but the burbon barrel was a little lacking. Im going to age one a while to see and taste the change.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Bottle from 2011    A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a finger and a half of dense tan head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing  S: Smells of rich bourbon and fudge with a hint of espresso beans and roasted malts.  T: Taste is oak and fudge with molasses, caramel, and a hint of vanilla, light coffee and roasted malts with more chocolate and bourbon. On the swallow this one brings huge sticky bourbon flavors with more fudge and bitter dark chocolate along with some lingering espresso, molasses, and roasted malts.  M: This beer is big, sticky and thick with a slightly silky mouthfeel. Carbonation in low but adequate while the ABV gives this one a dry finish.  O: This beer is legendary. Incredible depth and complexity while almost seven years of age have smoothed out and tamed the beast. Shockingly together without any hints of oxidation or falling off. Curious to see how this compares to a fresher post AB merger.

Rich desert character on a fairly light body makes for a drinkable, yet flavorful beer at this ABV. The beer blends the bourbon aging so well into the experience that you can't believe that it is over 14% abv! I have another aging for a while after this one, but the one I had fresh was a must try.     Cheers!

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Bottled on 8/31/17    Pours a near-jet black with complete opacity. A soft, dark beige head forms and fades with a lasting hiss reminding me of a freshly-cracked soda. It leaves a thin ring, and shows a steady effervescence persisting through the darkness at the surface.    There are heavy aromas of milk chocolate, malt, booze, and barrel upfront. Further inspection yields a really pleasant whiff of fresh graham cracker, followed by some fig and the slightest hints of raspberry and cherry.    I'm tasting plenty of barrel and hefty notes of oaky chocolate malt from the get-go. The intensity softens, eventually allowing soft notes of fig, molasses, and toffee through to even things out.    The mouthfeel is slick and oily, but maintains balance through a restrained carbonation that weighs it out nicely.     I was excited to finally crack this open, and while it certainly didn't disappoint, I can't quite say it lived up to it's lofty reputation. For myself, it's possibly a victim of the great level of adjunct diversity in BA stouts nowadays, resulting in what is still undoubtedly a refined profile getting a bit lost in the shuffle on the wider flavor spectrum of today's stouts. Still, though, it's nothing to turn your nose at; it's high-quality stuff that's clearly been polished to a level worthy of a higher tier.

A: raisin fig and black cherry blend with a lovely chocolate and molasses. And of course big bourbon notes. Nice!    F: warm chocolates with fig and raisin. Bourbon and some light charred oaks.     M: smooth and warming with just a little alcohol in the background. Medium to full body with nice prickly carbonation. Finishes warm with lingering bourbon and chocolate notes.     O: exceptional beer. Nice BA Stout with full flavor and lovely blend of fruit flavors on top of the traditional chocolates, caramels and bourbon.    2018 BCBS poured Dec 2018  A: rich layers of fig, prune, rasin, toffee, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, dark cherry, lots of bourbon, and light oak. Amazing     A: dark brown to black with light head that falls quickly to a little lace around the glass     F: loads of mellow bourbon surrounded by vanilla, dark red fruits, toffee, chocolate, caramel, oak, and roasted malts. Slightly sweet.     M: rich and velvety with low carbonation. Lingering flavors of bourbon, prune, dark cherry and bourbon. Finishes just a little sweet    O: another amazing BCBS. Slightly sweeter than previous years but very enjoyable. Still my favorite beer year over year.

Meh retention; no lacing. Looks like coke. (3.5)    S:  Thick bourbony sweetness, vanilla darkfruits, oak, some booze, chocolate. (4.25)    T:  Mmmm. Thick, syrupy dollop of vanillins, raisins, oaky whiskey, chocolate, maple and general sweet/greasy/nutty roastiness. (4.5)    M:  Full, syrupy body with moderate carbonation and a warming boozy finish. (4)    O:  Very nice stout.  It isn't much to look at, but ends up packing a wollop in more ways than one. Very sweet on the whole. The nose is slightly fruity with some sweet roast notes and a lot of barrel character. The flavor follows suit with more chocolate and nuttiness. It is fairly boozy and warming. This is a fine beer that I'd gladly have again, nonetheless it is nothing I'd go out of my way for as it is just at my threshold for how sweet and how barrely I like a stout like this. Plus the look and feel didn't wow me like some. Still and all, extremely tasty. (4.25)

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 At first the hype for this beer seemed too good to be true. So I went in thinking it would be your run of the mill bourbon stout overfluffed by hype, with overpowering flavors singular flavor. But boy does it deserve the praise it gets.     Look is pitch black with almost no head as to be expected with this level of percentage. Smell is mostly of chocolate and coffee with a subdued bourbon smell.     First sip proves to be very drinkable , hints of coffee and chocolate with an aftertaste of smooth creamy bourbon with some carbonation. Goose island has done an amazing job of hiding this percentage, it was surprising I was expecting it to be a 9-10% but was shocked to see the tag say 14.7% for this batch.     Overall an amazing beer, tastes like a bourbon stout should without an overpowering bourbon taste. Definitely would recommend to anyone interested in getting into bourbon stouts. Very drinkable despite the percentage which is one of the things that blew me away along with that sensuous hint of bourbon at the end. It gives the right amount of hints of coffee, chocolate and bourbon without one flavor overpowering another, taste seems well balanced. Even those with high standards of stouts will enjoy. Will pick up a bottle to let it rest 2-3 years and see how it mellows out.

L---Black, absolutely black. Nice light brown head which faded to a film fairly quickly. Little lacing. Retention and lacing as expected for ABV.    S---Mostly chocolate. But milk chocolate, not the more common dark chocolate aroma in dark beers. Get some dark fruit smells. Boubon is there, but not predominant or in any way overpowering.     T---Wow, this is an all timer. A lot of milk chocolate. There aren't a lot of beers that have a truly lingering finish. This one does. Up to a minute later, there are still flavors showing up. The bourbon is there, as in the nose, but again is not predominant or overpowering. Raisins are there. NOWHERE near as boozy as I was expecting. GI really found a way to hide a 14.1% ABV. Impressive.     F---Minimal carbonation leaves a bit of a flat feel. Again, nowhere near the boozy feel I was expecting. This actually feels wet, not astringent.     O---Yeah, this one lives up to its billing. This is a truly extraordinary beer. This is what craft brewers should aspire to be. Expensive as balls (for the Aunt-in-law who gave it to me), but worth it.

I usually try one fresh, then put away for two years to mellow a little.  Appearance is black, mahogany highlights, no head, miniscule carbonation and lacing. No off scents or questionable carbonation or appearance.  Big bourbon scent, figs, gingerbread, almonds.  Tastes of raisins, prunes, butterscotch, dried fruit, bourbon. Alcohol is present but delayed reaction.  Full bodied, chewy, initial sweetness transitioning to balanced unami character. Flavors bloom as the glass warms.   Perfect winter sipper. I can always find five or six bottles without Black Friday hysteria, and consume them slowly in a few years. My 2015 bottles have all been good.

Extremely similar to Reserve and maybe only 2nd to Northwoods. Buying as much as I can because this will be a winner for many years.

This one was very expensive (€17 for a single 50cL bottle) and kind of exclusive in France.   I recently rated KBS as my favourite beer ever after having it for a few times and loving it each time more for its balance. I recently had CBS, it was great too.   This is one is over the top. This is a fantastic beer and almost the perfect beer for me. It's gourmet, balanced, tasty.     It pours a pitch black body with a nice mocha head, no lacing.     The smell might be the best one I've ever smelt. Just from the bottle I was like «huuuum, huuuum» for an hour with the coconut and chocolate character of the smell.   The bourbon is preominent in the aroma and flavour.   The taste is overall simple and perfectly balance with some nuts (amaretto) , chocolate, coffee, bourbon, astringent, a bit sweet. Really roasty.   Semi-dry, this beer has a low carbonation but a very enjoyable cocoa powder-like mouthfeel.   The, also, amazing thing about this beer is that it's 14.1% abv and it's not boozy at all, it's very drinkable. As it warms up it's a lit bit boozier but nothing over the top.     Overall this is a wonderful beer. I really love it. It's plain and simple. It's a beer and it's gracious.      Vintage 2018, 15.2% Abv  L - 4.25 S - 4.75 T - 5 F - 4.75 O - 5.0    Pitch black, almost no head  Alongside the cocoa, vanilla and bourbon, you've got some dark and red fruits notes (blueberries mostly).   The taste is very deep but incredibly balanced  The mouthfeel is thick and smooth.   Overall, I could drink this all day (where are the 15.2% abv??!), this is an amazing brew

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Dark brown with a hint of amber along the edges when held to the light. Topped with a half finger of deep beige, rusty tinted head.    Smells of soy sauce, umami, vanilla, fresh black liquorice pipes, brown sugar, molasses, toasted coconut, and roasted meat.    Bourbon, umami, soy sauce and a hint of liquorice, and brown sugar. Its slightly sweet but incredibly balanced.    Remarkably smooth body. Slightly oily, but the light, sparkling carbonation lightens it to a very smooth mouth feel. Alcohol is detectable only in the throat and the back of the tongue.     This is the 2017 version. Incredibly refined, in the sense of speaking of a gentleman. The mouth feel is what gets me most, making it so balanced and smooth, reminding me of others that are the best of the best. It reminds me of skull splitter in refinement, as it was a brew that took me to a new level in mouth feel. I don't really want to drink other beer in this category now, as all the off flavours and imbalances that are in so many, are not present here. This is my 2000th beer I've rated on Beer Advocate. I've saved this brew for this moment to celebrate! I found it a few weeks ago in Albany, NY, and I'm drinking it on the shores of Lake Muskoka this January 18th, 2018. Cheers!!!

Smell - dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, smoke, vanilla, and a lot of booze.  Taste - much more carbonation than I initially thought. dark chocolate and raisins dominate in taste. sweet and warm finish. fragrance of the dark chocolate lingers for quite some time. pretty damn close to perfection.  Feel - full bodied, medium carbonation, and is as smooth as it gets at 15%.  Overall - what can I say? This is an all time great. Dangerously sippable, and incredibly tasty. Perfect for the cold weather.

Not finding a whole lot of coffee or chocolate roasted barley, mostly getting the aged flavors that chocolate malt turns into - dark raisin, plum, cherry.    It's really good, yes, but to be honest it's not my top favorite ever, in a night of tastings of BA stouts.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 (2017 Edition)    Pours like any other huge stout - dark black with a dark tan head, the size of which depends how you pour.     I don't care about aroma of a beer so much as the taste. That being said, this beer does have a strong aroma. I get a lot of chocolate malt and bourbon.     Now comes the best part: the taste! And it's wonderful. Initially the candied raisins and dark chocolate hit your palate, then comes the roasted malt and some marshmallow. Lingering in the background (but not weak at all) is the bourbon. It melds so well with the base beer. The finish is long, thick, and full of that decedent chocolate. The best I can describe the taste is chocolate-covered raisins soaked in bourbon.     This beer has an oily texture that coats the mouth. It's big and creamy, and the stickiness lingers, but not too much.     Overall this is probably the best imperial stout I've tasted. There are BA stouts that over-do the bourbon, and some that under-do the bourbon, but this one seems to have the perfect ratio. Not only that, but the base beer is fantastic, and each flavor shines through. Perfect score!

I like stouts and porters but this imperial may be a little too much on the bitter side. There is an after that is not quite welcome.

Gave it a generous pour, but ended up with maybe half a finger of mocha colored head. Minimal lacing, but you can tell this is a viscous liquid.    Smell - a little bit of caramel and sweetness from the vanilla. Strong notes of fresh cocoa powder, bourbon    Taste - oak char, fudgey chocolate, toffee, and maple syrup. Little bit of the boozey bourbon flavor lingers at the end.    Mouth feel - minimal carbonation leads to a smooth mouth feel. Extremely viscous body, this might be the thickest stout I've had the pleasure of drinking. It's almost approaching a light syrup    Overall - remarkably well done stout. A bit heavy, but that's expected, especially for the ABV. I really appreciate the viscosity of the mouth feel. Well balanced and drinkable for the style.

Aroma is coconut, maple buttery rich fudgy bourbon. Taste has a depth of flavors, obviously bourbon coconut maple, butter fudge. The flavors come out throughout the tasting. I have seen some reviews were people qualm about the mouth feel. I think the mouth feel is great it seemed to feel a bit carbonated in the mouth even though there is no sign of carbonation in the glass. The alcohol is so well hidden no smell whatsoever of alcohol Some taste but you would expect that in a beer of this caliber. Provides warming in the chest. Honestly it's so freaking smooth I see almost no need to age this. I'll be the first to admit that Stouts are not my favorite style of beer. This is truly exemplary ,a true world-class treat. I don't think this is the best beer I've ever had but is most certainly the best Barrel aged Stout. It is absolutely delicious it brings beer and the enjoyment of beer to a whole new level.

Booze, oak, fruity from dark berries to sweet dates, leathery, chocolatey, caramel, vanilla, coconut.  T. Chocolate right away with nice boozy bourbon rushing in quickly. Lots of caramel and chocolate flavors, vanilla, toasty coconut, sweet tobacco.  F. Fuller body, really coats the inside of your mouth, a bit warm which is nice.  O. I love candy bars, and this is like an adult candy bar with large notes of chocolate, caramel, vanilla and bourbon. I'm glad I was able to pick a few bottles up this year. Well done. Cheers!   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I've had this beer several times over several years, but have never reviewed it. So today I will review the 2018 release. Bottled Sept. 17, 2018. I always like them fresh anyway. Pouring from a 500 ml. bottle into a goose island tulip (that I seem to only use this day each year, let me get the dust off). This beer pours out much lighter in color this year from what I remember of previous years. Despite being heavier in ABV this year (bottle states 15.2%). Forms darker in the glass but still has highlights. Forms a very active and quickly dissipating crown. The smell is huge boozy dark fruit like raisins, plums, digs and black cherries mixing with oak and slight chocolate. People saying this year is dark fruit heavier compared to other years, but just going off of smell this is what I think of when I think of bourbon county. The taste comes in with smooth chocolate and slight vanilla before leaning on the dark fruit side of things. Tobacco element as well with some char notes. The mouthfeel coats with the sugar sweet notes while being dry from the oak and leaving a char like element behind. I love this beer but feel like a lot are coming for it. It's not such a standout anymore among barrel aged beers, even though it paved the way. The one key difference in it to me is the char element it always has vs. finding that in other stouts. But other than that, it's becoming more of a nostalgia beer rather than a I truly have to chase this because of the quality compared to others beer. Just the way the world turns I guess. Not a bad thing.

Dark chocolate, dark fruit, vanilla, oak, whiskey and tobacco. Easy drinking for 14%. This is one of the best beers I’ve ever had.

Nose is whiskey, coffee, some dark chocolate, wood, and cola on the back. Taste begins as chocolate, quickly fading to bourbon which gives way to black licorice, soy sauce. No heat though bourbon bitterness lingers. Mouthfeel is thick and milky, drying quickly. Overall the black licorice and soy sauce notes hurt this for me. There's plenty of good going on but enough as there should be. I guess I sat on this one too long.

Half finger of it that fades to a ring.     Boozy raisins, burnt coffee, vanilla extract, smoky red wine, charred oak, and of course, bourbon.     Italian roast Starbucks instant coffee, black strap molasses, sweet bourbon, and it’s all very sweet. The finish is charred coffee, charred oak, and surprisingly clean.     Motor oil describes this beer to a tee. It’s thick and viscous.     I thought I’d reviewed this once before, but I guess not. It’s very good. Thick, sticky, sweet, smoky, and bourbon flavored.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 2017 Bottle    Pours a thick, black color. The head was minimal, but a nice shade of brown. Retention was poor.   The nose is rich with notes of chocolate, vanilla, and notes of the barrel.   Taste - Is rich. Got some vanilla, chocolate. A nice warming heat on the backside.   Full bodied, and a nice feel of the barrel.  This is a world class beer, and third time I've had it, world class every time.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Pours a pitch black coloration with a small creamy head. Incredible aroma of bourbon, chocolate and vanilla. Taste follows the nose, with a rich, but not overpowering bourbon flavor backed by lots of chocolate, some vanilla and molasses. There's a very slight boozyness to it, but it's such a nice shade of bourbon that it's not unpleasant at all. Great, creamy, velvety mouthfeel. This is without a doubt the second best stout I have ever tasted.

Unfortunately, I did not have a snifter. I may have lost some aroma and risked drinking it too fast, but it is still very good. I know Goose Island is no longer a proper craft brewery, but they still make good beer.      Look: jet-black with a one-inch mocca head.    Aroma: roasted malts, smokey, chocolate, bourbon    Taste: It's sweet, syrupy caramel, and roasted malts, smokey, chocolate, a little bit of coffee, and lots of bourbon. It's a bit boozy, but not in a bad way.    Feel: full bodied, slightly boozy, silky   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2017 release  16.9 oz bottle poured into a snifter.     Dark brown like crude oil it lets a bit of light through and leaves a nice slick residue on the glass. As if to warn of the high ABV the medium brown head is thin and leaves only spotty lacing amongst the ample legs of alcohol.     The smell of alcohol is not as high as I would have guessed and the mellow notes of caramel and bourbon are rather soothing. There is also a touch of soy sauce and and a constant but subdued aroma of vanilla. The alcohol while present is not a detractor.     The taste, as well as being damn good reflects the nose well. Sweet caramel and warm bourbon front to back with a small amount of soy sauce are constant. I get a light sweetness and sometimes raisin or prune but very light. The finish is smooth and warming. No oak flavor but I do get some charred wood character in the aftertaste.    Mouth feel is good too. Thick and soft it has a little bit of viscosity and not much carbonation. It seems to get any bite that it has from the alcohol.    This is what I handed over my money for. Very good Imperial.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 This was the 2017 bottle, I have a 2015 but holding off on that one.  The look is pitch black with an ever so slight tinge of brown.  The smell is bourbon, duh, with a hint of smoke.  Taste is amazing, the bourbon doesn’t punch you like a lot of bourbon barrel aged stouts. It’s smooth, with vanilla hints. The after taste is that perfect bourbon burn. It lets you know you’ve just had something very good,  Feel is smooth with just a hint of burn at the nd.  Overall this is an amazing beer.  I’m not a big fan of the Goose IPAs, but I’m totally a fan of this,   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Look- Black. Nice cm of tan head    Smell- Nice silky smooth chocolate. Boozy scent is there but balanced rather well    Taste- BA stouts can easily.go tilt. Silkiness if the Cocoa balances very well with the whiskey barrel. Smooth is an adept word    Feel- on point. Not too thin, not to thick. Goes down well    Overall- Nice flavor. Appropriate level of whiskey. This is an ever evolving brewing style. Many love the BA stouts. I am Jekyl and Hyde. If it's great I love it. If it's unbalanced,.I'm it's biggest critic. Too many do too much.to differentiate themselves. GI understands balance. Great batch

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 Appearance: jet black as usual. nice khaki head. head lingers around edges and clings (this one's a glass stainer, but you'll be sure to finish it before that happens.)  Smell: Almost like a very dark wine and a good bourbon.  Taste: HEAVY molasses. Nice bourbon bite to it to offset the molasses though. Little bit of burnt chocolate that works very well with the rest of the elements. Nice malts to it. Not overly sweet, the bourbon, chocolate and molasses flavors balance each other out.  Mouthfeel: lingering. it feels thick around the mouth even well after the last sip. the flavor sticks in your mouth for a while.   Overall: would highly recommend but you already know that. Everyone should try it!

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5 A - Jet black pour, dark tan head but less than I expected. Very clingy residue and tints the glass.  S - Malty, molasses forward, bourbon, somewhat boozy.  T - Still heavy on the molasses and roasted malts, but this was hotter than the smell indicated. After the sweetness fades, the rest of the flavors really come out. Malts, slight hops, chocolate, bourbon, burned something.  M - Thick, coating, carb level was a little lower than I would have liked.  O - I was surprised that the bourbon was not more forward, but overall, this is something incredible. The amount of refinement that has gone into the 2017 release shows and I think it's been nearly 20 years since it's first release. This is a beer that I'll actively seek out, but won't have to for a little bit since I was lucky enough to get 24!   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Bottled Aug 2017, into snifter.    I gotta say I’m loving this a lot more than last year’s release (and mine weren’t infected). It’s a beautiful beer. Starting with the presentation - I love this bottle. It really communicates that a special elixir lies within.   The pour is just what you’d expect, plus the unique and lovely dark brownish-orange looking head that fizzes out quickly to the edges of the glass.   As opposed to last year’s super heavy vanilla and caramel notes, I’m getting a lot more dark chocolate, coffee bean, sweet bourbon, and charred oak - followed by a even helping of caramel and a hint of vanilla - and back to that nice charred woody character with the slightest hints of super ripe stone fruit. This brew masterfully and distinctly touches on all those flavors you expect out of an imprrial barrel aged stout and then exceeds that.   This is so smooth. It hides the 14%abv behind a wholesome, chewey, and perfectly carbonated brew that continues to lightly fizz on your tongue to the last gulp. Finishes with a small bit of heat that truly elevates the whole experience.  Seriously guys, Goose Island is still on top of their game with this one.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 I'll dare to review this one. I've had exactly one of this particular beer, a 2017 sample, and it was really great. And that's all I'm going to get for awhile as 1 was the limit at the place I got it. Life seems so unfair sometimes.    I'd start with the bottle/label design, which I think is inspired. A perfect match for the beer found within. Imagine what it must taste like from looking at the bottle. That is what it tastes like. The beer comes with quite the pedigree, and I had some idea what it would be like, and it was pretty much exactly as I expected. Perhaps the finish was a bit of a surprise, but it is very much the sweet, molasses, malty, alcoholic, smooth, barrely beer that you've heard about and it looks like. The dark translucent liquid that clings to the sides of the bottle are a tip-off of the imperial stout/malty goodness contained within. I don't need to drink beer anymore, I can just look at it in the bottle and go "ahhhh!".    But seriously, this starts out molasses forward, becoming complex molasses/malty/alcohol, and finishing a bit on the bitter, hoppy side. A terrific ride, really. You get the dark fruity flavors and a strong dose of bourbon barrel flavor. The 14% ABV is a bit eye opening, but it works well. It is not completely hidden, but does enhance the flavors of all stages, from the initial sweet impression through the hoppy after taste.    Actually, I'm wondering how legal this brew is. It is so good, it must be addictive. I had one bottle, and I need to go into rehab. How many bottles can I get for the house?   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 This is my first glass of 2017. I am a BA stout fan and get my hands on anything I can find. I have to say that by far this is one of the best I have ever had. I love the raisony prune taste. It smells as good as it tastes. The stickyness on the lips. The obvious bourbon undertones. It makes many of the other BA stouts taste like amateur hour. It is so well balanced. I wish I had cases tucked away. 1 bottle down and 7 to go!

TASTE: Closely follows the nose: dark fruit, cherry, vanilla, mellow and nicely integrated bourbon presence. Everythings here melds beautifully.     Two years aging has cooled this beer down a lot, melded the flavors so that experience is coherant and complex without heat or bourbon overpowering the more subtle notes. Fantastic beer.

Jet black with oil top/hue, looks like molasses on top. Smell very sugary and bitter notes, mostly a burnt ash scent mixed with artificial chocolate. A lot of the alcohol is rising out of the glass. Taste is a dark chocolate at first that evolves to a sweet charred caramel and flan taste that is absolutely lovely. I get very smokey notes with toasted marshmallow, flan, campfire, s'mores, faint cherry, and charred oats. Mouthfeel is also quite pleasant, very mellow and refreshing, this beer is incredible. You don't even notice the 15%, which is very dangerous. Overall, this beer blows me away. I experienced things that I expect from an expensive Whiskey, and it is refreshing and enjoyable. I wish I had more.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 So I originally gave this beer a 4.04, but that was because I had the 14.1% abv version. Now drinking 14.7% abv version it makes huge difference. 1st let's look at 4.03 rating of 14.1% with both poured into cellar and at cellar temp:    Not bad but don't understand the hype. Much better bourbon stouts exist these days. Perhaps it was something years back before the bourbon barrel craze. Its good but never will i chase again.   As far as flavors go I get bourbon and dark fruit but is a bit watered down. Just too many better bourbon barrel stouts these days. This one lacks flavor and depth and will never seek this one out again. For what you get there is definitely better cheaper options that taste better.    Now 14.7% abv version:    L: Dark as night, thin head that dissipates quickly, super syrupy thick.    A: bourbon barrel, dark fruit,vanilla, and chocolate     F: thick slow sipper that blasts you with bourbon yet super smooth with a generous bourbon bite on backend.    T: bourbon, dark fruit, vanilla, chocolate, just straight up delicious     O: I understand there are abv laws that would not allow a 14.7% abv but my answer to that is get those bills dismissed. This beer needs to be 14.7% abv all the time as it makes huge difference in flavor.

A finger and a half of light brown head that fades to nothing and leaves a faint lacing.  S: Bourbon, dark fruit, molasses, vanilla, dark chocolate, oak, smoke and a touch of coffee.  T: The bourbon is much milder than the smell and blends perfectly with a delicious blend of sweet vanilla, strong coffee, bitter chocolate, plum, fig and smoke with bourbon and oak in the finish. The alcohol is amazingly well incorporated with a slight warming at the end.  M: Slightly chewy and sticky with medium carbonation.   O: Wow! They knocked it out of the park with this one in 2017. Need to go get more to see what aging will do.

AROMA: Big bourbon, molasses, tobacco, woody vanilla, bit smoky, and chocolate. Smells great.  TASTE: The flavors are SO well blended here. Everything I mentioned in the aroma, but, the bourbon is more in check, in the flavor. But, it builds on the palate as I continue to drink; very nice!!  FEEL: A little sticky, dry on finish, full bodied, average carbonation.   OVERALL: Just perfectly blended. My first one, and I can see why this is so popular. Awesome stuff.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Arrived home a couple days ago to discover my roommate had acquired (for free!) a bottle of 2016 vintage BCBS. Needless to say I was surprised. Appearance is that of a high-ABV stout: quickly dissipating brown head, pitch black appearance, and alcohol legs up the wazoo. Aroma and flavor profiles are largely dominated by rich chocolate and bourbon notes, with layers of candied dark fruits, oak, caramel, vanilla, and barley malts. The minimal carbonation prevents the mouthfeel from being totally velvety, but it is very mouth-coating nonetheless.    90/100    EDIT (12/1/2017):  Had the 2017 release with some friends. Pretty similar to the 2016, except this year's version has a much more significant dark brown head that sticks around for a little while. The bourbony char character is really prevalent    EDIT (10/9/18):  Snagged a chance bottle of 2017 at the Fort Point Market a little while back. It's been a while since I last had BCBS and revisiting it I'm as impressed as before. Really rich, barrel-filled aromas and flavors, a nice thick mouthfeel, and some really interesting smoky/caramely nuances. Looking forward to the 2018 batch   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 2015 and 2017 vintage side by side:    2017: Pours a dark black with a tan head that disappears instantly. Smells of dark roasted malts, chocolate, bourbon, wood, tons of vanilla, and molasses. Tastes of strong vanilla bean, bourbon, wood, sweet chocolate, some bitterness, light coffee, molasses, booze, and very light licorice. Heavy body and light carbonation.    2015: Same in look and feel. The smell has less vanilla. The taste also has less vanilla, more bitterness, less sweetness, and a little more alcohol.    Overall this is an absolutely incredible barrel aged imperial stout. I prefer the 2017, however they were both excellent. 4.25 for the 2015 and 4.5+ for the 2017.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 From notes taken 05/10/17:    I really wish I could get my hands on some of the special once-brewed variants of this beer. One of these days, I'm sure.    Bottled October 6th 2016, so it’s a good seven months old. My intention was always to wait for at least six although if I had been able to pick up a few more than four of these I would have liked to have reviewed it fresh as well. Three more to go, in this batch at least. I’m thinking next reviews will be two years from bottling, then 3-5, then perhaps more than 5 years although it says best aged up to 5.    Dark brown to black, seems opaque and where thin enough to be semi-clear there is a definite fine haze. Rich orange-brown head, one finger and fine and foamy, but very quickly gone. Smells like a raisin-spice cake, made with rum or brandy or bourbon, and a hint of licorice. And that’s just in the bottle still. In glass, more licorice, almost banana-nut cake, some dark chocolate, faintest roastiness, and I can begin to detect ever-increasing overt oaky bourbon notes, burns my nose after a while. No vanilla yet apart from what oak has imparted. But now, on the pallet, I’d say it’s one of the main flavors, more than is distinct bourbon, more than anything else that comes standard in a stout. Vanilla and faint dark chocolate and a hint of dried or dark fruit tartness up front and throughout, followed quickly with the addition of pure booze, stronger chocolate, light licorice, and the faintest deteriorated hops, which is good here for the balance, though might be responsible for detracting from more distinct bourbon notes. Finish is molasses to the maximum, sweet and dark and rich. Overall, booziness is closer to brandy, fortified wine, or spiced rum. Full-bodied, oily, viscous, creamy, smooth. Carbonation is fine and gentle but does spritz up a little as ale is sloshed over the teeth and tongue. Extremely hot but mostly in nasa passage and on tongue, the texture must be such that the lips, throat, and cheeks remain unburnt. Overall, a treat, but almost too much of one. Very sweet, very alcoholic. I’ve had less than a third of it, and combined with the other two beers I’ve hd so far today, I must set it aside for later. Just barely the best Stout of any kind I have ever had, and there were a few non-barrel-aged ones, albeit still imperials, that almost beat it out. Based on what else is still out there, I’d wager there are better ones still, whether strictly imperial or any number of barrel-aged variations.

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 I was thankful to find a bottle of this on the East Coast that I could bring back to enjoy with my wife in Los Angeles. It has the year 2015 written in handwriting.  From the bottle it pours almost flat. It sits there calmly like a well aged Belgian quad, with almost no head or rising bubbles. It is black but the light shines through the thin corner edges to reveal a red-brown tint.  Aroma is interesting and complex consisting of heavy bourbon barrel character, figs and dates, warm fruit, molasses, vanilla, some warm spice like cinnamon or nutmeg, not much coffee or chocolate. Again, a little reminiscent of a Belgian quad but without that characteristic Belgian yeast character.  Taste initially pretty much follows the nose, packaged in an oily and slick and resinous body. As it warms and breathes, milk chocolate notably and surprisingly makes itself prominent. I can’t say the finish is sweet or bitter. Just balanced. Alcohol is noticeable but not unwelcome.  A drinking experience to which I hope to be able to return one day.

Ages very well too.

Taste is similar, bourbon, oak, and roasted malt. Alcohol tingles briefly on the end.  Full bodied, thick, syrupy stout which I enjoy. I can see why this is considered a benchmark by which other BA stouts are measured, forget the line at Best Buy, I'll be in line waiting on my local bottle shop to open Black Friday!

I have to say it's the best stout I've ever had. It has a very high abv, but with the bourbon, chocolate and coffee flavors the alcohol is nicely distant. This was the best beer I had on a 2 week trip through the southeastern U.S..

Bottled on September 20, 2016. 13.8% ABV.    Look: Jet black, thin head of tan foam, quickly  dissipating.  Smell: On the sweeter side, but full of chocolate with a coffee finish. Hints of caramel and dried fruit.  Taste: Thick and hearty, heavier on the chocolate with really no booze burn but a slight bourbon flavor on the back. A little malty, complimenting the bitterness of the even coffee notes found in the beer. Still getting that subtle sweetness, with hints of dried cherries and plums.  Feel: pretty heavy body. Sticky and awesome, with a very slight carbonation level.    The final beer in an incredible tasting lineup for the day. All so distinctly different, but I truly feel that this was really the epitomization of the imperial stout style; balanced with malt, chocolate, and coffee. An amazing finish to this day.

So perhaps a little aging would mellow out the twinge. Frankly, I don't mind it. And it's a consistent pour when I'm looking for a stout to do the job. Anytime I see this for sale, I'll reload. It's a great beer. *Craft or not.

look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Look: Poured super dark black with little to no head, even with a pretty harsh pour.    Smell: Bourbon and oak up front, but closely followed by dark fruits (maybe cherries) and then vanilla and some caramel. This thing smells delicious.     Taste: Everything is present and blends well together. A lot of times the bourbon takes over these types of beers, and even though I don't mind that because I am a bourbon drinker, I think being able to impart bourbon on a beer without it dominating is the best case scenario. This beer has bourbon and oak there but its still sweet with the vanilla and caramel and it definitely has dark fruits in there as well.     Feel: This thing is definitely full-bodied and super smooth. Pretty easy to drink at its abv with no bitterness and no aftertaste.     Overall: I am really loving this beer at the moment. This might be the best blend of flavors from a BA beer I have ever had, that still had a really great bourbon feel to it. This definitely goes into the permawant category and I will be searching it out at the next release.

Strong smells of bourbon as soon as the bottle was opened, also notes of chocolate and vanilla. Tastes of bourbon, roasted malts, chocolate, a hint of coffee, and finishes with vanilla. Primary flavor is bourbon with a slight alcohol burn to it, not unpleasant and certainly not as strong as some BA beers, but noticeable. Feel is creamy and flavor lingers a while on the palette. Overall a very nice BA stout though coming off a winter where I sampled many others, this is solid but there are many like it or better.

S: Good gawd this is wonderful. Mission figs and dried stone fruit with a bourbon backbone. After a few minutes, the fruit dies down and the bourbon takes over.  T: Mild roasty bitterness underneath a bourbon-forward flavor. There are hints of chocolate and coffee bean with a burnt sugar sweetness, but mainly is straightforward bourbon stout goodness.  F: About average viscosity for a bourbon IS. Thick enough, but certainly not thick for the style. This hides 13% incredibly well.   O: Fantastic beer. You just can't go wrong with this.

This is the 2016 version with 4 months of age at room temperature in the south (perfect). Smells like bourbon barrels and dark fruit. Very easy drinking stout with no bitterness, just dark fruit and slightly sweet bourbon and vanilla. Slight carbonation makes for easy sippin. I like it a lot for a very sophisticated stout that sips a lot like a fortified wine. The bourbon barrel leaves a very clean taste complimenting the dark fruit, vanilla flavors. I am amazed how nicely this is crafted.

I figured that if since I was stuck inside during “The Blizzard of 2017”, I would drink one of my stock. Deep thick dark brown almost black. Night time in a glass. Dense brown head took some time to develop to a little over 1 finger. Dissipated too quickly, leaving no lacing.  Nose – very strong bourbon in front of coffee, dark fruits, and chocolate. Bourbon dominates, which is quite pleasant.   First taste is of vanilla surrounded by caramel. Chocolate and coffee follow through with a finish of licorice, cherry and (of course) bourbon. Flavors improve immensely upon warming.  Dry mouthfeel – minimal carbonation. Glides smoothly and heavily across the tongue. Slight alcohol burn in the back with a finish of sweet bourbon.  Overall a wonderful bourbon barrel stout. From what I recall, the aging of this beer has made it smoother. Glad I have more bottles of 2015 for next year and beyond. CHEERS!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 I have on hand a vertical from '11 - '16 and sampled sequentially on the Friday following Thanksgiving, 2016. I've decided to review only the '11 for now, but if you'd like my notes from the other vintages, feel free to contact me. I plan on doing this annually, so it will be interesting to compare notes on a particular vintage from year to year. The 2011 BCBS was a 14.5% ABV.    Poured like oil from a 12oz bottle stored boxed in my cellar. Little to no head with mild carbonation. The nose hits you before you finish pouring. Heavy bourbon notes with a mild alcohol aggression that was much more mellow than I expected. Plenty of chocolate & roasted malt. It was the most complex nose of any that we tried & was the benchmark for all that followed.     This is an impeccably well produced beer. Flavor profiles had married beautifully, one not trying to outdo another, rather working harmoniously to deliver a smooth crafted beer. Carmel notes, plenty of bourbon, a bit of smoke (probably from the malt or the barrels). Truly just an extraordinarily well balanced beer.     Finished as smooth as it started on the front end, no lingering alcohol notes to disturb the complexities left behind. Lots of chocolate notes on the back end that linger and leave you smacking your tongue trying to savor what's left.     I'm sitting on 5 bottles, willing to part with up to 3 if interested in a trade. Additionally, willing to trade up to 5 of the '12.

Taste is seriously intense. Lots of boozy fruitiness which I did not expect. Bourbon is there and slaps you in the face. Some leather notes and a seriously late bitterness kick. Very smooth mouthfeel.

It's a strong dark bourbon cask flavor with chocolate and vanilla.

I can hear it fizzing away, I don’t like that. The body is just completely black, even when held up to the light. We’ll see how the lacing goes, because the head disappeared all too quickly. So far it looks ok.    By the nose I’m pretty sure I wont like this beer. I just can’t handle all this damn soy sauce. Umami Umami and more Umami. I wouldn’t call this an off flavor, or a bad flavor, I just can’t stand it for the most part. Anyways, other than that there is a substantial woody aroma. Perhaps a little bitter chocolate. Some very nice caramel and vanilla coming through once I agitate it. Syrupy on the nose as well, as would be expected with 13%. I’m not really sure how to grade this. There are nice parts, and again, nothing that I would classify as “off”. I’ll say 4, I can’t knock it too far based on my personal preferences.    Damn, that is one hell of a flavor. Sweet caramel up front. Bitter and boozy as well, but not over the top, they are supporting flavors. I wanted to say cherries on the nose, but I didn’t get that aroma enough, I feel like that is definitely here on the flavor though. A little chocolate hanging out in the background. Very syrupy, but not in a fake way, just super thick and sweet. Surprisingly there is barely any Umami or woodiness. Really just a super complex and amazingly good flavor. It’s hard to pull everything out because so much is going on. Finishes with a little burnt malt, and then a long lingering butterscotch. Maybe some plum/dark fruit going on as well.    The mouthfeel is…interesting. As stated there is a substantial syrup characteristic that comes through just as heavily on the feel as it did on the flavor. Thing is, I don’t know if this is a good thing or not. It definitely adds character to the beer, and I don’t dislike it, which is more than I can say for extremely sweet beers. We’ll just call it a wash. The carbonation is very low. Somewhat dry and bitter for how sweet it also is, well balanced on the flavor and the mouthfeel. It’s not perfect, but it’s a well balanced mouthfeel, with character.    I would like to give this beer a 5 for drinkability, because for 13% it deserves it. Unfortunately that’s not really how drinkability works. So, I’ll say a solid 4, all things considered. It go’s down damn well, but damn well for 13 %.    Overall this is a great beer, the flavor really surprised me, it’s darn good. A little bit of that soy sauce started coming through as it warmed, but overall, great beer.    The appearance was probably the one bad part of this beer, the head was fizzing from the start, and disappeared very quickly. I also got zero lacing, not too great.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Since I recently reviewed BA Ten Fidy somewhat negatively against BCBS, I thought it would be only fair to review BCBS on its own, just to make sure that my memory of the beer isn’t tainted by nostalgia. I was lucky enough to find a hidden stash at a local bottle shop two months after release, so here goes with the ’16 version.    Appearance: yup, I’m reminded why I always go back to this beer as a BA stout reference point. Deep, fudgy brown with a single-finger head that dissipates into a beautiful film across the top of the beer. It’s not showy or overly fluffy, just . . . elegant. The smell is exactly matched to the appearance, offering heady chocolate, vanilla, fig, and bourbon notes that make you realize that most adjunct stouts are basically trying to replicate what base BCBS does without having to add anything. Again, balance and refinement rule the day. Taste is complex and ever-changing as it warms: sweet vanilla evolves into a charred and bourbony chocolate that, in turn, drops into something approaching a deep, fudge liqueur. The journey through the bottle is like tasting three to four different world-class stouts, all of which are flawless. Mouthfeel is rich, oily, and viscous, what BA Ten Fidy wishes it could be. Every sip is like dessert, a decadent treat you want to never end.    Overall, what more can I say? The only thing that keeps me from ruling this BCBS a “perfect” beer is that, as good as the mouthfeel is, it’s been slightly better in previous years. I’ll always remember 2012, which honestly felt like warm brownie batter on the tongue. Obviously, this beer hardly needs my recommendation, but if you’re at all on the fence about trying to obtain and taste it, you’re crazy. It’s the beer to try before you die.

I was in Chicago around Thanksgiving 2014 & I stopped in at Binney's (Clybourn) to try & score some CANs, et al, but the place was such an absolute zoo that I walked out, empty handed & disgusted. It is just one example among many of why I started The CANQuest (tm) in the first place.     From the bottle: "The original bourbon barrel aged Stout"; "Since 1992"; "Stout aged in bourbon barrels"; "Chicago Made Imperial Stout"; "Intense aromas of charred oak, vanilla, caramel & smoke"; Brewed, barrel aged & bottled by Goose Island Beer Co. Chicago, Illinois"; "Develops in the bottle up to 5 years"; "[signed] Brewmaster, Jared Jankowski".    I Pop!ped the cap on the relatively big bottle and commenced a gentle pour simply because I have never had a bottle of BCBS. Usually, I go to PHL during Thanksgiving weekend & have some on tap. This was a new experience for me. I am becoming proficient at doing an in-glass swirl, this time raising a finger of foamy, deep-brown head that seemed rather anxious to fall back to wisps. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44) allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose had the coconut smell that I always seem to get from bourbon, accompanied by dark chocolate, light smoke and caramel. It was a liquefied Girl Scout Samoa cookie! Oh, I am a sucker for them & Thin Mints. This was gonna send me, especially at 13.8% ABV. Mouthfeel was thick, viscous, oily, like BP had dumped a load off of a rig into my mouth. Mmmm. The taste was much like a Samoa with the chocolate leading the way, followed closely by coconut and caramel as well as light smoke. OMFG! This was quite tasty and dangerously easy to drink. I can only imagine how much easier it would become with age. No wonder I just satisfy myself with draft offerings. I have plenty of beer at home without adding to the backlog.

Pours pitch black with maybe a quarter inch of dark brown head that quickly disappears.     Straigh from the fridge the aroma is all bourbon with lots of hot alcohol. Once the beer spends a few minutes in the glass the Bourbon calms down a bit; I then get vanilla, a low-moderate alcohol heat, and subtler bakers chocolate and dark fruits in the background.    The first flavor I get is dark fruits, that is joined by a mix of vanilla, dark and bakers chocolates, and some alcohol heat.    Body is full with low carbonation and slick, heavy sweetness.    Objectively this is a very good Bourbon barrel aged stout. That being said, it makes me realize that I'm not a BBA stout fan. It's still tasty and enjoyable but has just a bit too much heat for the aromas and flavors to be super enjoyable. I have another bottle that I'll hold onto for a year or two in the hopes that the bourbon barrel character mellows a bit.

I don't think I have ever used the word velvet before in a sentence.  So yes , it is velvet.  Keeps getting better so drink it slow.  Overall is good enough to share and really enjoy or act like you can't find a frind and have it all by yourself.

It is topped with less than an inch of tan head that disappears quickly leaving virtually no lacing.     It smells like a bourbon dessert. I smell chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and roasted malt.    The taste is every bit as good. The bourbon melds into caramel and vanilla flavors, while the roasted malt yields chocolate notes. The bourbon is still recognizable in the finish with a mild booze flavor.    Full, smooth, and viscous mouthfeel    This is my first BCBS. I get the hype now. It is a phenomenal beer. It met and perhaps exceeded my high expectations. This is a rare beer that lives up to the hype. It is definitely the best ABI product that I have ever had narrowly beating out Busch heavy.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A still, ebony lake Is lined with a quiet rim of contrasting beige froth. Serene and full of promise.,The aroma is unsurprisingly oaky and smoky with plenty of complementary vanilla and hazelnut, but surprisingly peppery as well! The complex foundation is built of plums, figs, And milk chocolate. Both balanced and full. As Mary Poppins would say, practically perfect in every way. So, let's taste it! The bourbon's woodsy sweetness comes through straight away. It mixes with fresh maple syrup, whose stickiness is balanced by the drying characteristics of tobacco laced with cocoa powder. Soft pastes of plum, dark cherry, and strawberry create a real complex jam. Unlike other bourbon barrel stouts, this is a beast with a real heart. The mouthfeel is smooth jazz creamy with a light carbonic bite toward the finish to let the juice burst just enough for a celenaratory kick. A surprising jewel from an iconic brewery which is apparently still on top of the saturated craft game.

S: Aromas of coffee, vanilla, bourbon, cola, dark chocolate, caramel, sweet and toasted malts, licorice, raisins, cherries, and other dark fruits.    T: Taste follows the nose somewhat. Leads with sweet caramel and cola followed by bitter dark chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. Finishes with notes of cherry, raisins, licorice, and toasted malts with a slight lingering bitterness.     F: Full bodied, medium thickness, creamy, and smooth with a small amount of carbonation.    O: Overall, this is a great BA Stout. This was my first time trying this one. The flavor profile is very complex and interesting. Lots going on in this one. At first, I felt it was overly sweet, but as it started to warm it began to balance out the sweetness and fruitiness with coffee and bourbon. Only wish I would have had time to sit and let it warm longer. Great BA stout and I'm looking forward to cracking one of my bottles to see if there is any difference.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 2015 vintage dated 10/1/15.    A: Beer comes in a pitch black color with pretty much no head retention save for the thinnest little ring of tiny mocha bubbles. Major alcohol legs staining the glass.     S: Very bourbon-forward, definitely the most intensely bourbon-y nose I've experienced. Lots of vanilla, oak, smoke, and dark fruits, mostly cherry. Little bit of dark chocolate and caramel as well. Extremely pungent as expected.    T: Wow. Huge dark fruits and vanilla up front, followed by nearly as intense notes of caramel, dark chocolate, oak, and burnt brown sugar. Even some molasses on the aftertaste. It's so complex, with each flavor coming in a wave that unapologetically attacks the palate. There's a lot of sweetness, but not too much, as the drying alcoholic note really cuts through it on the finish. As it warms, I get a little soy sauce-y thing on the finish,    M: Really slick, almost oily mouthfeel that just glides across the tongue. Not particularly full due to lack of carbonation, but feels heavy on the tongue. Burning alcoholic sensation in the back of the throat, but this isn't nearly as boozy as the 13.7% would suggest.     O: I'm still making my way into the barrel-aged stout world, but this was definitely a step in the right direction. This beer packs a TON of flavor into a deservedly large package, and the flavor profile is one of the more complex I've experienced in a beer. While the nose is somewhat lacking IMO (too barrel- and dark fruit-forward), the taste is a wonderful melange of vanilla, chocolate, dark fruit, caramel, molasses, and oak. I look forward to revisiting this as I build my appreciation for the style, but as it stands now, I think it's quite delicious!   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Usually I pass on these beers when they release but this year it was pretty much talked up into my bag even though I didn't ask about it but my usual beer place guy told me people always fought over it so I figured why the hell not.    This beer is the blackest of the black. People throw around the words motor oil all the time, but this is the closest to motor oil I have ever seen. No head.    The bourbon is ever apparent alongside the oak. There is a dark fruitiness on the nose that you cannot deny. This is probably my least favorite part of the beer.    At first, the taste hits you with that immediate sweetness, but it quickly envelopes into vanilla and bakers chocolate sweetness which surrounds and dominates the mouth and throat, with oak coming in to match.    The feel is boozy and oaky with a touch of creaminess and lower carbonation. Swallows sweet and just a touch boozy depending on how big of a sip you take.    Overall, if they could kill that initial odd sweetness but keep the rest of the flavors, this could potentially be my favorite beer of all time. This is world class, and I'm not one to rate on hype nor anything else aside from how much I enjoyed it. Aging will do it well, but fresh is out of this world too.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Let this one warm up a bit after pouring it, the flavours really kick your pallets ass.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 1 | feel: 1 | overall: 2 I don't think I've ever had a beer taste this bad. It was very thick and tasted kind of rotten.

The color was very dark and it smelled like a stout and sour mixed together.

No surprise but an amazing brew. Wow!

Deep roast, rich chocolatey thats more on the bittersweet side. I'm getting some slight berry tanginess in there too, before that huge boubon barrel taste. The end is a big hint of alcohol. I'm getting a little bit of a Coca Cola flavor too     This was my first time having this. I bought two and am going to save one for next year to experience some mellowing. The beer right now is pretty bold and robust. There's some smoothness for sure but the bitter chocolate and dark berries make it pretty vibrant.

This is the 10/21/2015 14.3 ABV version. After having many barreled aged stouts, I can see why this is the Platinum standard.    Look - Pitch black. Looks like motor oil. Half finger of mocha head. Goes away quickly.    Smell- Dark rich Plums and Berries, Vanilla, Oak, Smoke and some pine!!!    Taste fallows the nose.- Big dark strong fruits and berries, Vanilla, light smoke.     Feel- Thick sticky mouth feel, Very warming.But very very drinkable. Would love as a night cap.     Overall- I have never had a other version prior to this. But this beer has probably ruined any other barrel aged stout for me. The flavors are so complex. I came in to this very unbiassed. I kinda figured with so many other bourbon barrel aged stouts, that would average. But damn, I was wrong.     I am aware of the 2015 batch infection. Don't know if since this bottle was kept cold in a fridge helped. But I am glad my first taste of this brew passed my expectations!!!!!

Has the sweet bourbon flavor you would expect from a barrel aged brew which also gives the little tingling sensation on the tip of your tongue. Was contemplating sharing this beer, though honestly I'm glad that I kept it for myself during some alone time. When I poured this in to my glass a was so pleased to see such a deep dark color that not even holding it up to a light could pierce.

Recently had 2012 and 2013, which would rate similarly (2012 was a little more bourbon heavy). Haven't had them recently, but 2014 would be a little higher (more chocolate/fudge base) while 2015 would be a little lower (less balanced, basically caramel and bourbon, not obviously infected).     L- Basically black, slightly brownish tinge. Slight mocha colored head, but it fades to a thin ring that eventually disappears.    S- Bourbon is the most prominent. Some vanilla and chocolate.     T- Like the smell, quite a bit of bourbon in the flavor. It's supplemented by milk chocolate, caramel and a little vanilla. A little sweet, especially when it warms, but not enough to ding it.     F- Medium-low carb, which works for this beer. Smooth, rich but not super thick. Some alcohol burn on the finish.     O- An old standby, especially in Chicago. Very tasty, especially if you like bourbon. It's probably not worth the lines, but it's better than a lot of barrel-aged stouts that cost more (BCBS is fairly easy to get at $9.99 for 16.9 oz).

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 12 oz bottle dated 29 August 2014 served in a Belgian snifter in December 2016. Revisited in March 2018 with a 2017 version on tap in Florida. Revisited in July 2018 with a 2014 bottle in GA.     Removing the cap indicated a secure seal, but this has very little carbonation. This is not ideal for the appearance, but the low carbonation seems about right for the smooth, full, warming, high ABV body. Boozy and woody (too woody) aroma with dark roasted grains and molasses. Sweet bourbon dominates the rich flavor that also suggests dark dried fruits including dates. Moderately woody with faint vanilla and coffee in the finish. Mild bourbon barrels and dark bread in the aftertaste. 6 month old version on tap was too hot. Perhaps surprising that I preferred this over the coffee variant in both time variant and back-to-back comparisons.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Had the 2016 version. This could definitely use some age behind it. Initially, the taste is so sweet it's off putting then the sweet winds down and the flavors come through. Maybe with age that sweetness will mellow.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 First had 10/20/14 at The Mint. It was a 2013 Vintage. The flavors come out as it warms in the glass. This love affair has been had many times, and as with this style, the longer they sit in a basement, the better they get. I'm tiring of all the "releases", and tap takeovers at pubs, I try and hunt this down in case form.

look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 2013 version, on tap.    Appearance: Near black, can't see through it when held up to the light. Hints of brown and red as well? Despite an aggressive pour it produces almost no head, which quickly recedes to some slow-moving lace on the side.    Smell: I can definitely smell the alcohol, which is fine; I like bourbon, why do you think I'm drinking a bourbon-aged stout? Dark fruits, cherry, fig. Roast, malt, char. Soy sauce? Something savory.    Taste: Cocoa, but also vanilla. Wood/oak...can that be a taste instead of an aroma? Not that I'm prone to munching on wood or anything. More dark fruits. Bourbon. People often praise big, high ABV stouts for hiding the alcohol. This...doesn't, but it's not bad. It's got the bourbon sweetness. The taste gets better across the middle of the tongue and it leaves a strong aftertaste.    Mouthfeel: Not very carbonated, and I like carbonated. It's the reason I don't like nitro beers. I have to swish it around a bit to feel the bubbles, but they're there. Thick, but not heavy; very pleasant body.     Overall: Does it live up to the hype? Probably. I had this once before when I was drunk and thought it might be one of my favorite beers ever. I hate feeding into the hype, but it's probably deserved.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 I'm enjoying this much more than 2015 or 2014. Actually, I recently opened a cellared 2014 and this is drinking like that - wicked smooth and tasty! My past experiences with fresh BCBS is that it's too 'hot' and bourbon-y for me but that age tempers it nicely. This one is already there. Not sure what, if any, role pasteurization plays in that.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2014 vintage. Drank from the tap out of a tulip glass. Beer pours pitch black with no head. Aggressive swirling produces a small dark brown head. Aroma smacks of bourbon. Super fudgy with big dried cherry and fig aromas jumping out of the glass. Aroma translates to the palate but with a boozy bourbon punch on the finish. Mouthfeel is very thick and fudgy like drinking slightly watered down chocolate syrup. This beer is the benchmark for barrel aged stouts and I can see why. But benchmark doesn't always mean best and I think that the boozyness holds it back a bit. 93.5 points.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 500ml bottle (06OCT16) into snifter left a khaki colored head  - Smells of Charred Oak, Smoky, Vanilla and bourbon  - Tastes very similar to the smell with heavy notes of bourbon and smoke  - Mouth feel is silky smooth and very boozy finish  - Overall, BCS was one of the best beers I have enjoyed in a long time! Being it was the first time I have tried BCS it was well worth the wait (and getting up early on Black Friday)   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 2015 dated 11 Nov. poured into a snifter at about 55 degrees.     Hard por left about a finger of dark khaki head that dissipated quickly.    I was worried that this was infected due to the issues from BCBS 2015 and the nose off the bottle was a little sour smelling. however when after pour with some air was getting Vanillia, charred oak, Bourbon was very pronounced.     Was definatly not infected, An almost perfect blend of vanilla. charred oak, toasted coconut, dark chocolate. Bourbon was there but more in the background complimenting the other flavors. Its crazy how a year or 2 turns this beer into almost perfection.     there are beers that do not live up to the hype machine. if you can score this without a hunt and at a decent price point, it will not dissipoint.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 L: Had this beer on-tap at Closed for Business, poured into a snifter. Had a black color and a thick consistency. There was a small amount of foamy, tan-colored head that quickly dissipated. Not much lacing to speak of.    S: A big, bold aroma of bourbon, a woody quality, vanilla, and some chocolate.    T: Like the smell, the, the taste is a powerful thing: Lots of chocolate, some malt, a big shot of bourbon, the aforementioned bourbon quality, caramel, vanilla, a light smokiness, and some dark fruit. This is a flavor that takes charge. It's complex, aggressive, and tasty.    F: A decent amount of carbonation with a silky smooth, if somewhat boozy finish. Full-bodied.    O: Bourbon County is one of those storied beers that doesn't disappoint. It's well made, drinkable, and easy to like - assuming you enjoy stouts.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a 1 pint bomber,into a Prairie Artisan Ales snifter.  *2013 version*  Poured from a 12 oz bottle,into a Funky Buddha snifter.    Thin,dark brown / khaki head,that dissipated rather quickly.Jet black,with zero light coming through the glass,and no visible carbonation.  *2013 version*  VERY thin brown head that dissolves immediately.DARK black in color,with no light showing through the glass.    The nose is mostly woody bourbon and alcohol.I also am getting some caramel,and some vanilla notes in there as well.As far as the aroma goes,the bourbon is pretty well hidden.  *2013 version*  On the nose I am getting dark fruits,bourbon,caramel,cocoa,coffee,and chocolate.    The palate gives an up front blast of bourbon and oak,followed up by some vanilla and caramel notes.I get very faint hints of dark fruits,and dark roasted malts...But this is a VERY bourbon heavy stout.Nice smokey aftertaste.Little bit of a nutty flavor in there as well.Once the bourbon fades away,there is a distinct sweetness to the aftertaste.  *2013 version*  WOW!!! 4 years of aging served this beer VERY WELL.  The flavors are so abundant,and so complex, I'm having a really hard time pinpointing them all...So I will just name the obvious ones... BOURBON,alcohol,caramel,coffee,toffee,chocolate,andcocoa....Like I said,4 years aging served this beer very well.      The body is medium / thin,with a warming alcohol finish.  *2013 version*  Same as the 2016    I hate bourbon,so I will try to rate this without bias...This brew has pretty much everything going for it except for the bourbon...Leave the bourbon barrel ageing out....You have yourself a fine imperial stout.And to be honest...I really don't mind the bourbon in this one...A fine Imperial Stout.  *2013 version*  Look: 4.5  Smell: 4.5  Taste: 4.75  Feel: 4.50  Overall: 4.75

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 First had from 12-oz. bottle, gift from local restaurateur (at 13.80 ABV, this beer may never become available in Mississippi), label stamped bottled on: "29AUG14 13," poured into snifter. All the big flavors one expects, alcohol better-hidden than seems possible, and not surpassed after all these years.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 BCBS 2016 is right up there with my favorite all time beers. Poured pure black into a snifter with a quick fizzy head. Smell was a delightful burnt cask with a hint of sweetness. First taste was of bourbon with some vanilla added.Yes the booze does come through but with the name of bourbon what can you expect?!   Upset that I only purchased one but I have no way of aging currently.

look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 2016 Bottling. Black as it gets. No light is getting through this sucker. There is a slight wisp of head in the center of the snifter and a single line of tiny bubbles around the perimeter. The aroma, is in a word, perfect. It's got vanilla, it's got a little coffee, a little cocoa, maybe some tobacco from the oak. It's rich and complex but not overwhelming. The taste is exquisite, as well. The vanilla is upfront, there's some straight bourbon following it, and then a little dark roasted coffee. The body is lighter, slick with a little tingle from the alcohol.
