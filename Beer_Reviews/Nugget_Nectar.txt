look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 12 oz can into IPA glass. Dated best by 5/17/19.  Look is fairly clear reddish brown. Smell is fairly light hops/yeast/malt balance. Taste follows nose. Very balanced. Feel is light. Overall a nice beer but I would not seek it out but would drink again.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12-oz. can, Freshest By 05/17/2019. An easy pour creates a finger of light beige froth with long retention and ridges of lacing. Clear deep copper-amber, orange-amber in front of light.  Bright hops; pine, citrus, herbal and spicy greet the nose with some caramel malt and faint alcohol.  Semi-sweet, caramel malt-rich start to the taste with semi-bitter hops. The hop flavors and bitterness increases during the middle with apple and citrus fruit. The finish is fast and clean, a little dry and bitter with the hop flavors lingering for a long aftertaste. Alcohol is hidden during the taste. Medium-full bodied, ample carbonation. Smooth easy drinker. Great looks, smell, taste and feel. Hoppy as all hell yet balanced by the abundance of malt.

I can't say I've ever tried a "Imperial Red Ale" before this...But I loved it!   Solid recommendation.  So much character in a single glass.  Can't wait for my next one!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a translucent amber with two fingers of white foam that retains beautifully well, with a long lingering foam ring. Aroma is pine, resin, citrus, and sticky hops forming a lightly sweet, balanced nose. Bready, earthy, caramel malts round out the remainder of the aroma profile. Flavor profile is pine, resin, citrus, and lightly dank hops for a semi-sweet opening that is balanced out well by malts. Malts are bready, earthy, and caramel. Mouth feel is lightly fuzzy, with a touch of effervescence. It's a little too fuzzy to be 'crisp', but nears that level of refreshment. It has a medium thickness. Overall, balance between hops and malts are fantastic, with both being allowed to shine.     Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle.

I do :) ("Official beer of Oompa Lumpas everywhere!" ??? :P ) . Luxurious off-white head, that persists for awhile, and leaves a good amount of lacing.    Aroma is ruby grapefruit, on the sweet end of the grapefruit spectrum, some sweet, honey-ish toasted malt , and some mango , as promised on the label.    Taste is pine, sweetish grapefruit, bitter-grapefruit pith, and some fruited-mead-like sweet/sour. It finishes with a rounded stab of pine/grapefruit bitterness , on the anterior quarter of the tongue, that lingers for a minute or so.    Feel is moderately oily/creamy, with some very fine carbonation tingle that mixes in, builds, and takes over on the finish.     Overall, very good. Nice balance between the fruity elements, the pine, and the sweetish malt. Smooth, and easy-drinking. The total is greater than the sum of the parts.

Notes of citrus, pine, and resin on the nose. Taste followed aroma, smooth with a crisp finish. Pleasantly surprising with the stated high IBU. Very easy to drink. Lives up to the hype ... though admittedly I did not know there was any hype until a friend/coworker who lived in Hershey prior said I had to try it and gave two cans to sample. I would highly recommend. To bad it is only brewed once a year.

I will cautiously try the 2019 version and hope for the best.

The flavor explodes and this hoppy brew starts well and finishes even better. The IBU is 93ish, but well hidden in this delightful brew. BUT, it is a brewed ONCE A YEAR, so get it when it is available. Straw/orange in color, this beer pours great out of the bottle. Love this one in a snifter. Great pine and mango flavor will leave you coming back for a second one. A great complement to any meal. Once again, the Troeg Brothers have produced a must try!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pale amber color, brilliantly clear. Poured good sized just off white head with good retention.    A bit malty caramel sweet, and a complex hop nose with some citrus and pine. Hop aroma fairly intense.    Big malt up front, somewhat caramelly and sweet. Then loads of piney/earthy hop flavors, yet the overall flavor profile stays somewhat sweet most of the way. A funky animal urine hop flavor that I don't like. A very subtle, smooth bitterness in the finish. The 93 IBUs are well hidden.    Medium body and carbonation. No astringency, minimal warming    I liked everything about it accept for the flavor. Hop preferences are very personal, and this one didn't match my tastes. Still a good beer, but for me some hop variety swaps would improve it for my palate.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Clear reddish copper appearance with slight white head. Aroma is a hoppy sweet. Taste is a sweet hoppy very much like an IPA that is unlike and amber red ale I have had.

Overall a good beer, I was expecting more though based on the hype. At 6/$12.99, I don't think I will buy again. Maybe these cans aren't fresh enough.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Well, that's just darn yummy. This was recommended to me, and I love this brewery so I went for it ... Nugget Nectar is indeed that ... Rich, deep brown color with a hint of gold, nice head that laces down the glass. Is there a tea leaf reading equivalent to head lacing? As I've come to expect from Tröegg's, the flavor is very complex. Crisp at the start, but grows as you drink it. The hoppiness is exquisite without being agressive, the pine and resin notes are there as promised by the advertising copy on the bottle. The mango is a bit more subtle, and really comes out in the finish. I need more of this, definitely!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours a mostly clear copper amber with half of a finger of foamy off white head.  Smells of piney hops and sweet malt.  Taste follows, piney hops up front, a little tropical fruit. Sweet caramel like maltiness.  Medium bodied with a little bit of prickliness from the carbonation.  Overall an excellent red ale.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Had it in a growler from State Line. What a yummy beer! Very malty, yet hoppy. A bit strong, but that's OK. We need to find out what makes an ale "red". Besides the color.

There was a half inch of off white, foamy, fairly long-lasting head. Very good lacing.    S: A decent, but not spectacular, aroma of malt, hops, citrus, pine, and caramel.    T: Tasted of a pinch of pine resin (fleetingly so), a ton of malt (pervasively so), a fair shot of hops, a hint of caramel, light citrus notes (lemon), and some tropical fruit (mango). Kind of a one-note flavor - it seems a like a malt bomb to me - that only partially succeeds. Not terrible, but underwhelming.    F: A solid amount of carbonation with a vibrant finish. Light- to medium-bodied.    O: Like a lot of Troegs' beers I've tried, this one is overrated. It's not bad, but not great either.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 looks like a typical amber but just a little darker. smells of citrus, some mango and a little piney. this years batch didn't impress me as much as previous year but is still delicious with hints of citrus, mango and herbal qualities to it.

Medium head that dissapates quickly.     What struck me was an overwhelming malty, caramel,burnt sugar, sweetness, yet not a lot of flavor. For me, this was too sweet, and it lacked the citrusy and piney notes that are typical for an IPA.     Not a bad beer by any means, and it's worth a try as it's different and the sweetness is distinctive, but I probably won't ever get this one again.

T: Beer blends the hops and malt well. The hops seem a bit more obvious than the malt, but both areas are present and nicely blended.     M: Very easy drinker. Soft mouthfeel. The malt gives a slight spicy feel but is well done.     O: If this beer was easier to get in Oklahoma I would drink it in bunches. Malt and hops mix well to make a well balanced beer.

But here is the 2018 version:    A-ppearance - clear copper filtered color still there.  S-mell - hop is there but malt more present this time, For 2018.  F-eel: STILL PRIVATE ! Mouthfeel was not private way back in 2015, for me, but now, It’s a “Thing”.........  T-aste: Still a “Home Run” Drinkable a 7.5 and 93ish IBU’s(I LIKE that LOL!)  The 7.5 is the “Drink a few and then the alcohol hit is you” thing.  O-verall: Been purchasing it since 2015.. Got Cans this year (and cans last year too!) Always good In My Humble Opinion.  Craft beer Enthusiast’s: Enjoy.    2017 -didn’t write a review. Didn’t have to, it still a great brew! Yes I got cans on this year.    2016 got another case. great beer. Thoroughly enjoying it again this year.    Happy 2015 .. This time I bought a case. IMHO it is still great!   Isn't buying a whole case make that pretty obvious ?  I do enjoy this beer.    A - nice clear copper color. ( if it was an unfiltered copper color I would be totally ok with that also)     S - definite hop aroma.  ( i am not a -hop head- as in hop to the tenth power) so i appreciate the malt that is brought into the recipe. I poured the bottle into my Guinness glass.     T - taste IMHOpinion - home run... WOW right up there with dog fish head 90min IPA in my humble opinion. the hoppy taste is there , don't get me wrong, but I like how the malt gives it a great taste.     M - good body. not like arrogant bastard ( which is awesome also, the kind of beer that punches U in the face with flavor, - thats a good thing) this does not punch U in the face with flavor.. IT has it.. don't get me wrong but it has   good drinkability!  I can see drinking a few of these in a row no problem and then finding me under the table with my wife asking -- R U ok? and I would say something like --- ummm yeah... i'm happy.... how U doing ?...   and she would say something else that I probably won't remember...   maybe it has something to do with it being 7.5?    O - Overall - Ummmm overall... HMMMmmmm how about .. must get another 6 pack?!?!!  these guys a Troegs.. keep up the good work... dammit!!     must be the chocolate aroma floating around Hershey!    BYway - i still have 1 bottle left of the mad elf i'm holding in the fridge for myself.    ALSO of all places to find this beer.... A&P in Bergen county. go figure.   I hope the manger has another 6 pack hiding somewhere.    this concludes my review..  (also my first complete review since I joined this site)   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 I really wanted to try this beer at the brewery last year (Feb 2017)as I had never tried it before but was told that they weren't happy with the way that the batch turned out and pulled it. So, no tasting for me. I did finally pick up a 6 pack of bottles earlier this week (I don't know the best by date, though) and tried one last night. Although I have nothing to compare it to, I thought it was a well-made beer. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, it had a mild hop aroma and a 1 finger head. The taste had a mellow, but not overbearing, hop flavor with a sweetness on the back end (not a distinct mango flavor, just a sweet flavor). Overall, I thought it was good and would purchase again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bottle into a glass with sediment roused.     Overall: Excellent brew. Surprised at how good this is.    Look: orange tinged amber. Hazy. Frothy head that stayed til the last sip. Lacing everywhere.   Smell: fresh and juicy. Not as off-putting as an IPA can sometimes be. Fruity like fresh mango and pineapple.   Taste: very hoppy, yes. But not as extreme or unpleasant as I expected. A fruity hop burst that twisted to a sweet, bready, caramelized malt finish. An excellent balance of malts and pine.   Mouthfeel: substantial body. A little sticky. Smooth.   What a great hoppy amber ale.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 12 oz can into a tulip.    Pours a clear copper orange color with a finger of effervescent off-white head. The head has great retention, settling into a thin film. Leaves a minimal amount of lacing.    The aroma brings notes of caramel and bready malts, followed by a wave of piney hops and citrus.    The flavor is the perfect balance of sweet malts and bitter, piney hops. There are notes of caramel and toffee, finished off by pine and grapefruit, with a touch of orange rind.    The feel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Slightly sticky, yet incredibly smooth. Has a beautiful lingering bitterness that coats the mouth in piney hops resins.    Overall, a truly great Amber ale that definitely lives up to the hype. It's very hoppy, but it's also very balanced. I would drink this all year long if I could.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Troegs redesigned all of their packaging and I saw Nugget Nectar in cans for the first time with this release.  Gave it a try after years of not having and was really impressed. Remember it being good but this time taking one from an ice cold cooler at a pregame tailgate it was just perfect. Says 96 IBU but does not feel overly bitter hopped. I ran out to get more thinking this beer was readily available and the liquor store was down to last case. So I took it.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a deep copper amber with smaller than expected head that leaves good lace. Nose is muted compared to expectations. Malt is well present and the hops are certainly West coast style with some resin, but doesn't pop like you'd expect from a highly ranked beer. Taste is fuller, with lots of pine and resin along with the amber malts and some stone fruits. Overall, a very good beer that didn't quite meet the very high expectations.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 12 Oz can gifted by a friend - canned 3/27/17    Pours a clear deep reddish amber color with plenty of carbonation and a 3 finger fluffy head    Aroma is vaguely tropical with some cracker notes. This intensifies as the beer warms up and a very strong alcohol aroma grows with temperature as well.    Taste is sweet malt up front but fading into a more citrusy, resinous, bit of candy taste at the end - sort of like a wekly flavored lemon hard candy. Bitterness is present but does not overwhelm, inter-playing well with the malt. Once warmed up there is a strong alcohol burn but the flavor of the beer still wins over the battle.    Feel is a little sticky and heavy at first like an amber should be but it settles out to a very fresh and bright feel at the end. Very unusual and probably one of the reasons this beer rates so well.    I was pleased to finally be able to try this famous classic. It does not disappoint its reputation. A real treat.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from 12oz can in to snifter. Gorgeous amber and faint red color, with small to medium sized head. A bit of sticky lacing is present. Smell is of slightly bitter hops, a little pine, and some warm alcohol. The taste is fairly well balanced by malts considering the 93 ibus. I get more hoppy pine notes around the edges as this one finishes. Oddly enough, I did not taste much of the citrus notes that others have mentioned. Either way, this is one of my favorite offerings by Troegs, I will be getting this on an annual basis!   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a pint glass because that was all I had clean. Nice clear amber color with a slight head that dissapated fairly quickly. I immedatly got the classic hop smell with a slight pine. The taste is malty up front but then quickly follows through with citrus/ pine. For a 93 IBU it wasn't very bitter, it was crisp and refreshing and so smooth. Overall I loved it, wish I could get this in Texas every year and not just as an extra in a trade. Glad I got the opportunity to try it!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 The famously hard to get (my brother says they made more this year) specialty of PA. Decent head leaving impressive lacing. Nose is mostly hoppy with pine and medicine but there is some underlying balance.     Really impressive melange of serious hop bonafides yet extremely drinkable and balanced. Ridiculously poundable for 7.5; these just slide down with no effort. There are malts here, they just get shadowed by pine and sweet citrus everywhere they go. Smooth as heck. I see why this is so highly regarded.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Lovely golden amber with a two finger cream colored head produced by an aerated pour out of the can. Aromas are balanced between a caramel malty sweetness and a floral and resinous hop character -- reminiscent of Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA. Taste largely follows the nose: it's not hard to tell this is an amber ale given the sweet caramel malt flavors, but it is backed up by a flavorful bouquet of fruity and floral hops that pushes this brew close to DIPA territory. Not much earthy, herbal, or resinous hops that I can taste, despite what is said on the packaging. Great mouthfeel, balance of flavors, and semi-dry finish. Well worth (at least) one sixer when available!    86/100

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Freshest by 05 19 17 printed on the label.  12 oz. Bottle poured into a tumbler style pint glass.    Poured a nice clear amber with two fingers of cream colored, thick and and foamy, lasting head. Moderate aroma of piney hops, bready malts and some hints of citrus. Hoppy and bitter all the way through but nicely balanced with malts and a touch of caramel sweetness. Finishes crisp with a little heat. The body is on the low side of medium with good, but not too high, carbonation.    The bitterness and ABV are well above the style guidelines but that won't stop me from drinking it. I'm not a judge anyway. This is a good one, definitely one you have to try.

Good balance between malt and hops, but the malt dominates.  Taste: Caramel, toffee, lemon, and orange with some pleasant bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Fairly complex for an amber.   Overall: A classic amber. Well balanced and more hoppy than any amber I've had.

L: This beer has a great deep amber glow. The moderate head dissipates to a death grip white lace head that stick to the glass.   S: Sweet caramel/bready malts with suuuuweeet ripe ruby red grapefruit. The ever present Alcohol esters tickle your nose as its sweet core hides the hop bitterness that lies just beneath the surface.  T: Awesome, in your face over ripe red grapefruit bitter hop bomb wrapped in a beautiful surgery caramel whose bitter pine cone resin tackles the taste buds once the beer has passed your gullet.   M: Perfect for this style. Full, chewy, perfectly carbonated.   O: This is my must buy every year when the Old Man Winter shits all over my BBQ by the pool fantasies. If you need a close cousin to this as a year round option I would point you to Stone's Double Bastard.    Buy this beer you cunt.. Don't think twice.. just do it.. and then write a review and make your friends buy it, and then tweet about it ,so we can have a ground swell that this becomes a year round option, and not only a Winter release.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 This was once a stellar beer. Since the brewery moved from Harrisburg to Hershey the bottom has dropped out. It was once a beer I waited the entire year for and would horde as much as I could. Now, I buy a six and hope it has changed. The fresh citrus/hop punch that made it so unique has been replaced by blandness with very little mouthfeel. This year, like the past couple, I will be limiting my consumption to one six. However, I still look forward to Nimble Giant - which has stepped up to replace NN has my favorite beer from Troegs. June cannot come soon enough.

Aroma is very muted with a bit of sweet malt and some pine hiding in the background. Taste is a bit of a letdown in that it is quite average; moderately sweet caramel malts with some pine. Moderately bitter in the finish. Medium in body, a bit of hop slickness, a touch of almost syrup like sweetness, and moderate carbonation. Overall I was a bit let down here. I have very fond memories of this beer from years ago but it just doesn't do it for me right now.

Strong hoppiness, but not overpowering. Some fruitiness as well.  T - Did not taste as hoppy as it smelled, but very refreshing. A complexity in pine, flowery, and fruity flavors that probably come from the different styles of hops used.  F - More body than an IPA, but still refreshing. The alcohol is well masked. Carbonation is perfect.  O - This was good beer. Not my favorite style for this time of the year, but it really is great for hop-lovers.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 L: This beer pours a very clear, deep amber color. A moderate head dissipates to a spotty head with mostly tight bubbles that stays. Thick, sticky foam trails keep adding up as it is consumed and they persist.  S: Mostly sweet, bready malt with some citrus and some pine. The aroma wasn't in-your-face strong, however.  T: Slight underlying bread and biscuit. Bitter citrus peel initially with apricot, citrus and some pine. Some alcohol taste.  M: Extremely smooth and perfectly carbonated.

Creamy, good mouthfeel, with just a little lingering afterwards. Tasty and easy drinking beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 poured from 12oz can from this year's release  awesome amber color - deep red  smell i would say is mostly malt upfront with piney notes  taste is fantastic - crisp and soft, big blast of hops, really strong malt backbone and big bitterness at the end. a great, classic beer that packs a wallop but stays refreshing, balanced and nuanced. excellent   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Best By date says 4/17/17. No idea when it was canned. I'm really getting to dislike this Best By stuff. Put the damn bottling/canning date on your beers without all the other mysterious coding. Has a number 301, so could it be canned on the 301st day of 2016? Nose is hops, pine, malts, caramel, grapefruit pith. Pours a beautiful ruby gold with an off white head. Good carbonation. Taste is hoppy, piney, fruity. Some dank bitterness on the finish. This years offering was not as good as previous years. Didn't exhibit that juicy hop quality. At $14.99 a six pack, one is enough for me.

S: Malty and rich... mixed with juicy citrusy hops. Floral as well.    T/F: Rich caramel malts... full bodied and juicy. Not bitter, but a delicious juicy/floral hop profile. Grapefruit and pineapple... hibiscus. Resinous and sticky on the tongue. Finish is caramel and juice. A little warming... hides the ABV super well.    O: A delicious Red ale/IPA hybrid that is a yearly event here in Pennsylvania. Always a favorite, and one to stock up on for some every day fantastic while supplies last.

Hopped up for sure, this is the best take on an amber I've had. Wait, this is a 7.5 percenter, I can't tell. Wait, this ain't available all year for some reason... hurry up and GET THIS BEER !

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Pours a clear reddish brown color with a tight, off-white head that little bits of lacing.    Smells of citrus and herbal hops.    Tastes of the hops upfront layered over a great malt base. Hops lead off with notes of grapefruit and some pine. This gives way to caramel malts with notes of toffee and toasted bread. More hops come next as herbal and earthy notes appear. Finishes with some lingering hops.    Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation.    Overall, this is a great, hoppy red.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Nice IPA. Got a 6 pack. Nice color, not much lacing. Great taste, easy to drink. The beer is not super bitter. This IPA would work well with food. Troegs has a winner with Nugget Nectar.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured a clear deep amber color with a fingers worth of foamy white head. The nose has some citrus notes with pine and some caramel. The flavor is well balanced. A perfect combination of the amber ale and IPA characteristics. The feel is medium with good carbonation. I've been waiting a long time to try this one and it may not be as big as some of the beers out there not but it gets everything it does right!

look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Appearance- One of the most beautiful looking copper pours that I have ever seen.    Smell- Floral hops, some resin, and burnt sugar sweetness.    Tatse- Damn near perfect balance of classic hop flavor with that malty brown sugar sweetness, much stronger in the flavor punch than the aroma lets on.    Feel- What you would expect for the style, more medium bodied with medium carbonation.    Overall- An excellent beer from Troegs, and definitely stands up there with some of the best in the style. If you like your IPAs a little more balanced than complete palate wreckers, this is for you.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Not intense at all. Actually leans towards a brown ale to me at first squeeze. Finishes without any desire to make a point. Bold yeungling, loblolly, goes perfectly with herb roasted chicken. Keep it light but not poolside light. Can't get a 7.5 like this anywhere.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pours an amber color with a one finger foam head. Smells citrusy, grapefruit, and floral hops. Taste caught me off guard, I was expecting from the smell a citrusy hoppy beer. Instead it tastes very good with a nice hop presence and a little bit of a sweet finish. Very well balanced beer with a low lingering bitterness. I would definitely buy again!

A deep clear orange with a beautiful thick beige head and excellent lacing. Very pleasant smell, malty, sweet, and floral. The taste is very nice with caramel, orange, and a nice earthiness. A very enjoyable beer!   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This is a nice enough beer but I honestly do not understand the hype. I got a fresh one from a can. It pours a reddish amber with roughly an inch of head. The nose is surprisingly devoid of too much hop aroma. The taste is similarly not as hoppy as one is made to expect and most of the bitterness arrives late. Overall, it's not as complex or unique as others describe it.   
look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Being that this is my favorite beer in the world, I was honestly a little disappointed this year. One of the best things about nugget nectar is the simplicity of its hop profile. Citrus introduction with a piney resinoid mid to a metallic finish has always been how I've known the beer...the epitome of an imperial red ale. It reminded me of a Six Point Sweet Action with a thicker mouthfeel and a bit of chew. Now I'm seeing imperial amber everywhere on the labels and what used to just be warrior and nugget hops has turned into warrior, nugget, tomahawk, simcoe and palisade hops. It muddies the transition of a cult classic and I wish Troegs didn't mess with a good thing. Regardless, it's still delicious, but it blends in with a lot of other IPA's now...

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Pours an interesting light amber, with orange highlights. Has a massive off white head, but has little lacing. Head sticks around for a long time. The smell is sweet citrus, grapefruit and orange, along with bitter floral and grassy qualities.   Bitter and floral in the mouth, with large flavors of pine. The finish starts off with a ting of sweet caramel, then shows a massive swell of pine, hints of resin, and again, floral. The whole experience is very bitter, with only a brief hint of sweetness to try to balance it all out. The beer is incredibly light, easy in carbonation, and very drinkable. It's dry, as the bitter profile would suggest, but isn't overly so. Overall a great beer, and a nice break from the IPAs while still offering many of the same qualities they'd give you.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 As someone who usually drinks IPAs, American ales tend to lean too malty for my personal tastes, but this has a nice balance of hops at basically every turn. The finish is particularly well-balanced, providing a little gush of hops at the end that leaves you ready for more very quickly. It's very drinkable, especially for a beer at 7.5 ABV. If you are a fan of ales, I recommend you try it at least once if it's available. Poured on tap at Flanagan's Pub in Dayton, OH.

On the negative side, I found the head shortlived, and thinnish, but I have yet to find the perfect beer, though many come very close.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Here's a red ale with a lot of hops in it. One of the earliest examples of a hoppy beer on the East Coast, before they fell in love with orange juice beer hype.     Lots of carbonation, full 1" off white head on a red/amber ale appearance. Aroma had all that red malt and plenty of the bitter nugget hop. Is this only nugget hops? They aren't the most aromatic hop to use.    Its plenty malty, plenty bitter. Its a bigger beer than i thought at the outset. The citrus is grapefruit, there is some woodiness but not pine like. Lots of caramel. The nugget hops seem to provide more in the way of bitterness moreso than a discernable flavor.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Tröegs Nugget Nectar brewed by Tröegs Brewing Company, with an ABV of 7.50% This brew pours out a deep burnt amber color with a nice white head. This brew has a real nice look to it. The smell of Tröegs Nugget Nectar, is rich with hop bitterness grains and malts. The hops are kinda inviting to the smell of this brew. This brew has a bolder smell to it than most American Amber/Red Ales on the market. Not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is bold and rich with flavors. You first pick up on the hops citrus bitterness in this brew. Then there is a nice citrus sweetness, and grains and malts. There is a lot going on in Tröegs Nugget Nectar. This brew has a real nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. I can't get over how smooth this brew is. It is real hard to pick up on the 7.50% ABV in this brew. Not saying that is a bad thing. The mouthfeel of Tröegs Nugget Nectar , is bold rich, clean smooth and bitter. Overall I'm giving Tröegs Nugget Nectar a 4.50 out of 5. I would buy this brew again. Tröegs Brewing Company, did a real nice job with this one.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Tröegs Nugget Nectar | Tröegs Brewing Company. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this beer's head is three fingers thick, with secular lacing, and a clear reddish amber body.    Smells like a not-to-the-point-of-astringency blend of hops resembling tangerine, melons dare I say, and a piney "zing" at the end of the whiff.    I taste a clean, mild malt foundation with the hops I was talking about in the smell as more of an accentuation instead the main attraction. Which is not to say that their flavor in underwhelming. It just doesn't give you that slap across the mouth. The mango mentioned on the labeling adds a nice overall refreshing element to the flavor profile.    The mouthfeel I'm picking up is medium-light with fair carbonation.    Overall, I'll give Tröegs Nugget Nectar | Tröegs Brewing Company a 4.5. A very easy-going imperial ale that isn't an IPA. Who'da thunk'd it?

Full White head, most of it fades quickly, but some lacing sticks around.  TASTE: Orange, Pine. Very Tasty. Love the fresh hops. Gives a juiciness that fights the "dank".   FEEL: Good carbonation.

Mouthfeel is almost perfect. Chewy, but a great balance with carbonation, and a dry finish which comes at you at the end of the back end. Top three amber reds I've had, I've had many, and most were mediocre. This is NOT a mediocre Red.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 DATE: April 17, 2016... OCCASION: celebrating the first day of grilling and the Cavs' first playoff win--fifteen more to go... GLASSWARE: Barley Creek pint... APPEARANCE: crystal clear dark copper amber body sits squarely below a thick, creamy white head with sincere staying power... nice stratified lacing, paralleling as a sunset might... AROMA: the nugget releases strong floral, resinous aura while the tomahawk releases a bitter, orange peel/pineapple... PALATE: at 7.5ish% ABV, more than palatable--one could see why Troegs tried to call this an Imperial amber, as the back end suggests a maltiness that clips its bitterness and enables swift sipping... medium-bodied and "easy," with a slight pill at the teeth and a mellow movement to the throat... TASTE: an earthiness grounds a complex profile, with orange, pineapple, mango and soft fruits eliciting the lion's share of attention... malts are sweet bread and caramel... a combination that is mellow, reasonably weighted, and balanced... OVERALL: a lot to like about this one... after having heard so much about it, I had no fear of being let down, but rather a feeling of hop-head conflation... into the second bottle, an aromatic, resinous experience--can stand up to or next to the many illustrious IPAs out there... another win from Troegs....

Second scent I get is citrus and when I dive deeper I start smelling some tropical fruit. Very slight malt backbone.  Taste - Very well balanced! Floral, Citrus, tropical hop taste but with a good malt backbone. Not overly bitter or sweet.  Feel - medium body and carbonation and easy to drink  Overall - Incredible Imperial Amber. Hoppy and well balanced!

If this is the level of beer that their other brews are I wanna try them all. I love color of this beer. I nice orange /dark orange color, its a nice shade of orange from all the hops/ malt combo. The balance taste of this beer is also amazing on its own. Theres a bunch of hops in the beer , but you only get the taste not the end note of a sip. I wanna give this beer 5 overall but i feel that this beer lacks a strong smell.( not that there isn't a smell but i only smell the malt/grains ) I would have the beer again 100%

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Another I've neglected to review: 12 ounce bottle poured into Belgian ale glass.    L: Amber with a hint of reddish copper, like a classic red-brown Lincoln cent. 3F+ foamy head with good retention, lacing, and a cap.    S: Floral perfume up front, with citrus and tropical notes. Pine and light biscuit malt.    T: Hard to live up to the nose, but it comes close. Tropical and citrus fruits dominate up front, some piney goodness and light malt on finish. Very little bitterness and very little overt sweetness.    F: Good balance between the sweet and bitter. Light to medium body, light to medium carbonation, good drying on tongue. Not really sessionable.    O: Manages decent ABV and high IBU very well, good taste. I'm not as absolutely gung ho on this as some, but it's very solid.

It doesn't have the best hop profile in the world, but all the various parts come together as one of the most enjoyable, easy drinking beers I've had. The sweetness really worksworks for me, and ensures there's little or no bitterness to be had. Had this a bunch in North Carolina, and I'm pretty sad it couldn't follow me up north.

Tastes like candied orange, mango, pineapple, papaya, pithy bitter peach, some caramel, toast, mild spice, fresh pine and dank earthy grass. Feels medium bodied, creamy with low carbonation. Overall a really well crafted imperial amber ale.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a bottle into a tulip. 2016 vintage.     Pours a deep amber, with a nice filtered body. Dirty, white half inch head lays on top of the beer and slowly disseminates. Thick lacing lines the sides of the glass. Freshly sliced sweet pineapple, pine trees, and tropical aromas fill the nose. Grapefruit & mango are blended with a great hop bitterness that is balanced with sweet malt as it goes down the throat. Easy drinking, crisp, and well carbonated. Nugget Nectar is elite when it comes to hopped up amber ales. One of my favorites in the spring months.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This imperial amber ale has 7.5% ABV and 95 IBUs.    Look-It pours a brilliant orange-blossom honey color with prominent copper hues. The head is frothy and khaki-colored.    Smell-It smells strongly of pine and citrus like orange, grapefruit, tangerine, mango, and papaya. The malt base comes through among the strong hop base.    Taste-It has a the pine resins come through first and then the sweetness from the malts which were a tad strong for me and then it finishes with some citrus and tropical fruits. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and rich and creamy. It isn’t too sweet that it ruins the beer, but I prefer a more mild sweetness.    Overall-It is a great beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass:    Appearance: pours a copper-orange in color, with a completely translucent body. Nice, thick head on top, which leaves plenty of lacing while drinking.    Aroma: lots of pine, mixed in with some solid fruity notes as well. Pretty potent mango sweetness, with some bitter pineapple skin. Lots of pine.    Taste: the only issue I had here was that it finishes sooo sweet. The initial flavor is bitter piney-ness, followed up by some really nice mango. Some beers blast you with an array of fruitiness, but this one is totally focused on the mango. Finishes with some more bitterness, but also a ton of sweetness, which isn't my favorite flavor.    Feel: medium-bodied and pretty sticky on the finish. Crisp carbonation.    Overall: a very good brew. I didn't even know it was a "Red ale" until jotting down this review, although it really was more IPA than red anyway. In any case, I'd drink it again any day.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Comes in a crystal clear copper color with effervescent carbonation and a pillowy, off white head. The nose offers fresh squeezed tangerine juice, grapefruit pith, perhaps a touch of papaya, sweet bready malts, caramel, and sticky pine.  Big grapefruit, tangerine, and lemon notes hit you upfront. Juicy in texture and lively. The mid-palate starts to shift to the malts, which turns into a big toasted brown bread and caramel sweetness near the finish, but just before it gets cloying, the hop resin kicks in, leaving mouth-smacking lingering flavors of orange peel and pine sap.    The mouthfeel is medium-plus, medium-carbonated, with an oily, slick feel that approaches creaminess at times. Very drinkable.    While I wouldn't consider this a whale anymore, this still remains a rock solid beer and one of the best commonly available hop-forward red ales. Worth seeking out at least once a year.

S: Citrus. Sweet. Some Pine. Light hops. Sweet juices. Mostly on the sweet malty side of the aroma scale.     T/M: Bitter hops. Dry yet still pretty smooth. Pine. Sweet fruits. Mango. Malts seem to dominate the beer. Hop flavors are nice but subdued. The balance could be better. has a nice piney aftertaste. Alcohol is hidden well.     O: This is an excellent beer. Yet, it is definitely slightly overrated. I find that it is also not as good as previous years. The hop and malt flavors work well together. Not a beer for the hop bomb people, as it is subdued in that department. I would still recommend this beer, especially when had fresh.    Cheers!!!

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A: [4.50] Deep red color approaching a light cola color. Forms 1 finger of dense white head. The beer is really transparent and looks inviting in a glass. The bottle lists the ABV (7.5%) and the created date (01/04/16).    S: [3.50] Mild pine, peaches, malted scent, hints of caramel.    T: [4.50] Lemon rind, peppery pine, pineapple, not much in the way of malty sweetness. Finishes with a nice bitter tinge.    M: [4.25] Nice medium+ coating mouthfeel. Really good carbonation level. Finally has a good hop bitter finish that is good but doesn't linger past its welcome.     O: [4.25] The nose on this one is a little subdued and doesn't hint at how great this beer tastes. The beer is really nice with some solid hop notes throughout the beer. The beer also has a really solid mouthfeel that makes it feel hearty and adds to the overall enjoyment. This is a great beer.

A ton of resin/piney hop love here, but doesn't leave that "just smoked a cigar" mouth residue that you can sometimes find with high IBU brews. Somehow manages to be balanced even with the hops assault. Nicely done.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 L: Pours a very clear dark red-amber, kind of a burnt orange, with a white head and very good head retention.    S: Nice balance of grapefruit and pine, with some bready malt behind it all and a mild metallic hope note. Powerful, resinous, fresh, classic.    T: Resinous American hop varieties, toasty bready malt and bitter grapefruit rind. Clean flavor profile and a semidry, citrusy bitter finish. This is kind of one of those beers where there’s not ton you can remark on with the flavor profile, it’s simply great.     F: Medium body with pretty abundant carbonation that lends to the drinkability. A slick resinous mouthfeel and a touch of warmth between sips.     Thoughts: Glad I finally got to review an old personal favorite. Such a great beer to look forward to each year, and you don’t have to kill a man to get your hands on it. Highly recommended for those who have not tried NN.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 2016 Version - pours an amber orange color that is very clear. A large slightly off white head. There is some frothy lacing with some carbonation. The odor for me is sweet, malty, grapefruit, tropical fruits, mandarin, pineapple, apricot, floral, slightly sugary. The taste for me is refreshing, yet malty, grapefruit, bread like, grassy, floral, candy like, mandarin, slightly melon and slightly floral. Barely any bitterness.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Poured from 12 ounce bottle (fridge temp approx. 38 degrees) to goblet-style stemmed glass. Bottle legend says best by 5/14/16, unsure of bottled on date.    Look: Pours a copper/orange color with a thick, creamy, slightly off-white 3/4 inch head that dissipated fairly quickly but left behind a nice lasting lace with moderate carbonation.    Smell: Pine and resins dominate with fruity citrus in the background. Nice overall hoppy aroma hints at what is to come.    Taste: Hoppy pine flavor hits hard and fast, fading to citrus and a faint metallic (but not unpleasant) aftertaste. Caramel malt flavor comes along for the ride and helps balance the bitterness. Favors intensified as the glass warmed.    Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied and crisp from first sip to last. Almost a creaminess I attribute to the continual carbonation and lacing that lasts to the end.    Overall: It is almost like a red/amber ale trying to pass itself off as an APA, but in a very good way. This is my first opportunity to try Nugget Nectar and I was drawn to the hype as well as the Troegs brand. I've always liked red ales, my first love in craft beers, but now my go-to beer is an IPA. This brew satisfies both ends of that particular spectrum. Very drinkable despite the 7.5 ABV, I could see myself putting away a sixer over the course of an evening but would be equally satisfied having one or two before dinner. I gotta shop the other distributors in the area to see if they have any left and stock up.

Two fingers of head and a bit of aeration. The head takes a minute or two to dissipate.    Aroma: Orange, fruits, grapefruit, some mango.    Taste: Hops, pine, fruit, orange with a pleasant hoppy bitterness.    Mouthfeel: A pleasant hoppy bitterness.    Overall: An excellent beer which should be regularly consumed. Not sure why the company creates so much hype surrounding the annual release of this beer. It's an excellent beer, but cut the hype please. Thanks.

Pours a beautiful amber color with a white frothy, slightly creamy head.    Aroma: pine/citrus/ and perhaps even fruity hop aroma. I pick up a decent malt sweetness as well.  Taste: interesting and hard to tell whats going on. theres bitterness, sweetness, bite, pine, resinous, astringent type of thing going on all at once.

(T) Awesome taste of bread, pine, caramel, and grapefruit, and not a hint of alcohol.     (F) It is crisp and easy drinking despite the IBU. I think it is top notch.

Pours a crystal clear amber body with a 2 finger white head - this is exactly what an amber should look like. Perfect color, extreme clarity, nice head and nice lacing. Ring of retention.    Aromas are piney, resinous, dank, rind, caramel, rye, biscuits. Taste is light bitterness, lots of pine and resinous hop oils, citrus rind, followed by a light bitterness on the tongue. Extremely drinkable mouthfeel, body is medium and alcohol is well hidden. Medium carbonation. Pleasantly soft for 7.5%.    Nugget Nectar never disappoints, where it shines is how easy to drink and flavorful it is. Benchmark for the style.

Chrystal clear orange amber and a creamy off-white head that clings to the glass as if its life depended on it is striking. Smell and taste while a hop head's dream is unbalanced and heavy-handed. Lacks the complexity that can be achieved with imperial reds. Feel is fine but a bit thick. Overall a good beer but not in this style.

Good retention and spiderweb lacing.    Aroma: It has a nice grapefruit and orange zest smell with a bit of this deep earthy character.    Taste: The beer opens with a bit of a spicy taste much like you would get from a gingerbread cookie but not quite ginger. It follows with a bit of sweetness with quite a bit of alcohol flavor. A touch of pith and this yeasty bready aftertaste. If I had to describe this beer in two words it would be bready and alcoholic.    Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a good amount of bitterness without being overwhelming. Good carbonation and a bit wet on the palate.    Overall: It's a good beer. It didn't really stand out to me but it is enjoyable. I might pick it up again if I see it but I'm not going to go out of the way for it.

Not as much citrus in the flavor as I anticipated based on the smell. The pine is prominent with hints of lime and orange peel however I did not enjoy the aftertaste similar to how others have noted.

Smell: Grapefruit and hops are very forward on the nose!    Taste: Juicy, dank, hoppy, grapefruity, piney, and a nice malty/caramel backbone! Tastes amazing!    Feel: Medium bodied, very crisp and refreshing.    Overall: This is one of my favorite all time beers. I am not a fan of amber ales but this thing is amazing. Super hopped up and its an imperial amber to boot. I always grab 1-2 cases of this every year when it comes out as it flies off the shelves as soon as it hits them. Get out there and grab this if its still around!!

Liked it overall but not up to the world class rating especially at $15/6pck. Perpetual is better.

The amber pour is gorgeous and the malt backbone adds some additional strength to support the powerful hoppiness. The initial bitterness gives way to a more complex hop profile. By the end of the beer I'm wanting a second.

This is a beer that I feel gets a lot of hype - I get that it's a really nice hoppy red but I am not sure I get the love for this.    Its color is ruby red, fizzy off white head with decent retention.     Nose is a bit floral with a nice spicy malt bill.    Flavor is great, juicy and floral hops with a nice bitter a great sweetness to balance.    Feel is a bit brash, but it's fine.    Overall, a nice brew, but not sure I get the 96 rating or the cases disappearing in minutes.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 My first time trying what apparently is a highly revered beer and I'm not into it. Looks okay...clear amber with a fluffy white head that lingers and leaves heavy lacing. Smell is unpleasant. Medicinal with some faint pine and citrus flavors. Taste is also unpleasant. Again, medicinal is the best way of describing it. The first couple sips were like biting into an aspirin, super bitter and metallic in taste (poured from a bottle, btw). About 1/4 through the glass (maybe after my taste buds adjusted) I finally started getting some piney, resinous hop flavor under all that sheer bitterness. It wasn't until about halfway through my glass (maybe after my taste buds were completely annihilated) that I finally started to get some faint hints of caramely malty sweetness. Feel is medium, somewhat creamy, and very dry on the finish. Amber ales are generally one of my favorite styles, but besides the color, I don't really see how this fits the style at all. I found it very unbalanced, very bitter, and lacking in a lot of the toasted biscuit flavors I like so much in this style. Some of the flavors were just bizarre and I'm not even sure if they were intentional. Not worth the hype, imo.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from bottle into a teku.  Red-Gold color, crystal clear. Billowy white head initially but recedes to a thin ring after a few sips.  Aroma seems somewhat subdued. notes of citrus and pine.  The taste is predominately resinous, piney hops, some citrus like bitter grapefruit peels. All the hop flavors are gently supported by a backbone of caramel-like malt sweetness.  Medium body.  Overall, a very enjoyable red ale. If it were available in Minnesota, it would have a place in my fridge.

Tastes somewhat bitter with hoppy, resinous flavor. It's definitely a malt forward beer however. Overall, it's worth trying but I feel like this year's release is underwhelming compared to the past years. 2014 was good, 2015 was average. This year is below average.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 6 packs of 12 oz cans. Pours golden Amber, good bite from the carbonation.    Smell- Astrigent. Medicinal. Would not describe as pleasant.     Taste- There is a metallic taste in all of the examples I've had this year. Not sure if it has anything to do with the fact that I got them in cans or is inherent to the actual beer. There is a bit of hoppiness, but I struggle to describe the other flavors. Medicinal still comes to mind. I'm not sure what they're really going for taste-wise.     I bought this newly released, only a couple weeks old at most. People said last year's release wasn't the best, so I was hoping for this to impress me. Wow, was I completely suckered into this by the marketing and hype surrounding the release (store I bought it from had a full end aisle display). I'd say this was even worse than I had last year, and I'm still not sure of the taste they are going for.     The fact that this beer has a 96 on this site is an embarrassment and speaks more to marketing/hype surrounding the yearly release than any actual merit in the current craft beer market.

Since so little was brewed, and there was such a high demand, the brew gained a cult status.    Imagine my disappointment with this years drastically watered down version of what was previously a world class brew. That is certainly no longer the case. All of the previous in your face character is gone. Mouthfeel is non-existent. Malt profile is average at best. Hopping is weak to be generous. NN has now become a total sellout to corporate profits!! Even the carton and labels have been drastically changed and cheapened in order to squeeze out a few more pennies of profit per case.    Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS BEER!! What was once a classic is now not even average.

I finally made it to a store I'd been wanting to visit for a long time, specifically because they had 6-packs of Alpine's Pure Hoppiness. Well, I got to try it, because they had a keg tapped for growler purchases. Very tasty. Alas, no 6-packs (at $17.99) left. But they also had Nugget Nectar tapped, and WOW! By far the best thing I've ever tried from Troegs. Actually liked it more than the Alpine offering. Hops and more hops, and bitter (93 IBUs!) -- just the way I like it. Yet at "only" 7.5% it's like a session beer (at least for me). Overall, a home run. Wait, I'm writing this on Super Bowl weekend, so make it a touchdown. Totally deserving of its "world-class" rating.   
look: 3 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.75 Orange copper with a moderate fluffy head and some sticky lacing.    I get a little Spree candy aromas at first, then some tangerine.    This is the second time I've had this in two weeks. The first time I would have said it's a little downhill from here, but these two cans were drastically different from each other, as such I'll increase my score a good amount but I think there are some consistency issues, although it's possible this is one of the few IPAs I've ever had that is bit better a couple weeks after canning as opposed to super fresh.    Moderately to extremely bitter depending on your tolerance level. A little wet rug, cat pee, resin, and some tropical notes.    Retrying the 2018 release fresh, and it tastes and smells like PEZ all the way to me. Odd turn of events.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This is a crystal-clear, sparkling medium-amber beer wearing a large, pebbly head the color of ancient ivory. Head retention is modest, and lacing is good, consisting of irregular slabs and caverns. The nose is medium-big: an appetizing, seamless blend of candied grapefruit, floral notes and subtle pine, with slight alcohol overtones riding above it. The palate leads with bitter citrus and pine, with a slight IPA soapiness; midpalate the spicy, candy-like florals emerge, as does a nice weedy character, and the soapiness retreats. The bitterness builds to a point a bit north of middling for an IPA, allowing some of the bready malt foundation to show. The finish is pretty clean, showing just a bit of bittersweet nuttiness; the linger is a moderate grass/pine bitterness that sticks around for a few minutes. Retrogustative olfaction is weedy/grassy. Mouthfeel is biggish for the light-medium body and the texture is very nice, exhibiting near-optimal levels of creaminess and pepperiness for the style. Very easy-drinking, tasty red IPA. (growler)

Smell: Juicy, piney, fresh hops dominate with hints of citrus and fresh cut grass lurking in the background.    Taste: Hoppy with a very strong malt backbone. The hop bitterness is present up front, but fades to a tough, malty, bready finish. Excellently balanced. I can't tell if its an IPA or an Amber ale, but I believe Troegs has welded the two together fairly solidly here.    Feel:     Overall:

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Canned on 1/20/16, sampled on 2/5/16 from 8 oz sniffer. Aroma: hop aroma dominates nose with moderate amounts of tropical fruit, mango, pineapple, and dank hop resin. Light hints of alcohol in nose. Light amounts of malt sweetness with faint hint of caramel. Esters, if present, are likely overpowered by hop aroma. Appearance: clear. Medium Amber color, with orange hue. Medium-low head retention with light tan head quickly disappearing (about 2 minutes) into skim with fine bubbles around rim. Light amounts of medium sized lacing. Flavor: malt flavor low, with some hints of bread crust and slight hint of sweet toffee/caramel - but does not detract from hop flavor. Balance is hop forward with moderate hop bitterness and heavy hop flavor of tropical fruit, grapes and tangerine. Dry finish. Aftertaste clean with whispers of sweet malt and hop flavors just barely remaining. Mouthfeel: medium body. Medium carbonation. Very slight alcohol warmth. No creaminess or astringency. Overall: very enjoyable hop forward Amber/ IPA. Glad the finish is dry and Carmel malts are subdued, thus reducing sweetness. Hop flavors, while at higher levels are nuanced and enjoyable. Would like to smell more hop aroma. Perhaps even this would be more enjoyable at lower alcohol levels so aroma and taste could be even more refined and shine through. 42/50.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 Great, glowing ruddy orange color, with a nice foamy head. Medium bore tropical fruits on the nose, with just a suggestion of weed. Flavor is wan citrus and warm pine, with just a bit too much muddy, charred bitterness in the way to sort it out. Good juice, but less than I was expecting. Lovely body - substantial enough to keep you from housing it, but light enough for ready drinking.    This is a very nice beer, but it feels...old? Like it might have been revolutionary, a number of years ago, or perhaps the case I got saw a harder road to my door than I know. I'm happy I have more of it, but I don't know if I'd undertake the hustle to get it, again. Would be far more impressive as a regular offering, than a semi-mythical once a year.

O: This has been one of my top 2 favorite Troegs beers, since I first had one of their beers about 10 years ago. They never disappoint. I just don't think the 2016 version is as good as the 2015 version or the 2014 version. I've been drinking the Nuggets for about 6-7 years now (sneaking their main batch beers when I was younger ~10 years ago) and I just feel like the Nugget Nectar was best in 2014 so far from my trials. Taste is subjective, so I don't feel like anyone has to agree with this.    Cheers everyone!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This beer pours a crystal clear orange amber with a huge, fluffy off white head. Retention is excellent and there are many thick sheets of hanging lacing. Smell is tropical and citrus fruits, dank and pine. Taste is the same with a touch of bready malt and a good amount of bitterness. Feel is medium, slick and resinous. Overall a great beer. I buy a case every year.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 a: beautiful mixture of amber, mahogany, and some ruby red. pours a 2 finger off-white frothy head that is seeming to linger    s: super juicy. pineapple, strawberry, apricot, grapefruit. there is a sweet caramel malt backbone, with a dry crackery aroma towards the back as well. this one makes the mouth water    t: a burst pineapple immediately followed by bitter grapefruit. right behind that, in rapid fire, is a nice caramel sweetness to mellow out the bitterness. following that, perhaps a bit muted, is a light mango & strawberry sweetness. there is that dry, crackery presence in the mouth here as well. finishes with little piney bitterness    m: mouthfeel is the lighter side of medium. carbonation level feels perfect for the style - not too much, but enough to make the juicy hops stand out    o: its amazing how quickly all the flavors transition in this beer, i don't think i've ever had one that moves that fast. it really made me focus and think on the flavors (not in a bad way). the sweet fades to bitter, then back to sweet, then finishes bitter. its an incredibly smooth, and crisp beer. definitely on the bitter side, but does have a solid malt presence. worth a pickup, for sure

Das Review:    L - Bright and rich amber color; crystal clear hue. Nice and carbonated with a two finger head. Layer of foam on top; loose lacing on the side. Alcohol gripping to the glass pretty well.    S - Difficult from a tumbler, Syrupy caramel malts with citrus notes coming through. Notes: maple, caramel, grapefruit, pine. Interesting aroma.     T - Hop dominated. Very distinctive Nugget hop character that encompasses the whole experience. No amber or red character to it. Citrus tasting and quite bitter.     F - Light viscosity; Clean and crisp with medium strong alcohol burn. Strong nugget hop after taste that coats the tongue. Pretty rough stuff.     O - Fresh nugget hops are pretty bomb if you ask me. I love IPAs and even though this is a Red Ale, this certainly feels like a pine IPA. Nugget hops I feel give the best of both worlds between the tropical juiciness and the pine bitterness, and Nugget Nectar is a good example of that. Only comes around late January, so I am going to try and get this while I can. Cheers!

Great fruity tropical smell right off the bat then yields to an interesting clover honey like smell. Taste is very similar to the smell, juicy and honey like. Call me crazy but its like a beer version of mead in a way. What the heck do I know, anyone really going to read my reviews? Probably not but my wife likes it so much that I will probably get a fresh squeeze a little later ;)

Unfortunately this just does not live up to the hype. I have no idea why this one gets so much praise. Like Hopslam, this one probably stood out 5 years ago. Today, it just doesn't cut it.

S - Pine, spice, and a familiar sweetness, like orange blossom honey. Some citrus, like orange peel. Inviting.    T - Taste follows the nose. Pine and spice, but with a citrus blast and a big juicy mango. Pine and honey in the aftertaste. Is this good or what?    F - Medium bodied, resinous yet smooth. A dryness that encourages the next sip, yet the flavors linger nicely. My whole mouth is happy.     O - In my amature opinion, there are a lot of good things going on with this beer. Tastes like the first day of spring. Cheers!

This was the first beer that totally blew my mind when I was introduced about 5 years ago. A tropical explosion awaits to those who suffer through winter in anticipation. The malt backbone is a bit more pronounced than in years past but it doesn't detract.    On a side note, I wish my mom would have told me that Troegs hired her to be their new graphic artist.

Great juicy hop flavor with the semi-sweet amber profile I believe works best when drinking fresh. Mouthfeel is similar to an amber with the nice hoppy bite of an imperial ipa. Very drinkable, excited to have this back in my fridge. I'll have no problem polishing off a case with my buddies this upcoming bachelor party weekend.

The first case I got of this was a first order 3 hours from the brewer. A rich blast of flavors progress into a hoppy finish that dissipates into a subtle aftertaste that leaves you craving that next swig.     Drinking this bottle now, almost a year after it's shipping., tastes like a ranky amber ale.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 After years of tasting and appreciating various West Coast IPAs, I've grown to appreciate beers with an eye towards hops, but with attention and variation in their malt characters. Whereas the traditional West Coast IPAs seem as an expression of hops over a blank malt, Red IPAs or Amber IPAs such as Nugget Nectar offer some complexity and contrast between the body and aroma of the beer.     Tröegs Nugget Nectar, I believe, does this very well.   The nose hints at mostly sweet honey amber malt, but it is sweet, malty and bitter (slightly floral) in taste.     As with Hopback Amber, it is a delicious beer with desire for a quick follow-up.     Only thing wanting somehow in this beer is a slightly more aggressive carbonation. It tends to feel mild on this level. If it had a little bit more of a bite it would be absolutely stellar, although once you're halfway through the pint as it is, you already want another.

Pours into a pint glass a dark amber with hints of ruby. Pretty potent hop aroma on this one, very leafy and herbal. I expected this to be a hop bomb based on the reviews but I was surprised. It's a very good red ale, but it is very bitter and the hops don't give off too much flavor. Big sweet malt backbone and some leafy and piney hops. Medium body leaning towards heavy. A good beer but I'm a bit disappointed. I'll have to try again to see if it is a fluke.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 I reviewed this a few years ago. Time for an update.  Fresh 12 oz can.  Pours red/Amber with white fluffy head.  Aroma is disappointing since there is no big hop bouquet.  Tastes of sweet malts and well balanced, but mild hops. Not bitter at all.  Nice creamy mouthfeel.  Overall, fresh, clean, tasty, and an easy drinker.

Dangerously drinkable at 7.5 abv and showcases some of the best of American hops. Demonstrates that you can make an amazing hop forward beer outside of the standard pale ale or ipa classification.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Aroma is citrus, wet hops and pine. The flavor is citrus, earthy malts, grapefruit, hop resin notes and a bitter/slightly tangy finish.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 I'm not a big fan of very bitter beers and I'm just pleasantly confused about this beer. This beer has 93 IBU which would make you think this beer will turn your face inside out with bitterness but for whatever reason (perhaps it being a red ale?) the malts counter the bitterness to the point where this beer is actually enjoyable without giving you a bitter beer face. It has the aspects of an IPA (the hop taste and grapefruit note) but the malts really make this beer great. The pine notes are usually the ones that are the most unpleasant to me in IPAs and the pine taste is very subtle in this beer. I'm not sure if my palette is changing though. 93 IBU normally means I'm not going to like the beer. This beer has proven that theory wrong. Although I'm drinking this beer 2-3 months after I bought it. I'm not sure if it aged the beer at all. Hopefully I can try a fresh beer in the future and remember how this tasted.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 3-27-15. Water goblet. Bottled on 1-20-15.    Appearance: Smoke on the pop. Pours a deep copper with a 1.5 finger rocky, sandy head. Moderate carbonation. Clear with a few lazy bubble streams. Very nice lacing. A few islands of retention.    Aroma: Guava, Mango, resin, floral, sweet, sugary, definitely hoppy aroma. High on the hops, high on the malt, too.    Taste: Dryer arrival than expected, but malty. Malty with some caramel across mid-palate, turning to a solid, bitter finish, but overly so. Bitternes at the end is a bit much for me.     Mouthfeel: Hefty, but not heavy. Decent/moderate carbonation. Not much slickness.    Overall: Definitely an imperial amber; balanced, with Big Hops and Big Malt. Just a very BIG beer all the way around. I like it, but I can't see myself drinking this regularly.
