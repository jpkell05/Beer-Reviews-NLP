T: Sweetness definitely shines through. Hop forward with a good malt backbone. Top of my mouth is bitter while my tongue is sweet. Definitely a new sensation. Finishes with an interesting taste. Pine nuts?    O: Quality brew with an interesting twist. The name is well deserved. Alcohol is undetectable for a 10% beer. So smooth.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Quite a nice strong ale with some well-balanced malt and hoppy notes. Pours a honeyed caramel-amber color with a little bit of head and lingering lacing. Smells mainly of brown sugar, malt, caramel and a little trace of herbal hops. Taste follows the nose, in addition to some brown sugar, molasses and raisin. Almost reminded me of a stronger version of a barleywine. Smooth, mild, slightly thinner mouthfeel with decent carbonation. Higher ABV was fairly well-hidden.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 A bourbon hue without much head and dissipates quickly. Caramel brown sugar nose. Hits with hops first, then you get the caramel sweetness, then a bitter finish. Well-balanced but also not that complex. Pretty easy and tasty to drink for a strong ale. Could spend an evening with this.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a golden honey color, with a eggshell / very light brown foam head of 1-2 fingers. It has a sweet aroma with a heavy malty biscuit flscor with moderate caramel and pine overtones. Despite being 10% APV, it does not have an overwhelming alcohol taste but is very intense with malt and caramel. It is somewhat fik yet does not set too heavy. Overall it is a another good seasonal offering from Lagunitas.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Normally, I don't like sweet high alcohol beers. This is an exception. It pours with a nice thick and persistent head. The color is a nice deep amber. The head laces nicely as it settles. Nose is nothing special. The mouth feel is thick and smooth. It is sweet but there is enough alcohol and hops bite to balance it.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 This is a good beer, but not as much of a sugar bomb as I expected based on the marketing hype. The hops (51 IBUs) mask the sweetness somewhat and the alcohol is very well hidden. This beer tastes like a barleywine/American strong ale that leans sweet. I would have preferred lower hop bitterness so that the sweet malt could shine through more, but this is a pretty good offering and a great value for the price.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Nice clear, light brown color with beige head. Lacing was decent. Smell is a little sweet and definitely displays alcohol content. Flavor is malty, sweet, and boozie and finishes bitter and crisp.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 From notes 10/29/12: Pours a clear, coppery amber producing 2+ fingers of frothy, variously bubbled, beige, moderately lasting head that leaves beautiful webs and bubbles of lace. The degree of lace left behind is variable from purchase to purchase. Aroma is biscuit and toasted malt, brown sugar, figs and hints of caramel, fruity candied apple, yeast, alcohol, pine and citrus hops. Taste is similar to the nose with the fruit being vinous throughout; the alcohol more noticeable as warmth and spice form mid-sip into the aftertaste; and more pine resin and citrus hop flavors especially in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, thick and warming it has a dry finish.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 12 Oz Bottle poured into glass  Look - Golden amber color, lots of bubbles, medium foam head has decent retention and thick glass lacing  Smell - like a very sweet IPA...can pick up hops but the overall aroma is sweet like a sugary syrup  Taste - It's certainly sweet no doubt about that. Initial strong bitter hop flavor turns into a sugar rush and heavy malts. Body is medium-high. Carbonation is medium. High ABV is mostly disguised as this feels like a simple IPA with a fuller body.  The kind of beer that is easy to drink but I'm not sure I would want more than one..    Overall, it's better than the rating suggests. It really packs a punch in both flavor and ABV. I liked it even though it is super sweet and will look for it again as a single, not something i need to buy a six pack of. Grade is an A-   
look: 4 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 2.75 just taste like an average IPA, way too much hopes.... Overall not a bad beer if you’re going for an IPA but I was expecting more of a Strong Christmas ale or a Strong Amber Ale

Smell - Weak notes of the titular brown sugar, sweet caramel malt, peanut butter. A very weak smell, but a pleasant one.    Taste - Short bread cookies is the flavor of the day here. Sweet, malty, and refreshing.    Feel - A medium chunky body with with a decently appropriate carbonation. A smooth drinker.    Overall - This is a malt lover's dream. Full of sweet bready flavors and incredibly drinkable, I almost wish it was weaker so I could drink more.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Copper filtered with little carbonation and 2 fingers of off white head.    Smells slightly of caramel, then dank, pot like hops.    Tastes slightly sweet of brown sugar, then of dank, west coast hops, catnip, green leaf, and a hint of bitterness.    Medium body with moderate carbonation. Really covers the alcohol.    Got at Walmart, and drinking for the first time in Redding, CA. Excellent brew.

They are unique and Not for everybody. First off, this will f&*& you up, compared to other beers at a similar ABV this one would consistently put me to sleep for some reason after just one. It's really sweet but not particularly molasses-y; though that comes through, its not as carmelized as a darker beer. I was expecting big things but it was not something I will try again.

I am a novice reviewer and take what I say with a grain of salt. Cut to the brass tax, I liked this beer but it won't make my favorites list.  I was expecting a real sweet taste and I must be one of the oddballs out there because I didn't taste much sweetness at all.  I drank it straight from the bottle, did I mention that I am a novice? One person mentioned a slight grapefruit taste and I agree. Another person said you could never tell that this is a 10% beer I agree with that too, absolutely no alcohol burn. Brown Shugga' goes down real easy, I am a sipper, not a guzzler but if I was I might be tko'd. This beer has very little bitterness in my opinion. Try this beer you might like it, one thing I can't get over is how much my experience with this beer is different than others.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Very pleasant, strong smell right from the bat. Taste has after kick to it, makes your tongue a bit numb in all those flavor. Definitely has that rich smell and taste of sweetness in it. Strangely the resulting feel is a bit weak compared to its strong smell and flavor. But still enjoyable beer. Love the high alcohol volume.

The fact that this ale happened by accident adds to the awesomeness of this ale. Hearty, balanced, refreshing and perfect for this time of year when the weather can't decide if it is season appropriate or not. If you aren't a fan if huge sugar, malt and hops, this one is not for you and on the other hand this one is for you in so many great ways.     Final thoughts - at nearly 10% abv and less than $10 a six pack, what more could you ask for from a brewery that has mastered the seasonal ale

Normal pour into a brandy snifter produces a half inch of slightly off but otherwise white head, nice retention with a still frothy collar, deep amber body, decent lacing    Aroma is awkwardly light, I guess the age could have effected it but it’s not very old, I remember it being stronger before but it’s been months, literally can’t smell anything but a hint of booze so I gotta write it off as my nose being weird today..     Taste is slightly bitter hops the first few sips but really mellows out into a sweet barley-like malt, slightly dry with some biscuit notes    Feel is lowly carbonated, slightly thicker then other comparable strong ales, no alcohol burn    Overall it’s another solid offering from lagunitas, I think the aging brought it down from what I remember so drink fresh..     That being said it’s still not the most memorable I’ve had from them but definitely worth a try.

Off white head settles to bubbly cap. Some strings of lacing.  Caramel malt and hops in the nose.  Sweeter taste malts, piney and citrus hops. Strong tastes throughout.  Medium mouth feel.  A strong, sweet tasting ale, quite well balanced with the malts and the hops. Alcohol burn is present.

The first time I had it I thought I tasted strong brown sugar but this time it's my first beer of the night and I don't taste it. There is some bitter to the finish. Overall it's not bad and I would recommend trying it but I wouldn't buy it again.

A little bit of yeast sediment.    S: Sweet caramel and brown sugar (no surprise) mixed with lagunitas hops.    T/F: Follows the nose. Sweet brown sugar and caramel malts. Well balanced by the hops... piney and citrus. Floral... sweet.. ABV not subtle. Medium bodied... sticky and carbonated. The finish is more brown sugar and hops.    O: A delicious strong ale. Super drinkable despite the noticeable ABV. A few of these would be super dangerous. Delicious beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 taken from notes> 297 72 2380 0135 marked on bottle.     Appearance- from a hardy pour into a pint glass it's a transparent amber color with a frothy off white head that leaves thick heavy lacing.     Aroma- dank and citrus. hoppy. nice.     Flavor- tastes like the smell but with a heavy chocolate malt presence. abv is really noticable. pretty sharp in the booze department.     Mouthfeel- medium/ heavy bodied. alil silky. good carbonation.     Drinkability- def going to drink more of this in the future. really nice for the winter.     Overall- i was expecting a more malty of a brew but coming from lagunitas this one isn't neglecting the hops. to me this is a really nice imperial ipa brewed with a ton of specialty malts (chocolate and maybe oats).

Pours rich copper with a little head, just right..    Smells floral and sweet, I get grapefruit also.    Aah, the glorious sip! SO JUICY! RIch and syrupy, tastes of citrus - a mix of sweets and tarts. No taste of strong alcohol at all.    Mouthfeel is also glorius, not thin like many beverages - almost syrupey. Fizz is solid.    Finish is clean.    This is a favorite go-to high-gravity brew!

Off-dry dankness with lingering pine and grapefruit zest.    Mouthfeel  Medium bodied, silky, smooth, moderately bitter, and off-dry.    Overall  HIGHly malty with a tropical hop bitterness that cuts the sweetness well. Molasses, toffee, and a brown sugar dryness stand out.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pours a lovely mahogany color with a thick, white head that is slow to fade and clings nicely to the glass. Smell is fresh baked bread, pine, and a little grapefruit pith. Taste is grapefruit up front, dark fruits and malt in the middle, fading to a sweet, almost cloying finish that takes a long time to fade. Fully body. Slow winter sipper, delicious in every stage, flirts with being too sweet and yet somehow doesn't cross that line.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pretty beer. Like light molasses. I can mostly smell the alcohol. The taste matches the name - brown shugga and strong ale. A sweet, late night sipper.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.     Appearance: Pours a clear, deep copper with 1/2 finger of white head    Smell: Piney hop aromas and baked bread    Taste: Hop bitterness up front with plenty of dark fruit and malt in the middle leading to a slightly sweet, boozy finish that reminds you how big this beer is    Mouthfeel: Full body and heft, cloying in the finish    Overall: This beer is not about balance at all in my opinion. But thats what this one is all about. Up front it has a lot of character of an American-style barley wine with the aggressive hop character, yet the malt comes in and hits you even harder leaving the boozy finish. Yet, I still go right back for the next sip.    A winter-warmer for sure.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Served from the bottle, 2017 seasonal brew into a chilled mug. A bit of a thin light brown, creme colored,head, good up front hoppy burnt roast flavor. Seems to taste like grapefruit and a hint of juniper scent in there too. Looong finish on the hops that sits in the back on the roof of your mouth, a finish I enjoy. It is a little bit warm on the finish, a very slight hint of alcohol hot, but well concealed by the loads of hoppiness on the back end. I would buy this again in a heart beat. Really nice finish as the last of the contents warms up a bit. A full rich hoppy California style Ale. Exceptional value if you can get a case of it for the Holidays.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Overall a delicious American strong ale. Finishes smoother than most in this category. This is a release I look forward to In the holiday season. It would be my go-to if it was available year round

Caramel malt, pungent weedy, grassy hops.  Earthy, slight sweetness - molasses like. Earthy, root-like hopiness. Grainy.   Full body, slick...well carbonated. Lengthy finish. Sweet up front but enough hops to balance.  Transcends styles..kind of like Arrogant Bastard did when it was new....interesting beer.

More of a dirty penny color, dingy off white head, had to describe it as having an IPA crispness, or a dominant maltiness. Very smooth, really well balanced between the hope and malts. Have to agree with others, the 10% alcohol is a slow, pleasant, warm surprise! Be very careful with this one! And oh yeah, I really like this ale. Using one to simmer a small ham in for the first weekend of Deer Camp! Enjoy!

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 Look: amber, tons of bubbles, huge off white head, plenty of lacing. What more could you ask for?    Smell: fresh, hoppy, citrusy, fruity, smells like a well done IPA     Taste: huge hops that mix bitterness with citrus and tropical fruit, balanced by a solid maltiness, faint brown sugar     Feel: medium carbonation, smooth and creamy    Overall: not as sweet as I was expecting, very faint brown sugar and huge hops. One of the most deceptive and least boozy 10% brews I've ever had. I feel like I don't like this as much as my rating indicates but it is a very good beer, it's objectively well made, and I'd be remiss to lower any part of it. Great beer for the price as well.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Pours a nice clear deep copper with an irregular little foamy beige head with tons of sticky lacing.  Smells sticky if that is possible, syrupy, almost sickeningly sweet with warm stone fruit, red grapes, brown sugar, some molasses and caramel, a little grapefruit, and maybe even something like baked apples.  Taste is sweet and congruent with the smell with an unexpected, bitter, hoppy back. The hops are pungent, dank, as well as citrusy and grapefruity and you suddenly understand their contribution to the aroma. You were smelling them the whole time but didn’t realize it was the hops contributing a sweet fruity smell.  Body is medium in terms of weight but a bit syrupy from the sugar and resinous from the hops, all balanced out into mouth coating goodness. I seriously can’t believe it’s 10% ABV. I also can’t understand why this isn’t rated higher.  Much better that Arrogant Bastard and most other American strong ales out there.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Why all "4's" in every category, but a "4.5" overall you ask?  Because this smooth operator will get you WRECKED son!  One of, if not THE, best American Strong Ales I've ever had.  Super smooth, alcohol barely noticeable, and tasty! Which was part of the problem for me.  Took an entire SIXER to the face while watching a hockey game one evening.... woke up on the lawn.  Good stuff!

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 A perfect example of an american strong ale. Nice copper colour with a tan head and some nice lacing. Smells of caramel and mild malts.

Two of these and a comfy blanket will make for a great winter nights sleep. Prost!

I don’t think I could drink more than 2 or 3, it’s quite strong. Very filling. Highly recommend for the sake of something different if nothing else.

The beer pours bright red hued amber with sticky light khaki head. The head never really goes away and spotty lacing is present all over the glass. The aroma is pine first with some citrus. The taste is semisweet caramel first before a rush of piney, citrusy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, adequately carbonated, sticky but somehow dryish in the finish. Overall, great. I love this beer. A very fine example of big malt and big hop bitterness interacting in the best possible way.

It has a little bit of a darker reddish color with a fingers worth of white head. It actually smells pretty damn hoppy with some tropical apricot and pine smell . Taste is semi bitter on the front followed by a little sweetness from the malts, kinda caramel type sweetness. it had a fairly thick chewy mouthfeel and definitely would be a beer I would buy again.

The appearance was a hazy brown colored body leaving a one finger white foamy head that appears and leaves some nice slightly thick yet spotty lacing in rings around the sides of the pint glass. The body is too hazy for any carbonation to be seen rising. The smell had the hops up front to form a mostly bitter aroma. The malts play nicely in the background coming more forward as the beer warms. The taste was excellent as the hops and the malts combine just about perfectly. On the palate, she sat about a slight sticky feel in my mouth and on the tongue, ranging on the medium side. Though the ABV is pretty high, this is quite drinkable. Overall, I’m thoroughly impressed and most likely will have this again.

Malt,sugar,followed by perhaps fruit and mild hops. The alcohol effected the taste a bit as it was a bit overwheming. Malt and brown sugar was forefront but there was some mild hop finish . It was a well made beer and very unique but not something I could drink a lot of. People who appreciate craft beer should definitely give this a try just to experience something different

S- fruity malt, Christmas spirit wafting on the west wind!  Taste- a complex yet cozy, wholesome affair, the label of this six pack states a 9.7%, which is well hidden, yet a big, big beer it is, it's potency lingers on the mouth's roof, while the holiday spice-tinged citrus and other fruits explode with each precious gulp, lol    Feel / Overall Too strong for causal drinking, a sipper indeed, warming like an Imperial, but not the 'burning down the throat' sensation, that several Lagunitas Imperial Stouts have provided me in the last couple of rainy ( rather pleasant) months ... after numerous (Imperial) Stouts, this is a refreshing, complex, well-balanced fruity, malty change of pace!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Deep amber holiday ale. Its a good strong ale with rich flavors. You can taste the malt presence in this beer, but the hops are there too.

Smell has aromas of brown sugar, oily floral/grassy hops, sweet malts, and touch of fruit - notes of citrus.    Taste follows the nose with a strong sweetness up front giving way to a surprisingly bitter hoppy finish. Lots of orange peel, brown sugar, caramel and pine. Pretty sweet overall. Pleasant malty base comes through     Feel has mild carbonation. Thick sticky mouthfeel thats likely from the sweetness. Dry finish.     Overall its a pretty good beer- solid old ale.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 12oz bottle poured in to a tulip.     Appearance is amber and ruby and golden, befitting the holiday season. Id have certainly enjoyed it as a Christmas brew had I been aware of it then. Head was generous and creamy, retention was pleasing because it stuck around long enough to admire and not long enough to get in the way of a clean sip.     The smell is great, very unique and sweet. You pick up vanilla and malt as well as pine and hops. The citrus qualities were unexpected but fitting. Again, a great Christmastime brew.     Taste is top notch. sweet malt and sugar are in the front. I would describe the sugars as "toasty" or slightly burnt. Pine and citrusy hops are present on the palate in the finish, allowing the beer some very refreshing qualities that distinguish it immediately from a sweet stout or anything of the sort.     Mouthfeel is smooth and balanced, the sweetness being present without ever being syrupy or heavy and the pine and citrus are in the mix without ever being too dry or astringent. Alcohol is undetectable despite the high ABV so take care not to get too drunk, cause it'd be easy to knock these back all night long.     Overall, unique and beautiful brew. Outstanding.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Look is a deep amber, with a thick and creamy head.

Extra points for this brew being so flavorful, so alcoholic , and so drinkable at once. It's like a barleywine, but disguised as a sweet and spicy holiday beer (albeit a rich one). Very unique to my experience.     have had this on tap a few times (the first time I did not realize the abv and had 3)

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Bottled on the 357th day of 2016. Consumed on 1/14/2017. Pretty fresh! Around 3 weeks old. I give this beer a B+/A- :)    L: The beer is a golden/amber color combo. I didn't pour the beer aggressive enough so I had a one finger head that dissipated, but leaves a trail on your glass as it's consumed.     S: As its name suggests, this beer has a sweet and very unique smell to it. Sweet malts with some citrussy pine mixed in there upon pouring,, but as the beer warms the sweet malts become the dominant aroma. Very unique and hard to describe at first.    T: Just like the aroma, this beer has a very unique taste. It tastes and smells kind of like a "prettier" Arrogant Bastard. Fairly sweet, caramel malts, with some citrus/pine notes that come through at the end. As the beer warms, the caramel malt becomes the much more dominant flavor. The alcohol is very well hidden, you would not be able to tell it's a 9.7% beer, very impressive and dangerous ;).    F:I think this beer is easy drinking. Lighter side of medium carbonation. Balanced    Overall to me this is a great, nicely executed, and very unique beer. The most similar beer I've tried to this is the Arrogant Bastard, but that doesn't say much because they are still very different. The 6 pack was $12 and which is such a great value. Lagunitas is becoming my favorite brewery, because they make great beers and their value is almost unparalleled.     Would I buy this gain? Yeah probably next year. Not really an everyday beer to me, but probably something I would not want to miss out on when its released. Cheers! :)

Has a savory smell to it with a hint of that wonderful brown sugar it's named after, sort of thick in mouthfeel...full and satisfying on the pallet. I can hardly taste the alcohol at all. I love the color, the slight haze in the pour and pretty much everything about it. Little bit of hippiness on the back end but I don't think that's really what this beer is about, but it's there anyway. Good job Lagunitas.

The look is closer to an Amber than I would expect of a debatably "dark" beer, but in terms of all other criteria, this pup lives up to the name. I saw Lagunitas' brewmaster describe this as "technically a barleywine," which makes sense, as barleywines are my thing next to never, given their black licorice and raisin business, and I won't say that I would drink this regularly, but should I have a slab of pumpkin pie before me, and grandma holding a gun to my head (she's that kind of lady), Brown Shugga would go down just fine.

That being said, this is a well made beer. I've been drinking this 12 oz bottle from my favorite glassware for the past hour, and it's retained a fine head and beer still laces when I take a swig. It's relatively balanced for a big, boozy beer. I personally would prefer a little more biscuit and roast for balance. However, nice hop nose, good bittering. Call it an American Strong of Malt-focused Double IPA, this is a solid, big American Ale. What you'd expect from Lagunitas.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Lagunitas makes some intense brews, and this is a good example. 9.7% abv. 1.100 o.g. 51 ibu.     Dark honey/amber color. Mid sized foam cap, solid white. Decent lacing left over.    Thickly sweet malt bomb aroma. Caramel scented malt with some red fruits and tangy citrus from the hops. Smells like fruity whisky.    Freshly poured from the bottle and into a mini snifter glass, the flavor has a very intense fruity hop kick, high alcohol heat buzz and a long, caramel-sweet malt that turns, woody or cask-like. I'm imagining this stuff out of the barrel!     A massive full body, nice crisp punch that mellows to long, slick malty finish. I'm thinking of pairing this with smoked cheddar cheese at some point, if I have any of this beastie liquid left by the time I'm hungry.     With Big, strong ale's I find it important to comment on how well the flavor changes as the liquid warms. After all, you really should sip on this or you may become too drunk, too early in the night. Go slow, and let it warm up some. Usually the malt gets more complex and sweeter.     I believe this style of ale is what Kings and Vikings would drink if they came back to rule the world, or if this type of brew was around then.....although, maybe they would demand a Gold colored brew......anyway.......    As it warms, the aroma strengthens, more fruity hops, bigger , sweet, cask barrel malty tones come out.     I'm thinking of this brew to be the Mike Tyson of beer. Just F'in rugged, street smart, slightly ignorant, but demanding respect....always. It's giving me major attitude as I type this. Pretty sure it wants to take a swing.    Big in all ways, complex and honestly, the balance is just right for this style. Que to Stones song.....

I hate the word aroma, so I'm gonna say I smell some malts and piney, citrusy hops.  This has a nice sweetness upfront and a mild citrus finish.  This is one of those beers that sneaks up on you. The ABV is well hidden. Another terrific offering from Lagunitas.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Poured from bottle into tulip, monster 2 finger light tan head, recedes rather slowly, great lacing. Darkish amber in the glass, crystal clear to look at. Smells of malt, crystal, caramel some pine on the nose. This is an in your face caramel sweetness on the front end, followed up by piny citrus hops in the middle with a mild bitterness and finishes up with malt sweetness. Very thick almost syrupy mouthfeel, great mouthfeel. I like this, and don't mind having it every now and then, but this one is just a little too sweet for me to drink quite frequently. I grabbed a six pack of this last winter and never got around to rating it. I told myself I just didn't like it and didn't know if I would finish the six pack but that puppy disappeared rather quickly, so maybe subconsciously I like this more than I think.

Good caramel color like dark brown sugar, smells a little spicy, good balance of bitter and sweet. You would never know this is 9.7% in a blind taste. Alcohol is hidden well.     After reading some other reviews, I'm noticing more pine-hops smell than citrus, but a better balance of the two in the taste. Burps feel like a Christmas tree.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Translucent dark brown from a refrigerated Spec's down here in Beaumont, TX. Just 2 months old, only running for a few months this time a year anyway.    Anyway, dark but mostly translucent brown/mildly amber ale. Lots of lacing.    Smell is very muted, some barley, grains, and dominatively malty. Taste is somewhat similar in that aspect, with a lighter mouth feel then many malty beers. Pretty easy mouthful, not much carbonation though. Alcohol well hidden but not an overwhelmingly pleasing beer.     That being said it's not a bad deal for the warm winter buzz the beer provides. When each beer (9.7%) is equal to 2 of the strongest macros it's hard to complain. I imagine at higher alcohols with this style it's hard to make everyone completely happy. That being said Stone among many other companies do so without a problem.    They claim it has a moderately high IBU but I can't detect many hops in the ale. Pretty much a heavy malt bomb with the advantage of it being lower medium bodied in order to quaff it down easily. Gets you very drunk very fast, and for the money I can't complain. I love a nice heavy beer buzz.

This was my first craft beer I ever tried after I first turned 21, so this is a re-review. Over the past year I've tried over 450 beers and this one has only improved with my new tastes. Love it!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 L -- Pours a lovely reddish amber with a two finger, densely foamy, off-white head. Head dissipates slowly, and leaves significant lacing on the glass.   S -- Equal parts citric hops and caramely malts. Faint aromas of peach, pineapple, and brown sugar  T -- True to its name, brown sugar! dominates with a nice biscuity malt backbone. Pineapple and boozy flavors also shine through. Not nearly as hoppy as other popular Lagunitas releases  F -- At 9.7% ABV, it's hard to not to have a full and robust mouthfeel. The sugary sweetness is not overpowering, but balances the high alcohol and maltiness well. No strange aftertastes  O -- One of my new favorites    90/100    EDIT (11/27/17):  I think my taste for sweet beers has developed since I last reviewed this, since it's not quite as good as I remember it being. Still has a beautiful, reddish amber body with a nice head. Aromas and flavors, though, are much more one-dimensionally 'sugar' than I recall. Still pretty good for the price    85/100

Being I'm a stout guy and not so much a hop head, this is a great combination.  I only bought one to try, , ,but I'm grabbing some sixers to have as I was very pleased with this brew. :)  Very refreshing taste and palate change from my heavy brews .   Highly recommended for many reasons . Taste, combo, price and high abv :) ;)

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Look - a golden amber with a two-finger off-white head and spotty lacing.  Smell - citrusy hops, brown sugar, and caramel malts all mix together very well.  Taste - this beer is very unique, it follows the nose but this combination of flavors is so bizarre, but in a good way.  Feel - great carbonation, full and slightly chewy body, and smooth finish.  Overall, I can't make sense of this beer but the complexity draws me in. I want to age some bottles to see how it develops.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 Nice amber color and smells great, but the important thing is the taste. I purchased without looking at the alcohol content. This is a sipper, as it will warm the belly as it goes down. Pretty well balanced for a beer with this high of alcohol content. Overall, it is not my cup of "beer", as I prefer ales/ipas where I can throw back three or four. If I make it through this I will be done for the night - call me a "light weight". Well worth trying once, but I won't be coming back for more. Those who run-a-way live to play another day! Overall, my lower rating is based on this just not being my style.   Update: Half way thru and liking it more and more. Sips are becoming larger. Maybe I will have another....

This tastes much different than my normal beer selections. Interesting but sweet and slightly bitter at the same time. Alcohol content is fairly well hidden. I'm almost tasting some Euro skunk in the aftertaste, very yeast like. Having a hard time trying to compare this to anything else I've had. It's a big beer and creamy but not too carbonated. Afterthought.... this is some powerful stuff ! Upping my overall score by .25

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 How on earth have I never reviewed this before?    First off, kudos to Lagunitas for releasing such a strong, wonderful seasonal so widely, and doing so while keeping the cost solidly below east coast local offerings. As much as I appreciate the efforts of the fancy-beard crew at Cumwater brewing, or whatever the local place is called, I can't justify spending 15 bucks for a four-pack of their so-so beer when I can buy this for 11 a sixer.    This pours a dark amber that's not really brown but kind of like sunstruck brown sugar. Nice heard and fierce effervescence, for a beer of its strength.    Smells like a US old ale or strong ale: lots of stuff going on, stylistically intense and messy but never getting out of hand. Aggressive, old school west coast hops against super duper intense amber malt.    Tastes like it smells: a wonderful goddamn mess. It's not bitter and then fruity, like most very hoppy American beers, nor is it at all fruity heavy. It's just bitter and then sweet. Aggressive, bright, piney hops and then aggressive, sugary, bready malt.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 The best beer I've ever had. I stumbled across this last winter in Texas, not realizing it was a seasonal. Had I known, I'd have bought out every six-pack I could find. I didn't know beer could be like this. I've always preferred dark, malty beers over the IBU-laden ales that seem to dominate the craft beer industry. Brown Shugga is the hoppy beer I've waited my whole life for. It represents the perfect blending of bitterness and malt, sweetness and bite. The only misgiving I have about it, and it's a very small one, is the volume of alcohol. It's only a liability because it prevents me from drinking as much of it as I'd like. A 10 ounce tulip of this stuff is really all my brain can handle in the evening after work, but my tastebuds scream for two and my tastebuds almost always win out.     It pours with a thick tan head and leaves the most beautiful lacing ever, like the wind-whipped contrail of an old Saturn V. It's thick on the tongue, but astringent as it goes down. it's almost a shame to drink it because it looks so beautiful in the glass...dark rum reds, golden brown sugar syrup...the most beautiful beer you've ever seen.     It's a belly-warmer, to be sure, and is just sweet enough to go with a gooey chocolate or gingerbread cake. Otherwise, I'd be inclined to drink this nectar all on its own.     Lagunitas has become my single favorite brewery and this is my single favorite of their beers. Just amazing!

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Full disclosure: I normally dislike beer over about 25 IBU. This one clocks in at 51. I have to say, though, that this one is pretty tolerable for a beer style I don't go for. The hop taste is very fresh and floral rather than the usual sour gym sock you normally get with overhopped beers. The sweetness of the brown sugar taste also balances out the hop bitterness pretty well. I won't personally buy again but for those that like a hopped beer this one will be great.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Standard pour from a 12 oz. bottle into a nonic pint yields a clear deep amber colored ale, topped by an imposing three finger tall cream head. Retention and lacing are both superb.    Nose is hops-forward, pine-y, with and underlying fruity sweetness and toasted malt.    Flavors come in sweet- caramel, toffee, along with lighty toasted biscuit. Fruit notes of apricot and dark cherries come in through the mid-palate, along with some clove-like spice, finishing dry with fairly strong pine hops and lingering molasses.    Feel is medium-full, creamy, with fairly light carbonation and a subtle alcohol warmth that very much belies the stiff 9.8% ABV punch it delivers (this is a beer that can and will sneak up on you, be warned.)    I have to admit, it took me a while to "get" this one... I had purchased a six-pack of this approximately seven months ago (Lagunitas doesn't seem to put a date on their bottles, so I can't tell precisely how old this is.) While I remember thinking it was a good beer back then, the sweetness was quite brash and the finish somewhat overly hopped to be as great as it could be. However aging seems to have brought out the best in this; The sweeter notes from the brown sugar used in the brewing have matured and now work very harmoniously with those now more evened-out evergreen hops. That combined with the burly but appropriate alcohol make Brown Shugga' an outstanding strong ale. I would urge anyone trying this to not write it off right away if it doesn't suit them- put a few up for a bit instead. Your patience may very well be rewarded.

Quite clear and bubbly  S: Smells quite nice, hard to describe though. Dark fruit notes present like that of a dobbelbock or dubbel. Has some floral hop notes as well, sort of spicy on the nose. Toast also present.  T: Really good, only complaint is it is a little over hopped. A lot of the nose repeats but its quite bitter, somewhat piney and resinous, though clean.  F: Very crisp, but very bitter which gives an astringency and takes away from what would be a more refreshing beer. Body is pretty light and smooth otherwise.  O: Pretty solid and I really like it. Will probably have this again if I see it.

I thought I could pass it off on someone eventually. And after awhile, like deciding to have a second child, I couldn't remember what was so awful about having the 1st, I said "sure, let's try this again". I am glad I did. The sugars must have eaten away at everything I found so unpleasant the first go around. Aging really helped this one and now I am sad I only have 4 left.

The aroma offers caramel, molasses, pine, plums, candied orange peel, cherries, and dried apricots.  On the palate, you get a nicely balanced malt sweetness. Lots of caramel, molasses, and toasted bread. Near the finish you get dark fruits; red cherries, plums, figs, and dried apricots. The finish is mostly caramelized sugar sweet, but with some balancing pine, and a light alcohol warmth.  The mouthfeel is medium-full, medium-light carbonation, and smooth and creamy.    Good stuff. It tastes very similar to a barleywine. Less complex, but maybe more drinkable. Another winner from Lagunitas.

It has a very creamy mouth feel with a ton of cherry caramel on the front end and a mellow sweet finish. There is very little hops in the beer. The alcohol is nicely hidden (much like many of the big beers that Lagunitas puts out) so be careful with this one - it drinks like an amber but will take you down like a Tripel. I almost think if they made this with a Belgium yeast it would taste very Belgium. It's a great beer for the style.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.25 Poured at 50°F from a 12oz bottle (2015 release) into a snifter. Consumed on 28Feb16.  LOOK: Pours with a fingers worth of khaki foam that dissipates into a line within 45 seconds. Copper in color with a slight amount of cloudiness. Rising bubbles are medium in size and moderate in quantity. There is an abundance of small, grayish white particles floating throughout the beer. I'm not sure what they are. Lacing is thin and subtle.  SMELL: Strong aromas of molasses, tree nuts, plums, figs, and black cherries entangle with mild leather, caramel, sweet bread, and brown sugar aromas along with subtle hop aromas of pine, oranges, tangerines, and grapefruit.   TASTE: Strong molasses, fig, plum, and black cherry flavors first enter into to the palate. Mild hop flavors of orange, tangerine, and grapefruit immediately follow and bring balance to the sweetness. Mild caramel and brown sugar and subtle leather flavors further unveil the taste profile. Subtle flavors of tree nuts, vanilla (that wasn't in the aroma), piney hops, and bitter hops enter lastly as all previous flavors persist.  FEEL: Full-bodied and subtly carbonated. Goes down smooth and creamy. Finishes very dry. A mild and welcoming alcoholic warmth can be felt as it goes down the throat.  NOTE: A great beer for being one that is massed produced and distributed. This reminded me of an American Barleywine, without the intense hop flavors. Everything was nice a balanced here.

The hops grabbed ahold of my tongue and would not let go... in fact, I was worried I might not get my tastebuds back.  Determined not to buy this again, this wild stallion rears its head again in a 6 pack brought as a gift by a neighbor who we invited over for dinner.  Then, Brown Shugga' sits in my cellar for a year; thinking we might get along better if it has time to mellow.  I drank it last night and. speechless, could not write a review.  Nor could I finish it. Nor would I pour it down the drain out of respect to everyone who likes this beer.  So, I let it sit overnight in an uncovered tulip.  I had a sip first thing in the AM before I made my coffee.  Brown Shugga' was better... but still not good for me.  Moral of the story: mellowing with age is a relative thing.

All were good, however the older ones were the better ones: the aged versions were not as aggressive, were more complex, and were perhaps more creamy; some of the others agreed. This beer seems to age very well. Increasing Taste and Overall.    2nd one, 4 months old. 3rd one, 1/1/2017: damn good sweet, American strong ale or barleywine, whatever you want to call it.

Feel is creamy, light carbonation, thick finish.....good beer, but I don’t think I would want more than 1 in a Row.

I get this every year and will continue to do so.

Pours a deep, slightly hazy copper-orange with half a finger of light khaki head that leaves under-construction city skyline lace as it recedes.    Smells of big caramel malt, stewed citrus fruit, tropical fruit, toast with brown sugar and a lot of perfumed, piney hops.    Tastes of spiced orange preserve, roasted caramel malt, raw brown sugar, raisin tarts and more bitter piney hops.    Feels big and sturdy. Full bodied with creamy and supportive carbonation. Finishes dry    Verdict: Highly recommended. It won't tickle your sweet tooth, though.

T - A big, complex malt profile comes right out the gate. Starting as a heavy, toasty caramel, the malt flavor becomes more layered and reminiscent of a doppelbock in its sweetness, toastiness, biscuit notes, and viscosity. An earthy, spicy, slightly berry-like hop character near the back end of the palate along with a subtle boozy bite. Finish is sweet, and surprisingly bitter.    M - Full-bodied, not too heavy for such a sweet beer.    O - Somewhere between a Winter Warmer, Doppelbock, and Barleywine, this is a thought-provoking, unique beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 DATE TASTED: January 30, 2016... GLASSWARE: Maudite snifter... OCCASION: helping Shan chop food for a new dish and preparing to show the boys The Desolation of Smaug... APPEARANCE: slightly opaque, sparsely bubbly amber orange brown body... the head is off-white, thick and chunky to begin... then it settles to an erratic, uneven heap of bubbles, soap and clouds--frankly, a surprise for a beer that sports a 9.8 % ABV... AROMA: a blast of raw sugray sweetness, coats the usual suspects in the hop bomb that Lagunitas lights--I sense Citra, the Columbus, the garlic of Summit... being a barleywine, the maltiness is a powerfully sweet, nondescript monolith of bread loaf... PALATE: heavy, slightly syrupy... active at the teeth and equally animated at the end... a force to be reckoned with... TASTE: dank, earthy, resinous and deeply infused with the sugary sweetness of cane; fewer floral notes of which to speak, and the malts solidify a forceful, meal-of-a-glass to experience... offers up a side dish of vegetable overtones, including prune and green bean... OVERALL: Having had--and enjoyed--the Sucks as a substitute, this presents an altogether heavier, sweeter, demanding version of its substitute--just what a barleywine should do...the overall drinking experience is sippable, stoic and contemplative...drinking into dinner,t the beer complimented a skillet comprised of chicken, potatoes, onions, mushrooms, brussel sprouts, and bacon... quite a victory in that consideration....

S: west coast barleywine hops and malt... hints of pine, black pepper, and mint, but full of spice, grapefruit, lemon/lime... little bit of cigarette ash... with a name 'Brown Shugga', I'd prefer to be smelling more of it    T: the hops combined with the up front booze make for a citrus eau de vie light grappa, or something... soft, brown malts lingering in the aftertaste as well as medicinal esters and fading, vaguely herbal bitterness... no bottle date, but this shows some age on the hops (and bready malt)... not much richness in the malt, so despite the smell suggesting something akin to Bigfoot, it's very much (late) hop forward and somewhat drier than expected    F: between the fossilizing hop resins, ostensible dextrins, and generous swells of ethanol, this is a majorly smooth     O: yeah, I wasn't a huge fan of this years ago (actually, this beer almost immediately turned me off to Lagunitas, for years) when I first tried it and time and experience hasn't made me appreciate it more... this is one of those west coast beers that's hopped out of balance for the sake of it and hasn't a distinct identity, despite the name 'Brown Shugga' on the label touting

Reasonable head with some lacing. Strong malt and hops nose. Taste is a pleasant assault of malt, brown sugar, and heavy. The sweetness and the bitterness work very well here. I really like this beer -- has me hoping for more snow so I can earn another couple. Bonus .25 for Lagunitas fun to read labels.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Lagunitas Brown Shugga has a medium, cream-colored head, a clear, bubbly, copper appearance, and a good amount of bubble streams. The aroma is bold, sweet, dank barley malt and hop resin (think brown bread crust and slightly rotted spinach). Taste is of sweet, strong malt and fairly bittern hop notes. Mouthfeel is medium, and Lagunitas Brown Shugga finishes puckering and strong, yet mellow.     RJT

You can definitely feel the brown cane sugar they used on the mouthfeel, nice and rather thick. Taste is hoppy, with citrus notes, but you cant mistake the brown cane sugar though. Finishes just like the taste. Overall, awesome beer for the season, would definitely try again, with care!

Also sweet caramel and brown sugar.  T - This is a unique beer. It starts off hoppy with grapefruit, pine, and lemon notes. After a few sips it gradually turns sweeter and sweeter. The strong hop front seems to lessen and a malty sweet brown sugar taste takes over.  F - This maybe a little on the thin side. It does have a nice dry finish.  O - This is an excellent amber ale. I've always been a fan of this beer. But, I like sweeter beers.

In fact, it was so smooth I drank it much faster than I should have, and, along with the other beers I had, I felt it the next day. But it was worth it!    It's hard to compare this beer to others in the category because I've never had anything quite like it. It's so complex. Just when I thought I'd pinned down a flavor or note, I would detect something else. This is a slow, sipping beer like that of a barleywine or some stouts, especially those aged in bourbon barrels. Yet don't get me wrong: this beer isn't anything like a barleywine or a barrel ag d stout. Again, it's like nothing else I've enjoyed.

Taste, again grassy hop flavors. Bitter with an alcohol presence. A spicy heat to it. Overall, I am just not a big fan of the American strong ale category in general. This is no real exception to that. It's caught in between an iPa, a barley wine, and maybe a Scottish ale. All of which can be delicious. Their three way love child is not my fav though.

Taste is quite hoppy which in it's own way accentuates the sugary taste - cloying flavor. This beer is much better at about 9-11 months when the hoppiness and sugary qualities have faded enough to reveal a more balanced malt profile. It becomes a solid barleywine with a hint of sweetness.    IMO excellent for cellaring

Aroma was not strong, but hinted at the sweetness to come. Taste was sweet malt with a nice brown sugar finish. Feel was smooth and easy, and you have no idea this is a 10% ABV. Dangerously good.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I'm rating this fifth beer from a sixer I purchased a while back, and at this point I've probably overthought this thing too much to review it without bias, but here goes, so chalk any vacillation up to pure ambivalence.    A mountain of tan froth stands atop this brown brew and dissolves slowly until only a few bubbles are left. Herbal hops to the front aroma-wise and a following of medium fruits and perfume. Notes of fruit and sugar are quickly overtaken by a wave of bitterness which is followed by a balancing caramel sweetness. Medium to heavy and the alcohol is barely noticed.    Brown Shugga' is all over the place, off the charts and static and fairly "normal" all at the same time. The dual nature of this beer will make it for some and break it for others. And while I can't pin it down stylistically, I can't really find any definite faults with it either.

The bottle attracted me enough to pick one up. Love the texture on the label. Nice brown coloring and smell of caramel, to me. "Beer Speaks. People Mumble" ABV is high at 9.8%, which is niiiiice! This would go really well with a heavy meal, like stew or something out of a crock pot. I look forward to having again one day.

Smell:Floral, hoppy  Taste: Very bitter (didn't read the IBU until after purchase, my fault), not much brown sugar like I was expecting although it came through a little once my taste got a little numb to the bitterness. Higher ABV was not real noticeable.   Feel: Nothing special to note, good or bad.    Overall: I didn't really care for it. I'm not into the overly hopped beer trend and this one is very hop forward. I think I would have liked it if the bitterness was dialed back. I wouldn't have bought it had I seen the IBU rating prior to purchase, but the name threw me off. Was expecting more of a sweeter malty beer. Not so much.That being said, I did drink the whole 6 (over a few days). I'm sure I would have rated it higher if I was into the bitter beers.

ABV is high but there wasn't too much of the boozy taste. It's a nice beer if you like the bitter.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Pour a clear, amber color with a white head. Smell us very hop forward, citrus, tropical, and alcohol. The smell through me off, was expecting a brown ale by the name but more like a ipa. Taste very bitter, off balance. Bitter and sweetness with some fruity notes and then nasty bitterness to finish. Horrible finishing taste of a bad ipa, not like the other Lagunitas if tried. Has a nice carbonation, very thin. Overall I did not like, and wouldn't recommend or buy again. Maybe I was thrown off by the name expecting more a dark beer, just was not very good to me. The balance was just very off to me, too sweet and bitter combined not good. I have another bottle I'll keep and try again just incase my taste was off tonight.

Smell- Mainly a fruity hop character. Orange, tangerine, pineapple, tropical fruits. Not getting the brown sugar too much, but it's certainly a sweet aroma.    Taste/Feel- A bit disappointed here. Not a bad beer by any means but perhaps overly hopped. Does a "Brown Shugga" beer really need to be 51 IBU? It does more than balance here. In my opinion, it outshines. Growing on me a bit as I drink it, the more caramel, brown sugar notes becoming slightly more apparent, but hops are the real star here.    Glad I tried it, but probably would not seek this one out again.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Wasn't sure what to expect, really. I've had the Lagunitas Sucks, which was a decent enough IPA. Now this is the "Sweet" version of the Brown Shugga...How many different incarnations of the same beer do you really need? Well, I haven't tried to the original Brown Shugga', sadly, but after this beer, I'm more than willing to give it a go.  A: Rather nice ruby/amber color. Surprising. For some reason I was expecting something more golden. Deeper and livelier than I had anticipated.  S: Hops front, which is misleading later on. However, I'm getting nice grapefruit and citrus right off the bat.  M: Full, to medium...which is a weird way to put it, I guess. It's more filling than I would have presumed. This beer is full of surprises!  T: Jeez. Blown away. There are dark fruit immediately. Plum, even a bit of dried apple. Sweet. Finish with a nice dry hoppiness alluded to in the aroma.   O: A sweeter beer than I was expecting, but with all the IPA running rampant in today's market, something a little sweeter doesn't go amiss. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and would recommend it to anyone who likes something a little more complex--something a little sweeter than the average flight set.

Lacing is coarse and sticky along back of glass!  Smell - sweet brown sugar and hops!  Taste - the sweetness from the nose is far more profound in the taste; the syrupy sweetness drowns the hops.  Feel - medium body with overt sweetness throughout.  Overall - does not come across as a barley wine or a strong ale.

Sweet syrupy taste immediately countered by dank piney and citrus rind hop bitterness, powerful. This brew is strong and a bit boozy but so drinkable, it's weird, just kept tasting and it was gone. The flavors just work well together, dangerous. Finish is dry and the hops stick around just long enough. Medium to full soft mouthfeel, glides down. Had this one awhile back and don't recall it being this tasty. Great brew, gonna get some more.

Taste: 9.8%!? It tastes full of hoppy nectar. It is sweet, but delicately so, balanced with malt.  Feel: It is deceivingly thick with a long aftertaste.    Overall, it is a good beer.

Taste is the same, but also getting some orange and a touch of alcohol. Feel is light side of medium, but suprisingly light for the abv. Overall this beer is fantastic and a winter seasonal that I patiently wait all year for.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Bottle into a New Belgium snifter. Pours a dark, hazy gold and settles a very clear, yet dense amber in the glass. Beautiful 2 finger head of sticky, off-white foam on top. The nose is very sweet - strong notes of, get this, brown sugar along with caramel, toasted malt, and some sweet fruit (peaches maybe). The taste follows fairly precisely bringing lots of caramel and sugary sweetness to the taste buds. Again, there are notes of fruit - banana, peach - that are good, but don't mesh perfectly with the other stuff this beer has going on. Very hoppy, also, to the point where this reminds me of an old IIPA. Luckily the other flavors mingle enough to make it taste pretty good. Expectedly dense on the palate, almost syrupy. No alcohol burn at all. It's actually quite creamy and smooth.    Overall, interesting but good. This one would definitely benefit from a few months in the cellar, unless you like your strong ales and barleywines overly hoppy, which I do not. Not bad, though.

Im sure there is a boat load of malt, but I smell candy up front instead. Caramel. Some fruitiness too, maybe mangos or apricot.     Tastes nowhere near 9.8%. Hoppy, sweet. Great balance but the sweetness nudges its way up front a bit.    I wish i bought more than just a single bottle.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 On tap. Pours a hazy light brown color with a two finger head that leaves a small ring of lacing at the top of the glass. Aroma of alcohol and caramel malts, with the alcohol being the dominant smell. Taste is caramel, brown sugar, and a slight nuttiness before an acidic, boozy finish. Medium body and medium carbonation with a very boozy finish and minimal alcohol aftertaste. Kinda shocks the tongue.  The taste isn't over-run with alcohol and the alcohol is actually decently hidden until the after taste. Nice sweet body to make it very drinkable. Body is a little light, but still doesn't feel too off. Another solid one from Lagunitas.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Lagunitas Brown Sugga      Due to Lagunitas constantly putting out great beer ( for the most part ) I wanted this one for quite some time. Seeing as this is the brew Sucks replaced, I shall hold it to the same standard in terms of my ratings. Finally at long last found a sixer for $11.99 at my local shop. Drank one, and I'll review on the second one. Passed up Blackout Stout for this guy, let's hope it was worth it. Enough talk, let's crack this fucker.    Look - From the twelve ounce bottle into a pint glass. Pours a crystal clear amber with a monster moderately off white head that sticks around forever and a half leaving immediate stick as it slowly dies down to a large frothy canyon amongst the top of the drink. The carbonation appears to be very low on this brew. Lacing is extraordinarily attractive after the brew is finished and leaves a nice sticky ladder to the depthsof the promised land of hell.    Smell - The nose starts of pungent with a large smack in the face of bitter fruit juices and brown sugar. There is an ever presence of alcohol as expected for 9.8% but it is nice and fits the beer very well. Doesn't smell like a high abv stout or what have you, much cleaner without any specific alcoholic beverage to match it up to. Caramel maltyness as well.    Taste - The flavor profile starts off with a smorgasbord of that big bitter fruit juicyness I mentioned in the smell. The brown sugar and malty goodness are as prevent as you would think and the two meld perfectly and turn just a touch spicy on the tail end. Alcohol has a bit of a showing at the tail end as well though it is very tame for the beer being nearly ten fucking percent. The fruits I'm picking up are pineapple dominant with a touch of grapefruit and mango.     Feel - The feel on this one can vary considerably depending on the temperature of the beer as I've noticed. Drink this one on the warm side for full effect. Body is thin to full,again, depending on the temperature. Since the head has settles down to a thick frothy cap after half an hour the brew is very creamy. A nice spicyness in the mouth and all the flavors mentioned in the nose remain. A bit of an alcohol bite but it is so pleasant and fittingly so that you'll wanna smack your wife.    Overall - Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. This one was well worth the wait. A perfect unison of malt and hop. Too fucking easy to drink at just barely shy of 10%. Flavors come together as best they can for the abv and they are just...damn bruh. Lagunitas really did it with this beer. One of the best strong IPAs I have ever come across. Of you are a DIPA fan and you see this, buy it. All. It reminded me of the undercover shutdown ale they put out, only with better hoppyness and better balance. Truly a masterpiece. End review..

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This is a beautiful beer: deep amber in color, crystal-clear and sparkling, with a lasting giant pebbly off-white head; lacing consists of goodly, IPA-like rafts and ladders. The nose is a big, enticing blend of cotton candy, juicy pineapple and sweet/spicy florals over a more subdued grassy pine backdrop; significant boozy overtones round it out nicely. Up front, the palate is bitter pineapple and citrus with piney highlights; mid-palate the sweet/spicy characteristics emerge and bring the flavor into alignment with the aroma, and assertive boozy undertones fulfill the aroma's promise. A very nice sweetish, light-caramel malt backbone is on prominent display; this is ultimately a hop-forward beer, but the malt presence is considerable. The finish is caramel malt and pine, followed by the onset of a moderately bitter grassy pine flavor that lingers for a few minutes. Retrogustative olfaction is decidedly grassy. Mouthfeel is on point for the medium body, and the texture is creamy with a perfect slight pepperiness from the modestly-expressed fizzy carbonation. This is a very smooth drinker for the ABV, and damned tasty to boot. (12 oz bottle, no code date)

Smell: Musty citrus, fruity sweetness    Taste: Very Hop forward beer, but with enough early sweetness to successfully  prevent a runaway hop freight train. (Nice)    Feel: Full, nicely carbonated, a bit astringent.    Overall: Really becoming a fan of hoppy beers, but only those that approach the  overall experience in this same manner: (DFH 90 Minute another that does this well.)   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 appearance- Dark red/copper in color. Pours a slightly tan colored two inch head. Head recedes slowly with a good amount of lacing left behind.    aroma- Very sweet with toffee, pine, and orange candy being most notable.    taste- Lots of caramel and brown sugar sweetness at first followed by a little bit of pine hop flavor and bitterness. That orange candy sweetness definitely shows up towards he finish along with a little bit of lingering pine flavor/bitterness and caramel sweetness.     feel- Full bodied, medium carbonation, a little sticky first but surprisingly clean in the finish.    overall- Great strong ale that maintains just enough balance despite all the sweetness. Kind of reminds me of SN celebration if the malt bill was doubled. Definitely a good winter time pickup.

Smells like burnt plastic, or maybe like after you've run an old school vacuum cleaner too long and the rubber puller started to get hot. As it warms, I do get some light dried apricot but the rubbery plastic is still there. Tastes sweet with carmelized brown sugar, almost syrup or molasses like. Finished a little dry but then the carmelized brown sugar lingers into the finish. Think some of the burnt plastic character carries into the finish also. I get no hops. Feels full with a touch of some warming alcohols, but not hot. Overall, if the strange off note wasn't there I think I could dig. Otherwise, this one is a strange curiosity.

Avoids the cake-like cloying trap other sweet DIPA's tend to employ. This stands on its own. Caramel, floral and citrus. Alcohol is hidden except for the peppery/ sweet after-bite. Sips quickly for a nearly 10% abv. brew. The only downfall is that I only took out a single to buy from the six pack I found at the market. What a value.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Fun Fact: Let this one breathe a few minutes before sipping. The bouquet really opens up when you give it a chance.    This one pours with a deep, amber hue with a fizzy, thin head that dissipates quickly. Lacing is medium and sticky. Nose is a mix of piney, grapefruity hops with brown sugar/honeyed malts. Taste is sweet and citrusy up front, followed by notes of brown sugar, molasses and caramel. This is definitely a hop-forward beer, but not so much as Lagunitas' flagship beer. Mouthfeel is very sticky and resiney. Overall, this is superb, complex beer that gives you the best of both worlds - the sweetness of malt and brown sugar adjunct with the bite of an IPA.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Wow.   L - Slightly Hazy burnt amber red, 1/2 inch head quickly vanishes leaving nice lace  S - Musty fruit, grass/pine and brown sugar  T - Full bodied hops, orange, slight bitterness. Followed by an earthy sweetness  F - Great upfront heaviness, firm mouthfeel as it spreads evenly, to a crisp sweet lingering goodbye  O - One of my favorite Lagunitas beers    Perfect for late fall/winter. The closest thing to an Old Fashion experience. Heavy alcohol, fruit, bitters, leaving you ready for another.

Grapefruit, malt and hops with a softening base of light roast and toffee. As others have said, the high alcohol is almost not even noticeable. It is not the most complex beer I have had, but the blend of flavors is very well balanced and the long finish calls you for another sip.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip. Julian dating 281 5 (October 8, 2015)  Pours a nice dark amber-red-brwon with a lot of off white head. My glass is full of lacing....ridiculous!  Getting a nice hoppy aroma, not what I was expecting, although I don't really know what I was expecting...Sour lemon and pine dominating.  Taste...Clean hops taste up front with pine and a citrus bite; maltiness comes in at the end to round that out and then leaves a nice bitterness behind on the palate.  Mouth feel is...well I guess medium. Not a hint of the 9.8% abv that's listed on the label. Honestly I had no idea it had that high of an abv, either.  Overall, I never really looked into it or had plans of buying it, so when I had to complete a mix-a-six I saw this on the shelf and grabbed one. I liked it, but not enough to really go and look for it again; just satisfied with it to have had it this one time. Reminds me of Arrogant Bastard a little, just not hoppy enough. This isn't a bad beer by any means; I won't be rating low, it's like I said I won't really be seeking this one out again.

There's presence of pungent hop bitterness that compliments the malt. I wouldn't say this beer is complex but it sure is delicious.     Mouthfeel: full bodied and syrupy.

A half finger off-white head that settles rather quickly. Some lacing.    S: Cane sugar, molasses, pear, lemons and apricot.    T: Whoof! The sweetness overwhelms, but in a good way. I discovered later that this was a variant of Old Gnarlywine, which I had recently and loved. There's lots more brown sugar in this one with a depth and complexity that demands that it be sipped. Warm and inviting. Dark fruits slide in with an apricot dance. Sensual. Wraps itself around you and doesn't let go.     M: Medium to strong with medium carbonation. Thick and chewy.    O: A great fall beer with an ABV that packs a wallop. Lagunitas never fails.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Served in a small weizen glass.     L : Towering head with dense webs of lacing, caramel-honey colored body maybe 70% transparent.

T : Holy sweet and then alcohol! Super sweet beer, with notes of caramel, honey, butterscotch, and brown sugar. Behind that it's rubbing alcohol and spices. It ends slightly on oat bread, with some notes of sweet molasses.     F : Full bodied, sticky, and dense. Not creamy, but heavy. Semi-dry finish.     O : I'd have it again. Didn't know it was a 10% beer so I'm gonna cap this as I'm headed to work very soon. Nice work!

This is the Brown Shugga' Sweat Release, OG: 1.100, ABV:9.8%, IBU: 51.1     A: A very clear amber, with short head. Carbonation bubbles lingered inside the glass.     S: Floral hoppiness in the bottle. After I poured it the smell became very neutral, with a mild hop aroma lingering.     T: It’s hoppy. It’s also got the sweetness, but not malty sweetness, more like a molasses … or brown … sugar.     M: This is a full body beer. There’s a coating of the mouth that is expected from a beer made with this much sugar . A little tingly on the tongue but no burn from the high ABV.     D: I’ve drank this beer plenty of times, and until now never analyzed it. It’s a good beer which I have always enjoyed, but until now, I never realized how quiet this beer was. Heavy, but quiet. It’s a hop forward beer, and the sugar gives it more body than sweetness.

Aroma has brown sugar and malt hints, the taste follows the nose with resounding malty flavor notes. A medium bodied well balanced beer that has a nice feel but packs a powerful punch.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours beautiful copper, thick head with medium retention. Aroma is malty sweet, followed by a punch of hops. Taste is sweet brown sugar with a heavy dose of hops to even it out. Body is thick enough to contend with the alcohol, very well done. One of my favorites when it is in season!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Wow, I'm seeing ratings from June and July of this year, and this is a seasonal that gets released in mid October. To see the high marks means this seems to keep well. I have never cellared any, but that may change.    This and the Undercover Shutdown are my favs from Lagunitas, but I've yet to have a clunker from them.    Starts out with a huge malty, toffee nose, which carries thru to the arrival on the palate. Gives way to great bitter hops of grapefruit, pineapple and papaya. The only complaint I have, and it's not really a complaint, is that the bitterness of the hops lingers a bit too long on the finish.     This is dangerously quaffable at 9.9% ABV. I look forward to it every year.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Poured aggressively into a snifter. Even for an aggressive pour, this had a large head. Large foamy bubbles that retains for some time. The head reminds me of a trampled beehive with its bubbly appearance. The body has a dark amber, yet incredibly clear color. I could not detect any signs of carbonation in the appearance.    The sweetness of the brown sugar is undoubtedly present in the smell, alongside quite a bit of malt and floral notes. A stingy booze-flavor is noticeable, especially as it warms. Call me crazy, but I also felt the smell of wild berries. A welcoming smell.    The malt is the first flavor which hits the tongue, with a brown sugar/floral sweetness slowly developing in the aftertaste. The malt-flavor, in combination with the sweetness, reminded me of fresh desert bread. The combination of brown sugar and floral notes adds to a caramel type flavor. Also, I felt some black tea in the brew. The semi-bitter hops are distinct throughout the experience. Despite the bitterness of the hops, the sweetness makes the feel quite juicy. As one would expect from the appearance, carbonation is low. Even though it offers a pleasant tingling sensation to the tongue as soon as it enters one's mouth.    Not as drinkable as most Lagunitas, but then again, it is significantly stronger. I thoroughly enjoyed battling with this beer, however, at the end of the day I'm not as excited about it as I thought. I have a hard time to put my finger on it, but this beer feels like it's lesser than the sum of its parts. Still another solid brew for Lagunitas Brewing Company though.    Paid $11 for a six-pack, which is honestly a steal.

Great darkish-amber color with a decent head and good lacing down the glass. Not overly carbonated and almost syrupy in texture, it was very smooth going down. I enjoyed the distinctive IPA flavor from this ale - so I can only imagine what one of their IPAs would taste like. Although I wasn't too impressed by it's overall odor, I was very happy with the flavoring and strong, bold taste of this ale - very, very good.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Picked up a six-pack at my local Trig's grocer. The fact that I pulled it out of an unopened box on the display floor is probably a good sign that it's relatively fresh. Poured at cellar temperature into a snifter.    L: Pours a burnt sienna with about an inch-and-a-half of billowy tan head that sticks around for a good while and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Just a bit hazy, with plenty of visible carbonation.    S: Caramel malt and molasses notes are quite prominent, with added scents of raisins and dried stone fruit. Some subtle black pepper and clove in the mix, as well. Nice bouquet.    T: Sweet caramel malts at the front, accompanied by notes of molasses and rum raisin. Just a bit of a buttery quality in the middle, along with touches of the aforementioned spices, black pepper and clove. The hop flavor builds in the middle, providing a bit of tart into bitter at the sides and back of the tongue--some grassy and herbal notes. The clear alcohol starts to kick in just before the end and into the aftertaste, but it really is covered up quite well by the molasses/brown sugar sweetness of this brew.    F: Medium-bodied, creamy, and very nicely carbonated. This one has a bit of stick, but I wouldn't classify it as outright syrupy. Leaves a good bit of bitter on the palate at the close.    O: This one certainly packs a punch, and it does so with very little in the way of clear alcohol coming through. The richness of the flavors and the overall sweetness are befitting a holiday brew. Lagunitas has yet to disappoint me--this is another one I highly recommend.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Lagunitas has nailed the whole concept of brand loyalty by making all their beers taste like variations on the same theme, which I think centers around their IPA. No guesswork, no bad experiments. They all have the same dominating hop profile, so if you like one, you'll probably like them all.    Brown Shugga is the richer, maltier variety of their IPA. It pours a clear, burnt red color with some head at the top which forms some neat "crop circles" and yeast rings at the top after a few minutes. The nose has that classic bright, grapefruit hoppy flavor, but with more than a small share of burnt brown sugar, some heavy booziness like a barelywine. A bit of apricot and some nice esters come out after a time.    The taste makes the 9.9% abv quite evident, but it's still fairly relaxed. The texture has a sticky, thick quality to it, and the foam sticks around a bit, so that makes all the flavors last in your throat for quite some time. That said, there's very little bitterness considering all the hops that Lagunitas seems to like to use. I had this beer once when it came out and again now, 6 months later. Some of the fruity crispness has mellowed out and the richer flavors seem stronger now, so you can definitely say it ages in an interesting way, possibly becoming more of the beer I was expecting it to be, and less like a malty IPA as it was fresh.    Overall, one of the more unique and exciting options from one of my favorite breweries who have mastered the art of quality without prolificacy.    Edit: had a batch a year later, and it was less hoppy, more malty and strong, and closer to a barleywine than the 3xIPA it seemed more like last year. Still, opinion of it doesn't change!

Pours very easy n nice, almost a dark golden/amber not hazy look to it, with an all around head that lasts thru out also adequate lacing to boot. Smells of sugar beets, brown sugar, light hops and sweetness. Tastes almost like liquid candy. Tastes of Super sweet and a slight tartness with a bite of hops. Intoxicating yet light on your pallet, besides all the sugar lol. Ummm... alittle too sweet for me but as Lagunitas becoming one of my favourite brewer's I defintley respect what they have done here.

Taste... wow, booze and more booze. Sweet, bordering on sickeningly so. Nothing else really stands out. Would much rather have their replacement (Sucks) than this.    **Re-review a couple weeks later... Smelled and tasted great, though still a bit boozy. I think maybe my initial review was of a compromised bottle. The place where I bought the 6-pack had been out of Shugga' for several weeks at least, but lo and behold, I spied a sixer in a plain label mixed pack with Lagunitas caps, way behind the other beers. Pulled it out and discovered 6 bottles of Shugga' and was ecstatic! Well, maybe something happened to the previous bottle I reviewed, because I came back and drank two a couple weeks later and it tasted wonderful.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Reviewed 12/31/2014; purchased in December 2014.    Appearance: Pours an extremely dark amber/red with 2 fingers of frothy/foamy khaki head. Nice retention of a thin, yellowish sandy cap. Epic lacing.    Aroma: Markedly hoppy. Tropical and resinous. Really great aroma. Love this smell; tropical & malty.    Taste: Sweet arrival, tart & fruity, extremely bitter finish. I'd put this higher than 51 IBUs. Some alcohol on the finish. A little cloying at the end; slightly off-putting.    Mouthfeel: Lighter than expected; somewhat astringent; a little like Mirror Pond in that respect but not as much; relatively little carbonation and somewhat slick.    Overall: I was about to say I really like this, but the bitterness and alcohol combine at the end [as it warms] to make this just a little unpleasant. Somewhat cloying.

Clear orange to amber color with a 1" creamy head that hung around for days and left remnants of itself on the side of the glass all the way down. Sweet brown sugar and hops smell. Taste is sweet and malty but crisp and hoppy also if thats even possible. Alcohol kicks in at the end for just the right feel. I'll buy more.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 A - Poured a clear dark amber with a little chill haze, slight red hue to the color. Head was thick and frothy a mix of medium bubbles and lots of fine suds.     S - Aroma is a dark complex amalgam of sweet malt. A candied cherry fruitness. tons and tons of molasses, rum like. Burnt sugar.     T - I have had this 6 pack for a few months, upon first release it was very hoppy. Its only probably been 3 months tops? the hops have fallen off completely to let the beautiful malt shine. This is certainly unique from other barleywine style ales as it is very rum like. SO I guess its less of a malt character and more of a candy, sugar. Lots of toffee. Although the aroma hops have faded, the finish is very hoppy, not so much bitter but just a nice bite, very quenching, and balances the malt sweetness well. Without this it would be way too cloying, but that is not the case. This beer is great.     M - Mouthfeel is par for the course, thick, just enough carbonation to keep it lively. finishes sweet but the bitter hops as mentioned above quell the sweetness.     O - This beer is probably my favorite from Lagunitas. If your looking for a traditional barleywine this might be a little too sweet and rummy, but it tastes great to me, just a unique flavor. Also I try not to make a review about price and value as I feel a beer should be judged on what it is over economics... but man, 9.99 for a 6 pack of this??? In a sea of 11.99 4 packs, such a great beer for 9.99 a sixer gets me everytime.
