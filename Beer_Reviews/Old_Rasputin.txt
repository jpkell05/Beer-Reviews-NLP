look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 I've been drinking Old Rasputin for a long, long time now. I think I'm finally ready to review him.    When it comes to appearances, Old Raspy is second to none. Obsidian black, reflective, clean, and gorgeous. The brightest light in the world won't be seen through the other side. Chestnut highlights can be seen, but only down the barrel of the glass as sips are indulged upon. And resting above, a memory foam pillow of tan, frothy, silky, root beer float like suds. After what seems like an eternity, it starts to settle leaving a layer frosted above the surface and a blanket of lacing on every square inch it touches.    Next, that unmistakable aroma. Charred toast and spent roasted grain. Ashes left over from last nights embers. A hint of salinity reminiscent of black olives. Mineral water heavy with alkalinity. Earth, with all its raw dirt and herbal goodness saturates the nostrils.    And then, what we have all been waiting for. The burst of flavors that come from what seems like a harmless aroma is overwhelming at first. The amount of roast is unequalled. Once the shudder down my spine and the goosebumps have faded, another sip is in order. The charred toast is slathered in molasses then brûléed giving off a note of burnt chocolate. The mineral water quality comes next, like it was freshly drawn from the river and boiled in a copper kettle. Airborne particles from freshly swept dusty floors get in there blending with a hint of vanilla and nuts making for a one of a kind sweet and earthy finish. It tastes old. As in "Old World".    Old Rasputin has a well made slough of textures. Smooth yet not creamy with a barrel like stripping dryness on the end, but without the barrel. The quick initial molasses sweetness is quickly overcome by roasted and bitter bakers chocolate. The alcohol is almost completely undetected, dangerously so. He ends with a lip smacking glue and a musty bitter bite.    Old Rasputin has stood against the test of time. Rightfully so as this beer has it all. Classic flavors, quality craftsmanship, incomparable availability, steal of a pricetag, reputation both impressive and frightening. An icon that would please any Czar, and one that has and will continue to frequent my fridge. Breweries and their stouts come and go, but He won't die.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Old Rasputin brewed by North Coast Brewing Co. ,with an ABV of 9.00% This Russian Imperial Stout pours out of a 12oz glass bottle into a pint beer an deep brown color with an a nice light brown head. This brew has the look of black coffee, not saying that is a bad thing. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with roasted goodness. You pick up on a lot of roasted grains and malts. Then a nice mix of hop bitterness at the end to tie it all together. So far Old Rasputin is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold an Rich with flavors. You first pick on all the roasted goodness. Lots of nice smooth roasted malts and grains. The body of Old Rasputin is a medium to heavy. Not to heavy but definitely a lot heavier than other Stouts on the market. It is hard to pick up on the 9.00% ABV in this brew, it goes down just that smooth. This brew would go nice with dinner or on a cold winter day. The mouth feel is Rich, Bold, Roasted, Clean, Smooth, and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Old Rasputin a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. North Coast Brewing Co., did a super nice job with this Russian Imperial Stout.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This beer has been around for years and years, if it’s on a restaurant menu and you love stouts you’re probably going to order this. It’s everytning you want in a stout.   Deep dark licorice in color, strong smell of coffee and molasses, a rich full flavor with the bite of a stout.   It’s a really good stout, but you probably already knew that.

Smell - A bitter smell almost similar to a cold brew coffee  Taste - Bitterness is strong with a subtle coffee/chocolate background. The alcohol is pronounced and stands out at 9%.  Feel - A good amount of carbonation and heavy mouthfeel allowing it to go down particularly smooth for the strong bitterness and ABV.    Overall - I'm new to the style and it's not particularly my style, but seems like a strong representation of an imperial stout at an affordable price. When I want a Russian imperial stout on a cold winter's night, this is the one I grab.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 This beauty pours a licorice black body with a slim tan head that dissipates into a thin skim.  The nose is all about strong coffee, roasted grains, burnt sugar cookies and molasses.   The flavor mirrors the aroma along with some dark toasted pumpernickel.   The mouthfeel is medium light with just a slight carbonated sizzle on the tail-end.   Overall this is an intense and satisfying stout that stands out of the crowded field and clubbers your taste buds into submission with every pull.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Good dark color, but a smaller head for a stout. Smells toasty toasted malts, chocolate and coffee. Taste smooth and flavorful for a stout. Bitter. Pretty standard for a stout. Hides the 9% well. Not quite as creamy as I would expect. Overall a solid stout but not my favorite.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Tasting a bottle from a 4 pack...This beer is inky black in my pint glass with a roasted/chocolaty flavor. Some bitterness in the taste profile but not overwhelming. Slight head with good lacing on the glass. Someone else who rated it said it was their benchmark stout and I can see why. This is my first time tasting it and it's great, I'll be back.

Normally, I dont like imperial russian stouts -finding them too heavy (feel & taste) and bitter, but this is a work of art.    Looks.. Well my phone flashlight is just a tiny brown dot through the pint glass.  Smells very chocolately and roasty  Tastes.. Very chocolately and roasty - big malts that give it a robust flavor with very present but very well balanced bitterness.  Feels very very wide and smooth, but with balance.. it doesnt weight you down but rather takes its time.   The 9+% abv is well hidden and takes its time as well - definitely not a session beer!!    Overall, it's bold yet balanced, powerful yet measured, deep yet drinkable. As I said, the hype is real.

I stumbled on this one by happen chance. It was full bodied, robust, nice head and had no undesirable aftertaste. It is now my go-to brew.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Was stunned to realize I hadn't reviewed this one, having had it several times before in my life.    Very dark brown, pours decent sized tan head, creamy and lingering.    Chocolate, raisin, coffee aromas dominate for me initially. A rich, sweet roasty aroma.    Quite malty sweet up front, with some of the chocolate and dark fruit noted in the aroma. Roast and bitterness is present early, but stays somewhat muted compared to some imperial stouts. Finishes with the roast taking over, but the malt sweetness never completely ceases. A delicious stout without being overpoweringly stouty.     Full body and moderate carbonation. No astringency, and a mellow warming. Might prefer a lower carbonation level.     Always a favorite imperial stout of mine due to its drinkability. Some RIS examples are over the top in terms of alcohol and roast. This one is not.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A: Pours a tan one finger head. Completely opaque, almost solidly black except the edges which are a dark dark brown. Beautiful lacing, but dissipates too soon.    S: Chocolate, coffee, heavy roast, alcohol, dark fruit, raisins, malt    T: Wow this is an intense brew. The roasted bitterness hits you immediately, tempered by the mellow creaminess of the chocolate. Ends with a good burnt breadiness.    O: I used the word bitter many times in the review, because this beer highlights how to use bitterness to create depth and flavor without overpowering everything else. This is an intense but smooth brew. Big on flavor, easy to drink. One heck of a stout.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Possible date stamp on label is '81330709'. This is a 2018 produced beer.  Black colored body, with some dark brown and ruby brown edges when back lit. Aggressive pour brought forth a one finger, puffy, khaki colored head. Each sip leaves behind a few scattered spots of lacing.  Well balanced aroma of dark roasted malts with char, coffee, and chocolate. Out of the char is a whiff of dark dried fruits.  Taste is dark roasted malts that express deep dark chocolate, burnt coffee, and a hint of soaked, dart dried fruit.  Quite the smooth and creamy mouth feel. Very enjoyable. Okay carbonation. Not overly bitter.  Tremendous balance of the flavors lead to a very pleasant drinking experience. Very easy to take repeated sips in short order. Bitterness is kept very low and the char stays at the end, but the slight sweetness of the malts balance this out. There is a companion component of brighter hops that add well to the mix and balance.

Taste- Lots of malt up front, turning more chocolate as the flavor goes on. Lots of coffee notes into a bitter finish which is quite smoky as well.    Mouthfeel- Heavy in body, medium carbonation.

Taste  Taste is the same as smell, and very well balanced—just the right flavor and finish.    Mouthfeel  Heavy, soft, velvety smooth body, with a nice carbonation.    =====  With the exception a Deschutes Abyss I once had on tap, THIS is the Russian Imperial Stout I go back to time and again—and the one I measure all others by. It’s a full-bodied and filling sipper for the right occasion.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Classic American example of the RIS style.  Complex roasted malt character, black char and chocolate and earthy bitterness.

Believe it or not the first thing that I am smelling is some hops. I hope this is not a bad thing. the bourbon barrel aged version smells better. I also agree with this one particular beer reviewer stating that Old Rasputin tastes similar to a dark chocolate covered black cherry. Moreover, Old Rasputin has one of the best label design artwork that I have noticed. I did not notice a date on the bottle I had thought that North Coast Brewing Co. did put dates on their products, oh well a non adjunct RIS should not go bad too soon so, I won't take off points for that this time around. I am detecting some hop presence, but it's nothing inadmissible. This is a great laid back west coast style approach to a RIS style. I appreciate the adjuncts like coffee or chocolate, but sometimes I want to drink 2 or 3 bottles of a RIS that is not going to make me feel edgy & irritated. I can see why this is considered a benchmark in the earlier American craft beer days, with this beer sort of having a style of its own. I agree this is an overstated RIS, matter of fact this taste more like a black IPA. I'm very disappointed with the Old Rasputin. North Coast needs to work on revising this recipe big time. Furthermore, I would like to try this on tap sometime. Cheers! B

Then I was introduced to Old Rasputin and the crazy notion that a stout from California surpassed my longtime favorite. Some 20 years later this beer is relevant because its attributes, a semi dry english style stout distinguished by the right amount of carbonation makes it that every day after work stout, like a Guinness, albeit with an abv at 9%. The score reflects the incredibly cheap 4 pack price of around 10 bucks!

It’s just a shade below absolute, opaque black, with a nice creamed coffee head. Aroma is malty sweet and cocoa dry. The taste brings it all back home, weaving a genuinely classic stout from strands of bitter chocolate, dark, dark espresso, a hint of mineral ash, raisins and fresh cookies. Excellent feel that allows the long finish to linger appropriately. I’ve been enjoying this beer for years; it’s dependably excellent. It ages very well and it’s really great on tap too.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 North Coast Old Rasputin RIS - 9% ABV - 75 IBUs  Date: 06/21/18, enjoyed on 09/03/18.  Appearance: Black, not used motor oil black but a standard stout color with two fingers of mocha colored head. There is some slight ruby red color seeping in around the edges.  Aroma: Big roasted malt aromas, slight char, and bitter dark chocolate. It actually smells a little sweet, like cacao powder.   Taste: As with the nose, the boldest flavor are these big malty notes followed by a slightly sweet and more milky chocolate taste. There is a beautiful ashy, almost charred quality to the malts that really works wonderfully. The finish on Old Rasputin is quite bitter, letting those IBUs really shine. It has a full mouthfeel with an almost velvet texture. Some dark roast coffee notes come out as the beer reaches room temperature.   Biased comments: Wow, this is still one impressive beer and perhaps my favorite stout. After the explosion in popularity of adjunct filled beers and pastry stouts, it is very refreshing to return to a beer that is the antithesis of all that. Also, North Coast must be one of the most underrated breweries on the planet. All of their beers that I’ve had are quality beers, and that isn’t something I can say for very many breweries. This beer in particular is a good deal better than many of the whales I have managed to chase down and is available nearly everywhere for less than $10, and its Non-GMO as well!

This beer is not for everyone. It is extremely bitter. I can't seem to understand why some people seem to think more flavor=better. While this beer is worth trying at least once it's not something you would want to drink often. Most of these stronger flavored beers are overrated due to beer-snobs. The rating of this beer is higher than it should be. CHEERS!

Medium roast coffee bean & hop bite flavors up front; fresh earth notes on the finish.     Too hop forward for me to really love; this is practically a Cascadian dark ale.

I picked a bottle up with a mixed six pack and put it in the fridge, had a Guinness to compare it to, well when time came.     I took one sip and this literally made me vomit. I don't think I've ever drank something more vile in my life. The other reviews made this sound awesome and I'm sure it is for people who exclusively drink Stouts, but if that's not what you normally drink, leave this alone.    Sincerely, a guy who loved Stouts who is now put off by them because of this.

look: 2.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 1 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2 It's very bitter from start to end. I think it has the expected coffee, toffee, chocolate etc. tastes of stout but it's dwarfed by the intense bitter taste.     Not sure why others like it. I guess they don't focus on the bitterness as much. But I think IPAs are more hop and bitter oriented than stouts - so this wasn't expected. I thought the toasted barely malts should dominate rather than bitter hops.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Aggressive pour into a Duvel tulip glass. 2.5 fingers of creamy mocha head that lingered for a few minutes then dissipated. Typical stout black color. Nose is chocolate, alcohol, very faint coffee, and slight toffee. Taste follows the smell and alcohol is pretty strong making this beer seem stronger than it is (is this 9% or 12%?). Slight burn in the aftertaste which gives way to faint hints of chocolate and an even fainter taste of fruit. Mouthfeel is surprisingly not sticky. I am fairly new to this style but this is one I would have again, although in moderation.

I will give this one another try down the road because I see it has some wonderful reviews. The look was amazing the smell was fantastic but just to much depth I think for my taste at this time.

This stout will wreck you. It’ll leave you disappointed...with 90% of every other stout you drink. Pours dark and void of any light. Smells like deep, dark coffee and chocolate. If it sounds like I’m in love with this beer, then your reading it correctly. Albeit it’s darker then Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction, it drinks remarkably smooth and refreshing! I would definitely recommend this to not only to friends but foes alike. Cheers!

However, there's also hints of coffee and a mild hop finish to round it all out.    Feel - Thick body with medium carbonation. Heavy and refreshing to drink.    Overall - This was one of the first beers I ever drank. Had it at a hot 4th of July party, and absolutely hated it. Coming back to it now, and I love it. A wonderfully enjoyable stout.

Intense, earthy, dark roasted malt, sweet dark malts, dark fruit and dark chocolate aromas with an underlying booziness. Medium bodied with medium light carbonation. Smooth, slightly oily, creamy feel through the middle followed by pleasant boozy warmth to the finish. Sweet dark malt flavors up front that slowly transition to intense roasted maltiness. Medium bitterness through the middle followed by bitter , charred malt overtop emerging boozy warmth. Finished semi-dryly with grainy, dark malt flavors followed by dark roasted maltiness that transition to mellow, burnt malt notes. An intensely malty experience that is best sampled on the warmer side. Very tasty with fabulous malt complexity.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Looks very dark poured into a shifter. Some dark brown foam head that quickly dissipated into minimal lacing.     Smells heavy with alcohol, chocolate, and toast at the front.    Tastes after the nose with caramel and toast at the back.     Mouthfeel is smooth with a bit of carbonation, nearly perfect with Russian food.    Overall great, a personal favorite with Russian tea cakes.    Pairs well with strong cheese, Russian tea cakes, and chocolate mousse.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Bottle dated 10/03/2017. CBF Tulip.    A: pours an opaque black with a finger and a half of gorgeous frothy, sandy head. Rings of lacing down the glass.    S: deep, sweet, complex aromatic roast. Surprisingly jammy, fruity, herbal, hoppy. A lot like Narwhal in that respect - perhaps more so for the perceived berry-like aspect here.     T: wow. Intense hoppy, toasty, sweet maltiness. Characterized by a tart, berry-like sweet hoppiness and a lingering roasty bitterness.     M: full-bodied, slick, with virtually no carbonation.    O: I had this a decade ago as a taster at a winter farmers market and was blown away. I have been looking for it since, and I can see why. Truly superb. I honestly think I like this better than Narwhal or Blackout.

If you're picking up this brew, then I think he is and has been. This is good, throaty stuff for true believers. If you're a casual, then retreat to your Bud Light. If you're ready for a hoppy martyrdom, then jump in.

look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 The smell is surprising for a stout! Pours with hardly any head, creamy light brown colour. When inhaled deeply can smell the alchohol, but there is actually an overpowering fruity citrus to the scent which I find very surprising. a slight bit of roastyness there, and a good amount of fresh smelling hops bitterness. Smells more of a black IPA than a stout.    Tastes like a black IPA as well, which I love! A huge a roasty caramel flavour on the start, with slight malt flavour finishing in intense hoppy, dry bitterness. Tastes way better than it looks in my opinion! I would go ahead and call it a black double IPA personally! Really find it tastes and feels more like a roasty IPA than a stout! Very bitter and floral hops tastes for a stout.    Bottom line: This is surprisingly really good in a way I didn't expect at all, I'm glad I got a whole growler!!!

In the words of my Bro, it tastes like leather and man.     Look: super dark. Barely a ruby glimmer can be seen at the edge of the glass when held to the light. A sticky brown froth-like head that sticks everywhere.   Smell: hops, dark roasted malts, an acidic char, cocoa powder, Turkish coffee.   Taste: follows the nose. Dark charred malts, an acidic high note, grass, hay, and leather. Espresso. Some sweet notes.   Feel: full body, low to moderate carbonation, a little chewy.

GLASSWARE: Corsendonk stemmed tulip... builds a three-finger brown slushy head that forms a mesa at its center... the pile of brown head sits atop the crypt-like blackness... thick cocoa intensity early, with a soft lactic enticement... roasted malts mesh with oats, coffee bean, and earthy vegetable... first sip is potent, thick, warming, lasting, resounding with a molasses-like consistency... slightly boozy, but not alcoholic.... strong, dry, and commanding... sweet, almost puckering at 9%, textured enough to leave a tobacco-like herbal finish... after passing this by in stores for years, I am happy to have made its intimate acquaintance... the smears of lacing articulate a quality product, with heavy clouds around the glass... huge payoff, and one that drinks like a scotch...   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a pitch black coloration with a medium creamy head. Smells of roasted coffee, caramel and a hint of dark fruits. Taste follows the nose with a rich roasted coffee taste and notes of sweet caramel malts, dark fruits and chocolate, with a nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is nice, but could honestly be better, which is my main complain here. Does not top Narwhal for me, which has a better mouthfeel and is more chocolate-forward, with a milder bitterness.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottled 5/8/17 poured into a tulip pint glass at fridge temp 9% ABV. The beer pours dense black with mocha brown head. The head recedes to a ring and patchy islands leaving lacing from the top of the glass to the bottom. The aroma is roast malt, coffee and a hint of dark fruit. The taste is semisweet dark fruit at first that transitions to big roasty bitterness on the end. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, adequately carbonated, smooth and dry. Overall, excellent. This is a standard bearer for the style.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Poured into a perfect pint glass.    Appearance - two fingers of thick, creamy, tan head. Very dark, almost black, with a very deep ruby hint when held up to light. Nearly opaque. Lacing sticks to the side of the glass in a uniform wall.    Smell - the aroma is almost sweet, with notes of darker fruit, dates, currant, and raisin. A little smokey. Black coffee and toffee.    Taste - malt is very forward with a taste of dark chocolate cocoa, leading to a lingering aftertaste of burnt popcorn kernel. Moderate bitterness.     Mouth feel - high carbonation, with a medium to full body. Smooth finish. More viscous than your average beer, but not as full bodied as I would have expected.    Overall - I'm not typically a stout kind of girl, so maybe this one is going to be victim of the style. Don't get me wrong, this is a really solid stout - you won't be disappointed. But there's nothing about it that "wows" me. At 9.00% abv this packs a good punch, and it is especially drinkable for such a dark beer.

My first impression is that it tastes almost like a barrel aged stout. After enjoying some fresh Narwhal (which I truly enjoy) I have to say that this is a step above and worth paying a little more for. It is very well balanced and really shines for me on the finish. The front end is as it should be and the back end has a great combination of a slight sweetness mixed with a very enjoyable booziness. I only purchase it once or twice a year but when I do I am happy that I did.

Smells foremost of licorice (not particularly my favorite) followed by dark fruity notes and a touch of roast.    The taste is so satisfying. Roast is much more prevalent and softened by sweet malts and dextrins. Many subtleties from unsweetened cacao, to chicory and on to dates/raisins. Some floral notes too. Definite hop presence and roast balance out the sweetness and allow this beer a beautiful balance.    Mouthfeel is full, but not overwhelming.    Overall this beer is a standard for a reason. Totally approachable and totally drinkable despite its 9% ABV. Would have no problem drinking a 4 pack in a night... other than knowing how unproductive my tomorrow would be.

The pour produces a huge, lasting, tight, cottony, mocha head which leaves thin, sticky lacing. Aroma is cocoa, coffee, dark bread, roast and earthy hops. Taste is semi-sweet dark chocolate, toffee, roasted/burnt malt, dates, figs and fruit cake with coffee in the finish where it blends with hop bitterness and peppery spice. Heavy bodied, complex and incredibly good!

Imagine putting into a blender- deep dark chocolate, dates, raisins, prunes, a touch of cream, and the richest of coffees and toffee. Then store it all in a cask of charred oak until it becomes something mortal man does not deserve!     That is the best that I can do. Perfection in a glass!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 A- Pours with a very thick consistency, like motor oil and is super brown/black in color.....completely opaque as well! The head is super creamy, has excellent retention, eventually settling down to a thick layer over the brew (starts out about one finger thick), and is very dense like a meringue top. Obviously the carbonation is much too tough to see and there is a super sticky and thick lacing that sticks to the side of the glass. Very nice looking overall!    S- Loads of deep dark chocolate, black coffee, creamy almond like liqueur, burnt black/chocolate malts, hints of licorice, rye bread and yeast, along with slight rummy vanilla/caramel sweetness near the finish. It doesn't have the traditional Imperial Russian stout booziness as its well hidden in the aroma overall!    T- This is quite a nice Imperial! The booziness hits the palate immediately and then quickly settles down, only after hitting the top of the palate with hopped bitterness! Again, there is a great deal of cocoa powder, french press black coffee astringency, 90%+ chocolate, creamy yeast, burnt brown sugars, licorice Earthiness, blackstrap molassess, perhaps of nuttiness, charred vanilla creme, and a hopped bitterness that lingers on the palate long after the taste.     M/O- Rich and full bodied, with smooth velvety carbonation! The problem, and this really isn't a problem, is how easy drinking this is and I'd be afraid of enjoying one too many before it creeps up on me.....right in the Rasputin! The booze is superbly well hidden throughout once your palate accustoms to the initial taste. Love the heavy coffee/chocolate/cocoa character and most definitely recommend this one to any Stout lovers! Will be getting again!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 355ml bottle poured into a snifter.    Crude black in color with very thick silky dark brown head, the head withstands with good retention before slowly subsiding to an eternal foamy crown that won’t die down and leaving lots of lacing patch and spot.    Very rich chocolate that tends to be dark rather than milky along with cocoa nibs, black coffee with slight sourness, and roasted take the lead. Then I get fudge, dark bread, cocoa powder, burnt caramel, sweet dark fruits, mint, and licorice. Lightly charred nut too and a little bit smoked but not in kind of meaty also with some significant touch of leafty and grassy hop.    It is heavily roasted through the palate sensation together with notes of dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, cocoa powder, black coffee with slight sourness, fudge, dark bread, burnt caramel, sweet dark fruits, mint, licorice, charred nut, slightly smoked, all mostly from malt. Hop is there so upright with its leafty, herbal, and persistent grassy bitterness that comes from both hop and roasted malt.    Rather full body with smooth and just slight viscous mouthfeel but somehow a bit watery, the carbonation is low while the feeling is well-rounded and good to carry the complexity and intensity of all the characters. Finish is very dry and pleasant.    Great RIS and perfect example to the style, it is rich, deep, and complex. Apart from its typical deep yet intense roasted, coffee, and chocolate, you will also get so bold hop characters of grass, herbal, and big bitter kick.

The head has a creamy feel on the tongue, and the body is pleasantly smooth and milky. This is likely one of the best-feeling beers I've ever had. That said, I couldn't get around to liking the taste, which is chocolaty but also somewhat sour and stale. It smells strongly of chocolate as well, though a little flatter than most beers of its kind that I've tried. This has the formula to be a favorite beer of mine, but it ended up disappointing me.

Appears nearly jet black and opaque with a one and a half finger creamy tan head. Some ruby highlights. Nice sticky lacing.     Smells of roasted coffee, bakers chocolate and dark roasted malts. Touch of alcohol. Ripe dark fruits. Hints of tobacco barn and smoke.    Taste follows the nose with a balanced blend of sweetish chocolate, expresso coffee and roasted malts. Deep luscious dark fruit like plum, raisins and dates. The bitter is in there but almost completely lost in the in the mix. Silky on the palate with perfect carbonation. Sweet up front then boozy with a good hop finish added to the dark roasted malts. Silky on the palate with perfect carbonation.     Overall this has to be one of the top imperial stouts. I enjoyed it immensely. Cheers!!

Smells thick of rich malt and lightly of malt. Taste is slightly bitter and sweet with a delicious mix of coffee flavor and hops playing well together. The feel is rich and smooth on the tongue. Body is fairly heavy, but not overwhelmingly so. This beer has a near completely perfect mix of everything from the smell, taste, and body which makes for a fantastic beer that thoroughly pleases.

The beer gets sweeter as it goes. There is an ever so slight caramel in the taste as well. The palate is medium to thick bodied. Overall, this beer never ceases to amaze me no matter how many times I have it.

Please, PLEASE if the brewers are reading this, you need to dial the hops back at least 50% from where they are now. There is nothing more disappointing than having a great midnight beach hang with the pooper, place the snifter out, pour what looks to be a fantastic beer with great head & lacing, only to smell hops right off the bat.    Then the taste, come on man. Please. Someone please stop with the hops already. An Imperial Stout should be bready, malty, with some dark cherry, plums, raisins maybe, with subtle licorice and coffee overtones, but never, EVER hoppy!     Thank God I brought a variety down to the beach with me. If have been pissed to have to walk back and get more beer.

look: 5 | smell: 2 | taste: 2 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 2 I read several of the reviews on this beer. Ive had other imperial stouts and was excited to try this one. I couldn't be more disappointed. The feel and look are fine for an Imperial Ale, but my overall score is based on the taste, which is the most important factor. It's way over-hopped so it drowns out any subtle flavors from the malts. Stouts, in my opinion should be malty to balanced, with the bitterness coming from the roasting of the malts rather than an over abundance of hops. It's as if they're trying to turn it into the dark version of an IPA, an IDA? IPAs are fine if that's what you go for, but when I drink stout ale I want to enjoy balanced malty goodness, not Christmas tree flavored brew. This is just a terrible ale. Brewers shouldn't feel they need to add a ridiculous amount of hops just because the alcohol content is high. This ale would probably be pretty tasty if they dialed the hops back a bit. I didn't give it a 1 because I would reserve that for Coors and Budweiser.

Not the first time I've enjoyed this stout, though it is the first time I've had a chance to review it.    Pours black as night, with roughly one inch of frothy, tan-coloured foam seated atop. Ungodly retention; the head gives up virtually no ground for more than 15 minutes, though it does take on a smoother, creamier, lumpier appearance - as its big, soapy bubbles burst, gradually being replaced from below by tiny, finer gauge bubbles. Beautiful lacing, too; this is a visually-stunning brew. The aroma reveals this to be a rather well-hopped stout, with big leafy, earthy hop notes coming through almost as clearly as the rich, roasted malts themselves. Black coffee, molasses, dark chocolate and cocoa figure in strongly, with accents of licorice, dates, raisin, alcohol and smoke supplying added depth of character to the nose.    A genuine treat to sip. Big roasted malt flavours dominate the profile right off the bat - espresso coffee and baker's chocolate blend together with a mix of caramelized sugar and molasses sweetness. Hints of date, prune and vanilla also come through by the midpoint, with the sip rounded out by herbal licorice, earthy pine resin and leafy hop bitterness on the back end. Finishes bitter, with coffee grounds and earthy hop flavours fading as you approach the dry-ish aftertaste. Medium-full in body, with restrained carbonation that gently prickles the palate and provides a slight bite; the overall texture is quite smooth, luscious and creamy. Pleasurable and fulfilling to sip.    Final Grade: 4.35, an A grade. Old Rasputin is exactly what an imperial Russian stout should be - rich, smooth, balanced, and intense. When I first tried this imperial stout a few years back, I definitely liked it, but not to the extent where I considered it one of the best - however, this follow-up sampling has converted me into a true believer. The exquisite balance achieved between the roasted malts and sturdy hop notes is nothing less than a thing of beauty. There may very well be better stouts out there, but that doesn't diminish what North Coast has managed to accomplish. One of the grand-daddies of them all; if you haven't tried Old Rasputin, do yourself a favour and take whatever steps are necessary to correct that.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 It's a heavy handed beer that knocks you out with a strong nose of raspberry and molasses, approaching a wine bouquet.

Soon enough, taste diffuses into rich body of aforementioned java.    Incredibly smooth.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I am baffled as to how it has taken me until now to review this beer. I wish that it were as easy as blaming it on The Bottle Backlog here at Chez Woody, but this was a fairly fresh bottle that I recently scored simply to drink & review. I am scratching my head in response.     From the bottle: "Brewed in the tradition of the 18th century English brewers who supplied the Russian court of Catherine the Great."; "Old Rasputin develops a cult following wherever it goes. It's a rich, intense brew with big, complex flavors & a warming finish."    Still shaking my head, I Pop!ped the cap & began a slow, gentle pour. Once sufficiently decanted, a vigorous in-glass swirl raised three-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-brown head with good retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing deep brown highlights to be visible only at the edges. Nose was smoky, with notes of coffee and especially dark chocolate brownies. To be even more precise, this smelled like liquefied chocolate brownies! Wow. No wonder this is so popular. I was impressed & I hadn't even taken my first sip of this review! Mouthfeel was big, thick & creamy, a dollop on my tongue. I just let it lie there & roll around. The dark, rich chocolaty taste was like a liquefied dessert, whether brownies, chocolate mousse, chocolate ice cream, ad chocofinitum. Wow! Finish was semi-sweet since the chocolate also had a bitter edge to it. It was just a bit much for me and left me craving something that was hop-driven. An RIS just is not my bag.

Head is a nice smooth frothy brown and sticks around. Aroma is an intoxicating mix of roasted coffee and bittersweet cocoa with burnt caramel and some booze. Taste is all of the above in a fairly dry package with a bit of booziness high in the back of the palate and some bitter hops lower in the back and in the finish, without much linger. Great balance. Feel is not quite as creamy as I would like for the style, but still medium to full bodied, with moderate not-too-low carbonation which I do like.  It seems to get better every time I drink it. Why does a Russian or American imperial stout have to have 14% or higher alcohol to crack the BA250? I don't get it.

Has a smell of dryness and brown sugar and caramel. Moderate carbonation with decent creaminess. Carbonation weakens as it is consumed. Nice toasty malty flavor with hints of brown sugar and caramel. Moderate hop profile that has a dry finish. A very good stout, but the creaminess seemed a little thin to me.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 The label is exceptionally attractive. Pitch black pour, light colored micro foam decorated with pearls of macro bubbles. Smell is warm and ancient, yet slight, may be due to a stuffy nose. Taste is tip-of-the-tongue godly, definitely in my top 5. The mouthfeel is creamy yet refreshingly carbonated. This beer changes rapidly with exposure, new hints and undertones with separated sips, though I suggest you finish it quite quickly, as to not lose it's integrity. Great Buzz. Fantastic Beer.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Old Rapustin has been a long sought after beer for me, jokingly using the "Rasputin" name in regular conversation referencing beer purchases with my girlfriend.    This beer is black with a light light tan head (quite big) with micro bubbles in tan spraying all over as lacing.     The smell is of roasted malts, maybe some roasted chocolate, and also a bit of oats. This smell brings home the taste, a mash of roasted malts and many darker flavors while maintaining a minor hop bitterness that does not linger. Goes down easy and maintains a surprisingly light mouth feel.    I really enjoy this beer but I don't think it is something I haven't had before. It feels reallly good, by the time you are finishing number 2 (I drink fast). I think it deserves a good rating but it isn't absolutely blowing my mind. That being said it is really good, that can't be denied. I will likely buy again sometime, but it's no immediate concern. It did cost over $10 for a 4 pack. Maybe if it came in a 6, I'd feel a little more convinced. Good beer!

Great lacing all down the glass.    Smells strongly of stone fruits and toasted malts. A bit of an earthy aroma here as well, could this be some hoppiness?    Taste is toasted malts with some bitter from hops and a slight alcohol warming in the back of the mouth.    The mouth is the lighter side of medium with a bit of a lingering bitter finish.    Overall this is a very nicely done Russian Imperial Stout. For fans of the bigger and heavier stouts this is a must buy and try. My hat is off to the North Coast brewers for providing me and my wife with such a tasty beverage.

Taste like a stout should be...not as smooth as some others but still a good after work beer. Goes down easy but 1 is enough. Overall good but not good enough to buy again... too many other beers to try.

Produced a nice tall light brown head that lasted several minutes after pouring. The color is of the same opaqueness as black coffee. Smells light roasted malts as many others have said. The taste is just great. One of the best imperial stouts I have tried. Some imperial stouts have me a bit of a bite and unwelcome aftertaste (Lagunitas Imperial Stout) but this Old Rasputin goes done very smoothly. Gives a pleasant, somewhat sweet aftertaste.     I can absolutely recommend this beverage, even for those who are not dark beer fans.

Goes especially well with the rain, but I plan on savoring Old Rasputin year round, until the end of Time ...  Poured into a big mouth wine glass, enjoyed with a chocolate muffin.    Black with a few nice bubble streams, bubbly tan head, nice lacing too.    Smells slightly malty, with a bit of toasty bread, chocolate and coffee.    A complex taste, roasty-refined. Similar to the smell, subtle and delicious.     Truly Imperial: high quality, easily available and low cost, with a well deserved majestic reputation!

The taste is roasty, with rich chocolate notes. Pinesol and lemony hops provide great balance. Tobacco and leather notes in the background. The mouthfeel is medium full with a light carbonation. Moderate bitterness and dark chocolate and roasted barley in the long finish.    A very nice RIS, very much to style with plenty of complexity and balance. Any dark beer fan should seek it out.

I don't like stouts, unless they offer something extra (Dragon's Milk, Peche Mortel), so any rating from me on a straight forward stout is unfair. But I still try everything I can, and of course I had to try this one.   Not bad, a little more tolerable than most, but I still don't get why all of dark chocolate's goodness disappears in beer. I like dark chocolate a lot. In fact, that is the only chocolate I like. But in beer, it becomes obtrusive and bitter in a bad way (unlike the bitter goodness of a double IPA).   The rest is obligatory: beautiful thick head with some retention and gentle lacing, bitter (blah! to me) nose and a taste that will leave stout lovers satisfied, although it may be surprisingly watery to some. Buy it with confidence.

Nutty, lightly-roasted malts, chocolate and a little coffee stand out in the aroma. These continue to the taste where they mix with a stronger, more charred-malt flavor, some pretty strong hop bitterness, a slight vegetal flavor and a kiss of alcohol on the backend.     It's medium-to-heavy bodied with strong carbonation in play in the mouthfeel.     To me, this is a beer that would have seemed world class fifteen years ago. The vegetal note and the not-quite-perfect carbonation level knock it a bit in my scoring, but I really appreciate the charred, bitter qualities in this one and can definitely see why it's beloved.     Packaged on 12142016.

If it has a downside it can be a bit harsh at times, definitely a sipper. But that's not really a bad thing given how strong this stuff is! Highly recommended, and I love how readily available it is. there are better Imperial Stouts out there, but few so consistently available. Especially outside of Rare Beer Festivals.

Beautifully dark, thick head, and good lacing make for a visually appealing beer. The smell was distinctive to most other Russian imperials but with a good scent of booziness to tingle the nose. The mouthfeel was somewhere between medium and full-bodied but with carbonation that did not necessarily distract from the overall experience. The taste was not my best of Russian imperials I have had, but I'm pretty sure it's up there. Overall, it's an impressive beer that is well worth the hype found within this hallowed site.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Appearance: One of the best looking stouts I have ever seen. A pitch black beer that pours a huge, three finger khaki colored head that laces the glass exceptionally well. Head retention is superb, and lasts for a good 10 minutes before finally settling down.    Aroma: Lots of dark chocolate and roasted malt with hints of coffee and sweet vanilla. A tiny hint of piney hops and notions of fine tobacco. A little bit of alcohol on the nose as well. A great smelling stout.    Taste: Extremely pleasant. The flavor is predominantly consistent of a creamy, dry, dark roasted malt flavor. I'm getting bittersweet gourmet dark chocolate, rich connecticut tobacco, old leather, hints of vanilla beans, coffee and very very faint notions of sugar cookies. As it warms resinous, piney sensations from the hops assert themselves.    Feel: Full bodied with low carbonation. Smooth and velvety. Crisp (for an RIS).    Overall: Probably my favorite russian imperial of all time. Very hearty and complex, with deep notes of bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt. The mouthfeel and taste are really perfect for the style. The flavor is intricate, robust and creamy without the mouthfeel being too unctuous or slimy. Just dry enough so as to not leave you reaching for a glass of water, and crisp enough to enjoy during the warmer months without being too watery and thin.    This beer isn't for everyone but if you have a palate for dark chocolate and imperial stouts this is one you'll really enjoy.

Taste: Complex malt body with layers of roasted and burnt grains, espresso and some bittersweet chocolate in the close. A healthy dose of earthy, bitter, herbal hops keeps any sweetness in check.    Mouthfeel: Full bodied and smooth with just enough carbonation.    Overall: Big, bold and complex; definitely lives up to its reputation as a classic RIS.

The head has impressive body, and real staying power, lingering long after most Stouts would have given up. Lacing is prevalent and sticky, leaving rings in the glass as I down the brew. No light passes through even when held up to direct light. The nose is much sweeter than I expected. Very fruity, up front with a softly bitter roast note hiding in the background.    The flavor is full of subtleties, with no one flavor really standing out to me. First sip, and I got a sweet malt that reminded me of bakers chocolate in a way. Next sip was full of bitter roast and hints of licorice. Each mouth full went back and forth between these two flavors, and upon swallowing I got a swell of dark fruit, presently sweet, with a warming alcohol note right at the end. The finish, in contrast to the swallow, is bitter malt that sticks to your tongue flavoring subsequent sips, altering the initial flavors. I feel as if I get hints of coffee here, but that may well be in my head as I know there is none in this fantastic beer.     The beer is a bit thinner than I expected, but still what I'd call a thick beer. There is mild carbonation that you can detect, but it in no way takes anything away from the ultra smooth feel of this beer. Overall this has to be one of the top beers I've had, Stout or not.

Quality imperial Stout with a good AbV at an unbeatable price. Drink it all year round!

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Old Rasputin is an old favorite. Time for a review! Into a goblet...    L: Looks like expresso; super dark, but not too thick or syrupy. Tons of very fine, frothy head that acquires multiple colors, ranging from khaki to cappuccino. Great retention: the lacing formed a nice flat ring around the top of the glass with dripping tendrils.    S: Smoke is immediately apparent, followed by black olives (trust me, I used to eat these out of the can as a child) quickly turning into dark roast coffee and gaining sweeter notes of raisin, plumb, and molasses, finishing in a tart blackberry. Probably the least sweet aroma I've ever found in a stout. Love that dark fruit. Could do with more.    T: Upon first sip, again smoke is immediately apparent, but the salty olive flavor takes over from there, followed by dried plum and blackberry (molasses and vanilla also make a short cameo). Unfortunately, the fruit is quickly demolished by strong espresso and tobacco notes, and the finish grows increasingly dry and salty, until ending in a salty, bitter dark chocolate with more black olive and charcoal on the very end. Definitely a tasty finish, I just wish the sweeter notes in the middle lingered longer.    F: Not as thick or creamy as a typical stout, but also not very sweet, which is generally preferable to me. Perhaps this is a necessary trade-off?    O: A fantastic stout. And the only good and affordable one that's widely available (at least in California).

Taste is dark chocolate and medium roast coffee. I dunno why people are saying this tastes like espresso, the coffee flavor has that light lemon tinge I associate with medium roasts. There is plentiful hop flavor as well, however the dominant malts leave it as a sort of herbal miscellany. Unlike most imperial stouts which become sweeter as they warm, this one - due to the hops- the herbal essences become more apparent. This makes it whilst warm something like a black IPA. Mouthfeel doesn't make itself known, which is to say it's perfect.     Overall pretty good. It's a style I'm partial to as well.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This is a great classic imperial stout. I love because it's drier than most American stouts. Usually, you get the coffe/chocolate stouts on the sweet side, or a coffee/tobacco/dark fruit stout on the boozy side. But this one has a taste and finish closer to a dry stout, which is great. Like a dry stout, it's not thick either. The nose is heavy on the coffee and dark fruits: prunes and dark grapes. A bit of cacao bitterness, but no real chocolate there. The finish is very long, roasted malt and coffee, very nice. No nuttiness at all, it's actually quite agressive, that's where you can feel its American side as opposed to English stouts. Usually a heavy stout doesn't go well with a sweet dessert, but this would definitely work because of its dryness.

Aroma is chocolate, a hint of raisins, coffee, and booze. Taste follows, but the bitter roasted coffee is more forward and the sweetness is less pronounced, although it balances nicely. Lots of alcohol burn but not unpleasant, I think it's what makes this such a good wintertime sipper. Mouthfeel is somehow thin and creamy all at the same time, with lots of carbonation and tongue numbing warmth making it a very fun drink. I wouldn't want this every day, but sipping this thing as I watch the snow coming down feels just about perfect.

Not the best stout but do like the fact it's a 9.0 abv but probably won't buy again.

Great sipper on a damp or cold day or as a partner to a glass of bourbon ;)  Terrific !!

Delicious dark chocolate aftertaste.   Feel: very smooth, easy to drink. Full bodied & moderately carbonated.     Overall: just an incredible stout. Will definitely seek this beer out again.

Chocolate is present in the finish giving it a sweet finish.    F: Smooth, but full bodied. Lingering slightly bitter dark chocolate after taste.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 L -- Jet black with a thick, tan head. Significant lacing   S -- Boozy roasted malts, barley, coffee, brown sugar, raisins, peaches, and jackfruit   T -- Dark roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, burnt sugar, almonds, and all the stone fruits   F -- Heavy, potent, flavorful   O -- A worthy classic    90/100    EDIT (11/20/17):    Tasting again, this time with a 1,000 lumen light that I passed through the beer to get a sense of exactly how dark it is. While not as dark as the likes of Speedway Stout or KBS, this one barely allows any light to pass through. Great retention and lacing for the ABV. Aromas are more one-dimensionally chocolatey/boozy than I recall, but the flavors and mouthfeel are the same. The current rating reflects this.     89/100

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout | North Coast Brewing Co. Poured from the bottle into a snifter, the head on this brew is three fingers thick medium brown, and finely bubbled , with solid lacing, and a body dark as night.    I smell generous booze amidst a very nicely brewed stout. You get the conventional notes of dark chocolate, black coffee, raisins, aromatic pipe tobacco, all with a nice-sized smack of dark rum IMO.     Tastes like a deviantly smooth, yet rich version of the aroma. The booze note sits really fantastically with the coffee&chocolate elements of the stout. Adequate warmth from the 9%, but not sharp or harsh;nice and mellow/inviting.    The mouthfeel is thick and slightly chewy with fair carbonation. This alcohol warmth is really welcome on this frigid night, I may add.    Overall, I'll rate Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout | North Coast Brewing Co. with a well-eared 4.75. It's odd to me that I'm just now reviewing this, as it is one of the very first "big" beers I've ever had at the very start of my "craft journey", so I'd just figured this whole time that it was reviewed by yours truly long ago. Nevertheless, you all know to grab this, 'Nuff said!

Alcohol is quite obvious, as I think it should be with this style. I really like this. Only negatives are that it might be a bit over-carbonated? Great beer for the price but doesn't quite match up to my benchmark that is Founders Imperial Stout. Close though. Cheers!

I didn't pick up any particular smells, then it is mid November and i can as usual not smell so good this time of year (my apologies, I will assume it has an average stout scent about it). Has beautiful chocolate creme head and tastes amazing and hardy! Thick enough to use a fork it need be ... thats a good thing :D Overall i will most certainly revisit this one!

The look, texture and mouthfeel are spot-on, but it tastes much too "hot" - the alcoholic burn is unpleasant. The rest of the flavor profile is a bit harsh too - ashy and dusty rather than roasty. I found I couldn't finish the bottle.

Smell: Subtle hints of chocolate and coffee  Taste: The taste does follow the nose. When I first tried this beer, it tasted like a typical great stout (e.g. a velvety-smooth texture with hints of coffee and chocolate), but there is a bitter aftertaste, that was actually a pleasant surprise (at least to me). Definitely a bit more hops to the flavor than your average stout. The 9% ABV is hidden very well.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth going down, which is what you should expect from a top-notch stout. Moderate carbonation.  Overall: It's not hard to see why this beer has garnered such high ratings from Beer Advocate: It is a very tasty stout that is perfect for a relaxing winter's night.

Pretty mouth-watering.     T: Minimally-sweet earthy malt backbone. When coating the pallet, this beer takes a quick turn towards a sharp bitter end note, and i sort of wished that the initial taste lingered longer before going full hop-ended, boozy stout on me. If swallowed quickly, the brew leaves a nice nutty taste in your mouth, which I enjoy a lot though.     F: Creamy and fizzy    O: Decent beer, for a beer so good looking and great smelling, the taste left me feeling short-handed... I haven't had as many stouts as some people have, so maybe I am missing something! I'd drink it again, but I don't think I'd seek it out or anything though.

Persistent sticky lacing--check.    Smell--Wonderfully complex--smoke, chocolate, and alcohol notes all very pronounced and providing a pleasing warning shot for the faint of heart.    Taste--Perhaps more aggressive than I generally like in this style, so the rating here (4.5) is a compromise--My "personal" meter wanted to render a "4" but because this is an unapologetic Russian Stout, I "averaged" that with the "5" it might garner from someone that isn't quite the wimp I am. Strong burnt sugar, coffee, chocolate, and vanilla notes, with a creaminess that gradually increases as it comes closer to room temperature. Very little "hop" balance, but that's fine, because the "booziness" and carbonation carry the day.    Feel--Big, chewy, and creamy. A perfect sipping beer. I would have said "perfect" on the score if it had just a tad more dryness on the finish.    Overall--Nothing much to say in summary other than, this is one of the finest imperial stouts I've tasted--even if it's a tad more aggressive than what I normally enjoy. For the style--a paragon.

I remember the first time I tried this thinking that it wasn't dark and oily enough for my liking, and then not giving it a second thought for a couple years until this week.    Dark and roasted malt notes. Creaminess emerges as it warms. Faint booziness but alcohol is well hidden for ABV. As I've gotten into craft beer more I've learned that all-out intensity Is not everything. This is intense yet balanced. Will drink again- probably sooner than later.

The smell on this beer is fantastic, coffee like with tiny hints of sweetness, like vanilla and slight chocolate, little bit of alcohol too. The taste is even better. It's got a warm very small alcohol taste, and a beautiful bitter/sweet coffee taste, exceptional. The mouth feel is wonderfully creamy and smooth. Always a good beer. Whenever you see it... Buy it! At least one!!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Black as death. Large, brown head is beautiful and persistent. Bubbly lacing all down the glass is one of the many rewards for glugging down this menacing beer.    Immediately greeting the nose are notes of bread, chocolate, mocha from the malt, and rustic and earthy qualities from the hops in support. Bitter/ baker's chocolate, more bread, toffee, treacle. Wonderful caramelized sugar and a deep, primordial earthiness.     Taste is a combination of chocolates- milk and dark, and mocha coffee. There is a biscuity component, but a rich breadiness and roast character dominate the malt bill. Bitterness is light and pleasant and cuts out toward the finish, as the beer ends with a dollop of warming alcohol and roasty-sweetness. Trace amounts of raisin and berry appear with warmth, but mostly it is the chocolate character increasing, with the roasted coffee tones never falling away. Tasty, complex, wonderful.     Full-bodied, slightly creamy. Very clean with some alcohol warmth on the finish. A very smooth after-effect allows for those delectable malt notes to hang around making music untrammeled.     One of the classic Russian Imperial Stouts, and it lives up to its legend. Incredibly complex in the malt. The rustic hops add a nice support. Something new each time I return to it.

It’s safe to say this is a beer fit for royalty.    AROMA - dark chocolate, roasted coffee, bready yeast, roasted nuts, hints of raisins and dates    APPEARANCE – pitch/jet black with a frothy tan head, impressive head retention with long streaks of lacing    FLAVOR – bittersweet chocolate, dates, espresso, cinnamon, raisins, black licorice, coffee beans, roasted cocoa, plums, bitter hop pineyness finish, hop/malt ratio balanced    MOUTHFEEL – Very rich and dense, bold with a creamy medium-full body, warming alcoholic sensation, moderate carbonation    OVERALL – Great beer for the chilling Russian weather, or in most of our cases, great for winter time sipping near the fireplace. Although a high ABV at 9%, this beer is easy drinking due to the smooth creaminess of the body. A delicious example, if not THE definition, of a Russian Imperial Stout.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Still one of my favorites after all these years. Outside of BA imperial stouts and spiced/specialty stouts, you can't get much more delicious than this. It's toasty, chocolatey, nice bitterness, strong enough, and has the mouthfeel that makes this a go-to nightcap/dessert beer for me. I would say 'desert island' beer, but then I'd be drunk all the time on that island, at 9%.

I like to use it in a Juniper berry based marinade for pork and chicken (just dunked a couple of pork loins in it for tonight) and the meats turns out amazing. The head is a joy to wait for as it falls, the smell is light malt and it's smooth while retaining all of the expected flavor and then some.

Good to have some in the cellar for a switch up.    Food Pairing    This nice big brew went well with........ Braised beef short rib in a tomato sauce.     Enjoy

Smell: The reek is of confusion, phobia, and midnight blitzkrieg. Chocolate factories incinerated to charcoal; scorched earth at its most evil and intense; memories of milk on the lips of a dying man; flickers of knife sweat as it quick-slits the cord linking body and soul; bread immolating itself to save the bakery; wood chips reaching into the furious atmosphere discombobulated; branches bled of all resin embracingthe air snapping; succubus licked tootsie roll pushed with unrelenting, though magically gentle, force deep into my mouth; sooty licorice and a chunk of boot from the first Hun gunned down discovered in grandfather's box of curios from the Great War; an undecayed grape dropping out of an emperor's tomb.     Taste: For a moment my throat became the conduit to an Awakened World. Then in dropped desperately baked burnt cookies exploding soil and secret coffee bean maps. Where aroma slashes the nostrils the taste is an unroughened arch, a passageway of absolute angles. Autumn fruits that have conspired to hide among the roots of their trees to witness the bitter-sweet passage of light into darkness; insatiable shifting of motion and stillness, euphoria and angst, leather whips and feathers; mud, of ancient origin, shuddering with the promise of rare life; baker's chocolate about to either destroy a cake or elevate it to saturnine tastes; syrup punched with wooden knuckles;     Feel: A sense of my breath being held hostage in a closet between fire and some oblivion hole.

There is some great lacing, and it has effervescent bubbles for days.  Smell - coffee, roasted malts, chocolate, and caramel.   Taste - roasted malts and coffee are overpowering, but there are some notes of chocolate and caramel as well. There's a bitter aftertaste, but it's more of a coffee bitterness as opposed to hops.  Feel - great carbonation, somewhat chewy body, but definitely smooth finish.  Overall, this is a superb stout. If you like strong coffee characteristics, then this is the perfect beer for you.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 pours jet black with nice frothy head. dissipates slowly. nose is nice charcoal and burnt malts with some licorace and pepper in there. mouthfeel is perfect with just right amount of carbonation. up front I seem to get some light hop prescence giving way to multiple layers of toasted malts with some sweetness layered in there making this a rather lighter tasteing russian than others I have had. ends with light dry licorace and leather prescence. overall very well done russian. all the typical flavors are there but not quite as bold as other russian stouts. very easy drinking for 9 percent as alcohol is well hidden. not my favorite as I prefer stone and founders but a must try if you like the style.

Just do yourself a favor and try it.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Really really good beer for the price. Look, there are better beers out there with barrel aging and what not, but this is a really really good beer and about a quarter of the price of comparable beers. It packs a punch and is full of rich chocolate, coffee, stouty goodness. You taste, notice the alcohol, but it's smoothed out by the roasty goodness.    I was disappointed by the barrel aged versions of this that do not compare to other barrel aged competitors, but for a straight up RIS, this is the standard and very very good. If you have not had this, try this first and then compare all future offerings of the style against this.    You will not be disappointed.    Good stuff!

Smells of bitter roasted coffee, charred chocolates and burnt vanilla/sugar cookie. Coffee very upfront on taste, warming bitterness to it. Smokiness comes out as it warms. I'm growing into liking coffee being heavily present in a non BA RIS. this is pleasant, not like my first experience with this several months back, I remember thinking day old Hardee's coffee would be preferred over this. Feel is a bit thin for my preference, still pretty close to being really darn good tho. Overall it's a 4 for me, which is saying a lot by my ratings, I tend to stay away from 4+ on most beers, just overly critical I suppose. Got a good local source to keep this in rotation.

This beer leaves a beautiful lacing.     Such a delicious and intense bouquet. Huge cacao nibs and roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, vanilla, plums.    This beer is awe-inspiring.   Nice and pleasant carbonation upfront.   A predominantly bitter beer, but its flavor feels somewhat balanced by the multifaceted sweetness. So rounded, the bevy of notes coexist in perfect harmony.   Coffee liquor, chocolate, cacao nibs, vanilla, caramel, roasted malts, just a hint of plums. Short after, that hoppy and roasted bitterness prevails, and it leads towards the aftertaste.  The finish is predominantly bitter with notes of dark chocolate and malty roastiness. It is a very long aftertaste, and that bitterness coats your palate in a scrumptious manner reminiscent of smoke.   Full body, creamy, chewy and smooth.     What a finesse, a world class beer for sure.

This fine RIS pours a coal black with a modest head of light tan foam that settles to a thick ring, thin layer, and very nice lacing. Nose of bakers chocolate, caramel, subtle char, vanilla, and coffee with deep roasted malts. Flavors exceed the nose with coffee and bakers cocoa on the front and sides, char hits nicely in the middle and fades into the back with subtle herbal hops and bakers cocoa, light vanilla, and subtle booze and subtle cream....well hidden alcohol. Excellent mouth feel, full mouth feel, fading creaminess, and a bitter malt finish. A stout drinkers stout....then again, if you are a stout drinker I need not tell you this.    A CLASSIC.     Period.    Cheers

Gorgeous completely black appearance with a little tan head. Smells very boozy. I know it's 9%, but I've had high ABV beers that don't smell so boozy. Tastes super boozy too. Kinda shocked me. Not what I expected. Booziness has been hidden so well behind other flavors in other big beers like this, why am I getting so much booze now? Not that that ruins it, I like alcohol after all, but still. Feels as heavy as a beer can get. Overall I'd like to try this again NOT on nitro and come back and see if my rating needs updating. I want to love Old Rasputin, but after this first experience with it, I'm left wanting more from it.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured into snifter. It pours a dark mahogany with a thick, mocha-colored head and extensive lacing. It smells of roasted malt, chocolate, burnt coffee, caramel, and pepper. The taste features all of the above but adds a significant malt bitterness. Unlike some stouts the bitterness isn't just at the finish; it's throughout the sip. As the glass warms, the baker's chocolate and burnt coffee grounds become more evident and there is a little more caramel at the finish. This stout is creamy, moderately carbonated, and while the 9% ABV is high in absolute terms, when compared to a lot of higher ABV barrel-aged stouts, this one seems moderate. Overall, it is a unique and delicious RIS, well deserving of its World Class BA Score.

Feel: You can feel a bit of some alcohol burn, but you can not blatantly taste it. It's smooth, thick, on the heavier side, almost a bit creamy?   Overall: It's very enjoyable and I can not wait to see what aging a few bottles of this does to the flavor profile. Would get again.

Then I got a 1/6 bl and there is a slight increase in rating:  Bottle:  L: poured chocolate brown/black, with large head that dissipated slowly (I hard poured it, shouldn't do that...)   S: not much of an aroma, slightly malty with hint of vanilla and chocolate  T: very good. Can really get the chocolate and vanilla flavors, with some notes of coffee and possibly almonds? Slightly nutty, but in a good way. Not too fond of beers with nut flavors  F: These can be quaffed like nobodies business, just beware: the 9% ABV will kick in and drop you on the floor if you're not taking these slowly.  O: Very good stout.  Nitro keg:  L: had gas too high, so head was creamy tan half glass. Reset gas, did a Guinness pour, and whole new world. Top 1/2 inch thick marshmallowy cream, below that thick bubbled creamy head, then dark chocolate color beer.   S: Not much of a noticeable smell at all.  T: Super creamy, smooth, flavors of good stout beer with very slight chocolate and vanilla. Absolutely delicious. You will get a slight sharp alcohol taste as well, due to the high ABV, but nothing like a vodka or bourbon. It's noticeable, which is odd when drinking a beer.  F: One of my new favorites. Guy was out of LH Milk Stout, offered this for same price. Now it's my 3rd favorite over the prior and Guinness.  O: A great beer that needs to be in everyone's fridge or kegerator. Also will get you crazy hammered if you drink it like a normal beer. So be careful...

Not the most beautiful I've seen.  S: Dark chocolate, malty, and slightly citric with a presence of alcohol.  T: Strong notes of chocolate with a hint of vanilla and a balanced alcohol taste. Fantastic but I wish the aftertaste carried a bit more.  F: Full-bodied and creamy with a wonderful carbonated fizzle. Excellent!  O: This is a rich and satisfying stout with an excellent mouthfeel. I wish it pushed the bitters a bit more.

An excellent three-finger head of whipped mocha foam has very good retention and leaves thick sheets of heavy lacing sliding down the glass.    Smells of cocoa, copper, oranges and leaf mould.    The taste is lush and full, toasted grains and fruit juice, raisins, walnuts and tobacco. A solid malty backbone with high-notes of slick, roasted bitterness and very little aftertaste.     Feel is smooth, medium-full bodied and mouth coating with just enough carbonation to get the job done.    Overall, an excellent, beautifully bitter RIS. Although, at 9% abv, it should have been a sipper, it was so damn easy to drink that I done drunk it right up. Whoops.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Appearance: Black with a red tinge around the edges, tan cap with very good lacing.    Aroma: Spicy hops over roasted malt. A hard to describe malt sweetness beneath layers of coffee and roasted malt.    Taste: Bitter hops, bitter roast malt, bitter coffee yet there's a malt richness going on as well.    Texture: Full and maybe even slightly fuller than full.    Overall: Roasty, burnt toasty, expresso yet with an underlying rich malt core. It is, as the name states, both Imperial and Stout.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Had this on tap at there taproom and bottled into a bomber many times.  First bottle.    L - Nice dark black with brown accents. Pours a brownish tan head, wish it had a slightly bit more head to give it that perfect look but its enough.    S - Very malty smell, chocolate with a little bit of cherry. It smells like a strong stout should. However the smell fades kind of fast.    T - WOW! First off it just hits you with that nice maltyness that you could smell, followed by a nice balance of coffee and chocolate with a little bit of vanilla and tobacco underneath. Just an awesome balance of bitter and sweet flavors.    F - That malt just crisps your tongue so nicely, it feels like a stout and taste like a stout.    On Tap  Poured into a 10 oz tulip glass  L - It looks so much cleaner, it pours a crisp tan foamy head that balances with the blackness of the stout itself. Overall its beautiful to look at.    S - Mostly the same however the maltyness is a little bit more pronounced, the smell of coffee hits you more.     T - Oh my damn, I didn't think it could get any better but I was wrong, after already being a huge fan of the bottle version the tap was phenomenal, the coffee and chocolate hit with a more robust flavoring that counteract the bitterness of the end of the beer. It tastes like a stout poured from heaven itself.     F - So much more smooth, I feel like I could drink it all day. The tan head itself is so foamy and soft it pronouncing a wonderful coffee flavor, the feeling of the foam you get from an espresso. Overall its just a fantastic beer.

Look- thick, dark, decent carbonation and head. Smell - chocolate, malt, sweetness, reassuring. Taste- I get chocolate and a slight coffee, a large sweet malty is also there which is lovely. Feel-pure heavy dessert beer. Fantastic beer I enjoy time to time in special moments in life. April was both it's on tap status and the birth of my first niece.

T-Extremely complex blend of sweet & bitter, chocolate, big coffee, also an almost sour tart sweetness that suggests a slight Bing cherry aspect at moments. Extraordinarily complex profile contrasting the range of the palate. I hardly notice the 9% abv.    M-Medium carbonation & decent creaminess.  O-Wonderful holiday sipping beer!

Aroma was just tons of burnt chocolate malt.    Big blast of roasted malt, relatively high amount of c hops, coffee notes from the roasting. Bitterness is substantial but not a problem. Covers alcohol very well. Great mouthfeel, thick, consistent, not oppressive.     Very affordable and one of the few reasons North Coast is still relevant. Would continue to bang again just as I have this one for almost 20 years.

No other way to describe it - coffee lovers delight, dark, tasty, potent.

Nose is malt and coffee, palate is coffee with some malt, moderate coffee bitter finish. Not really noting the alcohol. Does not seem like 75 IBU of bitterness. Nice mouthfeel. Probably the best RIS I've had. Gets better as it warms.

Rasputin pours black crowned by a creamy brown head that quickly dissipates into the black abyss. The nose is a complex blend of molassas, honey, stonefruits, and alchohol. The taste is even more complex journey through three distinct sessions. Session one is a bold tongue lashing of coffee, malt, burnt popcorn, and alcholol. The second act softens into a sweet chocolate base with notes of dried fig and cherry. The third act is marked by a mild bitterness, salts, and toffee as the malt sweetness fades. Mouthfeel is sharp, bitter, and thick on the front but tingly and dry on the finish. In the end, although Rasputin was pleasant company for this meal he's probably not a friend I'll invite over again anytime soon.

The odor for me is roasted malts, dark chocolate, nutty, coffee, vanilla, slightly chalky, slight woods. The taste for me is roasted malts, bitter chocolate, nutty, coffee, dry, slightly earthy, woods, bitterness throughout.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 My theory is that you can get a great stout from roasting the right malts correctly... or your can keep a yeast that creates complexity. But never have I had a RIS that does both well. This theory popped out at me when tasting Old Rasputin and World Wide Stout. Old Rasputin blends and roasts its malts exceptionally and WWS has a wonderful yeast.    Rasputin was not a man who made a positive contribution to human development, it should be remembered.  Nonetheless, the stout is exceptional. It Looks like its dark namesake. It Smells like a burnt chocolate dessert. It Tastes like that too; reminding you that sweet needs to be controlled by bitter. Feel lingers too long. But, that was solved by chocolate ice cream.     Rasputin is reviewed in Roger Protz' CAMRA classic "300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"  It also is listed in the "1001" and it deserves to be there.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Beer is very dark with a relatively thick consistency. Smell is pleasant, although you can get a sense of the high alcohol level. Very unique taste, just the right amount of richness if one likes stout beers. Light enough not to be overwhelming, yet it still achieves an abundant feel while drinking it.     The is my favorite imperial stout and I have tried every other one I can get my hands on, but nothing comes close to Old Rasputin.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout -North Coast Brewing by far is one of the best Russian Imperials I have ever tasted. This is a super dark beer. No light getting through this bad boy. Nice dark pour with a brownish head.   Super creamy and very well balanced. This beer is so good. It is an all year around beer. Forget the old habit of no stouts when it warms up. As this beer warms, it tastes even better. Regardless of the 9.0 ABV, it is well hidden.   In fact, it might be too well hidden !! You can never go wrong with this work of art ! I liked it so much I grabbed a case and put a few away to age ! The ratings , for sure match the quality. One taste and you will be hooked !   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Damn near perfect.  Thick head, color halfway between khaki and chocolate milk. Opaque black. Lagging clings to the glass as head dissipates. Coco and coffee in both the nose and pallet. Big full mouth feel with some light carbonation on the edges. Aroma sings with every sip. Big and beautiful but bizarrely approachable. I can't think of a better imperial stout off the top of my head

Only black and fairly well carbonated. I expected this beer to be heavy, but it wasn't. Abv is very well hidden, and the fast is of slight malt and slight chocolate.     Fantastic.

No light what-so-ever getting through this one. The foam is a nice deep tan/khaki color. Great head retention. Bubble replenishment is great.     Smell:  Very rich coffee, hops, and chocolate. There is a fair amount of sweet syrup that wafts up as well. There is a slight smoky smell along with a bit of caramel.     Taste:  A good deal of hop bitterness cuts through right up front. Then it kicks into sweet caramel, coffee, toffee, chocolate, and hops (rich and savory, not bitter). There is a nice roasted/smoky flavor in there. The sweetness starts to fade out, and some hop bitterness seems to come back as it dries out. I was left with a very nice aftertaste when the flavors die out. Tastes of smoked grains, caramel syrup, and hops linger on.     Feel:  Very rich, thick, and full bodied. Never goes flat and a bit oily.     Overall:  This is an amazing beer. I have seen this beer in the top beers list for a while. I can see why. This beer is very good with many complex flavors. There are sweet flavors, bitter flavors, slightly fruity, hoppy, and smoky. This tastes like a mixture of a few beers: Black IPA, Brown Porter, Chocolate Stout, Coffee Stout, and a Milk Stout. Very impressive. I bought this in a 4 – pack (as I normally only purchase singles of beers) and will definitely polish off the pack and purchase more in the future. This just may become one of my favorites.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 A great overall RIS. Quite possibly the benchmark for American brewed Russian Imperial Stout.    It pours as black as a Siberian moonless night. Excellent balance of chocolate, coffee, raisin and cocoa. Comes on bitter but finishes smooth, creamy and malty. Excellent full flavored Stout.    Had from a bottle.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Pitch black. Crowned with a creamy mocha brown head that lasts forever and leaves sheets of tan lacing along the glass. A black beauty.   The aroma, like the appearance, is a black abyss that beckons you in. You get loads of sweet dark chocolate, licorice, caramel, figs, raisins, and soy sauce balanced by an intense bitterness of petrychor, black coffee, leather, and tobacco smoke.  The palate delivers. You get tons of dark chocolate, cocoa powder, burnt toast, caramel, a little of soy sauce, fig, plum, raisin, burnt sugar, and black coffee. The balance between sweet and bitter is perfection. Finishes decidedly bitter, yet complex, with lingering notes of baking chocolate and espresso.  The mouthfeel is creamy, silky smooth, and ridiculously awesome to drink.    Overall: A hell of a beer. One of the best imperial stout, non-barrel aged, I could imagine. Absolutely beautiful.

Head was huge and fluffy, much more than I had anticipated. Smells like dark and milk chocolate, coffee grounds, burnt toast. Taste is similar, not as chocolatey as the smell lead me to believe: flavors of black coffee, dark chocolate, smoke, molasses, licorice...I could go on all day dissecting this beer. Super complex and it only gets better as it warms. Feel is creamy, smooth, and full. I got a 4 pack and I'm really looking forward to aging the other 3 and seeing how they change.

Although my tastes have changed more in favor of more drier stronger flavored stouts (think Yeti), this creamier stout is still so thick and delicious that I won't change my rating of 4. Still really like it.

Smells of dark fudge, fresh coffee grounds, raisins, roasted nuts and plain leafy hops.    Tastes of fresh baked brownies, creamed coffee, chocolate covered raisins, roasted nuts and more mild hops.    Feels thick and creamy. Full bodied with fluffy carbonation. Finishes dry.

If you aren't interested in trying new stouts, and simply want something you know will be consistently good, you should go with a four pack of OR.

Black like the night in January in Leningrad but warming like a fire used to roast the bear you just hunted. Unlike those attempts at stouts in other countries this brew draws you in like the mystic it is named after and proves that magic never dies. Enjoy at your own peril.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 One of my new favorite beers! I'm on a dark beer discovery kick. It's fun. I like it.    L - Dark. Almost black. Very little head if you poor it slow, but a nice creamy head if you poor it hard.    S - Alcohol is noticeable, but not too strong. It smells a bit like the lingering aroma of home brewed coffee.    T - You can taste the booze, for sure, but it's not over-powering. Drinking it goes down smooth, but it's got some bitter notes on the back end, like you just had a shot of espresso and chunk of quality dark chocolate (none of that sweet crap, but the 90% cacao stuff). I absolutely fell in love with this the first time I drank it.    F - It's super thick. Like heavy cream...oh yeah!
