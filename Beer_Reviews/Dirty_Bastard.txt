look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 A: Pours a thick 2 finger tanned head. Color is a deep ruby    S: Sweet barley, grain, wheat, some dark fruit. Figs, prunes perhaps? A twinge of a wine-like acidity    T: Barley creaminess throughout. The hops show up in blips, unusual for the style. Some roasted bitterness, same dark fruit     O: A fine beer. Some unexpected notes that holds me back from fully enjoying this beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A stronger than average pour was needed for thin finger of light tan short lived froth, a ring lasted on. Translucent deep dark amber-brown, pales to a basic brown in front of light.  Bold smell of malt, roasted and caramel with preserved apples and spiced pears.  Taste begins semi-sweet and lightly bitter, malty with fruit and faint smoke. The middle is sweeter from caramel malt with an orange juice tang. The finish is smooth and lasting, transitions into a mild yet spicy/bitter hops aftertaste.   Medium bodied, below average carbonation, smooth and malty.   Easy drinker, alcohol is cleverly hidden (the spice). This was another happy revisit.   
look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 12 ounce bottle into an English style pint glass. Date on bottle was 12/12/2018. Poured black/dark brown with a khaki head. Good retention and lacing. Faint whiff of coffee and dark fruits aroma wise. Flavor was good. Malty, chocolate, dark fruits. Mouth feel was smooth and creamy. About 50 ibus. Finish was clean without any lingering aftertaste. At 8.5 abv this is a sipper. I'm normally afraid of the higher gravity beers but "Dirty Bastard" is a delicious beer. Well worth the price. I would recommend this to stout/porter/Scottish style ale drinkers. Not for wee lads according to the label blurb and I would agree. (As a goof give to Bud drinkers and watch them make faces).

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 The nose on this beer is so excellent. Caramel malt, toffee. Very sweet malt flavor with some peaty-ness. That fades quickly into a more intense hop finish than one would expect with a scotch ale. I think that's why I like it so much though. The hop finish is right up my alley. I could see why other would be dissuaded from it within this style of beer. $8.99 a six pack for this 8.5% sipper is a great deal and it's a beer that I will pick up fairly often.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 L: Pours a dark red purple mahogany color with a small brown tan head and no lacing on the glass.    S: Sweet molasses, caramel and cherry, a slight note of burnt sugar. Some toffee, smells very malt without much hop. Also smells very inviting.    T: Molasses, caramel and toffee, slightly tart cherry, a burnt sugar that adds a slightly off putting bitterness. Not as big of a fan of the taste as I am of the smell. It is still pretty good but a let down after the aroma.    F: Medium body, not quite as heavy as I expected but still work.    O: Great aroma, flavor not quite as good but still a solid beer.

Pours a dark reddish brown with an off white head of foam, nice lacing.     Smells of burnt brown sugar, caramel malt, toffee.     The taste is burnt brown sugar which gives it some bitterness, caramel malt brings the sweetness, toffee, maybe some vanilla, kind of toasty.     Fairly light bodied with lightish carbonation, finish is decidedly burnt and bitter.     Not much alcohol interference, still a sipper that I enjoy.

Tiny floaters are present.    Aroma is very floral and herbal, all quite pleasant. Notes of cherries, prunes, dark fruit, some butterscotch, caramel, toffee, roasted malts, and smoke.     Much like the aroma. However upfront is the smoke and roasted malts, along with the bitter hops. Feels creamy smooth.

One finger off white head sticks around as creamy cap. Leaves behind a scattered pattern of lacing spots.  Aroma of roasted malts and caramel/toffee. Whiffs of dark fruit, smoke, peat, and hops.  Taste is sweet caramel and toffee malt, with the additions of smoke, prune, peat. Has some floral hops floating in the background. No bitterness, no char.  Fuller mouth feel, with good carbonation.  Yummy beer for in front of the fireplace, but it is sweet. Good enjoyment in the mouth, and brings up images of wind swept Scottish islands.

Smell - Gotta say i expected more from this, just lacking any real aroma. Not smoky or scotch-like at all but it smells like any average strong malty ale  Taste - I had expected this to be real smoky but adjusting my expectations, this is a real good beer. Flavor is quite sweet but with the bitterness taking over to finish it nicely. Very malty and medium-full bodied. Can't really detect the alcohol. Carbonation is only medium-low. There's not one flavor that takes over, very well balanced.    Overall, this packs a punch. Nothing really scotch-like about it but it's my first scotch style ale so i didn't know what i would be getting. Regardless, I like it a lot. It's filling but its enjoyable. Grade is an A

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Decent beer / dark ruby color with a strong malt taste coupled with bitterness. It’s definately a decent beer, but I prefer many of the other offering from Foudners more like KBS, and Breakfast Stout.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours a dark brown with thin tan head that quickly reduces to a solid rim. Sweet, porter-like aromas of malt, chocolate, caramel, cherry. Caramel especially shines through in the flavor, accompanied by a substantial sweetness. It's mildly earthy, smoky, and peaty. There's a moderate amount of alcohol flavor coming through. The sweetness is pretty well balanced by a fairly heavy dose of bitterness that lingers long into the aftertaste. Smooth and moderately carbonated.

Scottish spey casters visiting the Golden Gate Angling Club were overjoyed to find they could get it in the bay area to take back to Scotland where it has a following.

Very boozy from the start but as it warmed, flavors of peat and dates come through. At the finish the glass definitely smells of scotch whiskey and oak. Not sure if it's growing on me or if the high ABV is kicking in! Another interesting brew from one of my favorite brewers.

The beer pours bright medium brown with ruby highlights. The head is light brown and quickly falls to a few bubbles. The aroma is strong with malt (burnt sugar, earth, toffee). The taste is semisweet caramel with an earthy, medium bitterness. There are hints of peat and alcohol that poke through as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and somewhat dry in the finish. Overall, very good. Certainly a first place for value. Recommended.

The nose is sweet and malty. Picking up raisins, cinnamon, licorice, caramel, cotton candy, molasses and lightly toasted grains similar to toasted wheat bread. There is also a hint of booze. This beer is extremely aromatic.    Sweet and a bit boozy up front. Getting the raisins, caramel and a hint of chocolate. Vanilla is present through the middle and continues through the finish. Tasty stuff.    Mouthfeel is full bodied. Feels a bit slick. Carbonation feels nice. Not too bubbly.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Finally getting around to this one. Pours a brown color that turns almost mahogany in the light, with a good two finger off white head that slipped away pretty steadily. Some pretty good lacing is left behind, and a fingernail or two of a ring is settled on the top. Smells of some deep wood and smoke, lots of malty goodness though not as strong of an aroma as anticipated. Taste follows with a strong smoky and malty flavor, a bit of raisins and caramel come through and a hop undertone that keeps things balanced and well in check. Zero burn, finishes very dry and the lingering taste of a barrel stick with ya. Haven't tried Backwoods Bastard yet but this could only get better with some bourbon in the mix.

Taste is earthy, smoky, and reminiscent of aged wood. Surprisingly hoppy. Feel is a little abrasive, but overall good. Well worth a try, as it's widely available in many areas of the Midwest.

Maybe a tad sweet but still great when paired with dinner.

Head dissipates fairly quickly leaving some clouds and a thin ring.     Nose: sweet malts dominate the nose. Some alcohol vapor, dark fruits.     Taste: light roast malts, plenty of sweetness. Some bitterness on the backend.     Mouthfeel: a little oily, moderate carbonation. Nice.     Overall: I love Backwoods Bastard and haven’t had Dirty Bastard in a long while. While this is a decent Scotch Ale, I’m maybe not a huge scotch ale fan. Not very complex, more sweetness without anything to balance it. Ok but not a go to.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Dark brown body, decent lacing at the begining, didn't persist throughout the session though.    Strong caramel notes on the nose. Complex.    Flavor somewhat subdued compared to the aroma. Yes, caramelly, but strong, biting hop bitterness is also competing for presence.    Overall this beer is all aroma, and no flavor. Smells great, complex and inviting. The hop bitterness and flavor are WAY too high. It detracts from the caramel notes.    Not a bad beer, definitely worth searching out. Could use some fine tuning though--or let it age at least 12 months to let the hops drop out before trying it. My bottle was just under 6 months old according to the bottle date.

T&F: Follows the nose. Wood, malt, treacle, hints of whisky barrel, smooth, soft, lightly drying, warming alcohol in the finish.  O: Excellent winter warmer. Almost hides the alcohol. Way too drinkable for 8.5% ABV...! Super smooth.

Moderate body with a slightly dry bitterness in the finish. Excellent beer that would make a great dessert.

Taste follows the nose, with a strong malt presence dominated by caramel, bready malt and notes of toffee, dark bread, dark fruit: fig, raisin, with a hint of smoke and chocolate. Some earthy, bittering hop notes in there as well. Finishes with a medium, but kinda harsh, boozy bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel with low carbonation. All in all, this is nicely balanced, albeit maybe just a hint too sweet and boozy.

All I can say now is what the heck happened. Most of this 6 pack I ended up giving away to local friends. Founders puts bottled on dates on their label so I know I did not buy a 6 pack that was sitting on the shelf for a year or two. Maybe I got an infected 6 pack or something. Oh well, I guess I have to find another scotch ale to drink when I am in the mood for some. Cheers! C

Taste is more bitter than expected, fruity with plenty of figs, caramel and a hint of resin. Gets sweeter as it warms.    Mouthfeel is medium, well carbonated.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 March 21st, 2015 - Sassily named like San Diego's foundational Stone beers, Founder's Dirty Bastard is a chewy, salty thing. With a black dark body and a deep, malty nose, it offers little hints at first about the flavor profile. But that flavor is lovely and dark, rich with veins of licorice and soy sauce. More impressive than these, though, is the balance between the body and flavor, which are brilliantly engineered to match.

Founders does a great job with all their brews, and this is all around one of my favorite local beers. I struggle between this and Perrin's Black for my local  favorite "dessert" beer   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a whiskey glass, this beer pours out a deep caramel and dark ruby in color. It resembles a dark tea. It forms about half a pinky width of creamy khaki colored crown.     The nose brings a caramel, butterscotch sweetness mixing with slight peat and some fruit. Maybe some molasses.     The taste follows the nose well. Bursting with the butterscotch and caramel sweetness and a hugely present peat element. Slight roastiness, almost in the form of a roast nuttiness.     Smoky, sweet, some slight bitterness and a warming/sharp alcohol presence.     Overall, I’m rating to style, and this isn’t a style preference of mine. I do like the different aspects and layers this brew brings.

Rarely have I found a brew take a run at Guiness on my tongue, but this Scot ale makes itself well known with distinct character. If you like Twining's Irish Black Tea, Ghiradelli Dark Chocolate and a heavily peppered steak, this beer is for you. Rather, this is a beer for me. Respect earned, worth every sip.

Thoroughly enjoyable and an excellent example of the style. [12 oz. bottle into Sam Adams glass]

Tons of particulate sediment and little visible carbonation to speak of. Awesome lacing and retention.    S: I can smell the sweetness from a foot away. Like a cherry tootsie pop. A bag of fresh prunes left in the sun. Fruitcake. A bag of dark brown sugar. My mouth is watering. It smells sickly sweet, but I love it.    T: unsurprisingly, taste follows the nose. Arrives full-on sugarbomb, but a complex sugarbomb with layers of caramel, toffee, and perhaps milk chocolate with raisins and cherries. Middle carries some of those fruits but also a more pronounced whole wheat breadiness. Like one of those whole wheat breads that markets itself as healthy but has 10 grams of sugar per slice. Ending gets really hoppy and saves this from unpleasantness. Big herbal hop bite brings it all the way back to balance, and that is a long road, indeed.    M: thick. Hefty and malty. Syrupy. Slick finish, but somehow not unpleasant. The hippiness on the finish saves this.    O: each year I buy a dozen or so Michigan beers for the football season. I got this back in August for that purpose, and am I ever glad I did. Super sweet and bold, on paper Scotch ales should be right up my alley, but seldom are. This one manages to execute. Let's hope I can say the same for Big Blue!

Less head and retention than I'd assume for the style.    S: Molasses, deep, brown sugar, a heavy sweetness. It's like hummingbird food.     T: This is too syrupy. There are strong notes of brown sugar, caramel malts, little else. The sweetness is overpowering.    M: It's fresh and ready to go. It's thick on the tongue, heavy in the mouth.     This isn't my thing, and the bottle seemed fine.

There is a low roasted character to it with low smoke. There is moderate bitterness and a very low dried fruit (Plums) element.     Feel: It has a moderately full body with some alcohol warmth.     Overall, a complex malty beer that highlights malts with a bit of light smoke. A great drinking Wee Heavy.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Pours a dark caramel color, with a nice reddish hue when held to the light. Thick tan head with great retention. good lacing.  Smells of toasty bread, dark rum and a mild malty sweetness.  A caramel like sweet flavor dominate the flavor with just the right amount of boozy taste. Dark chocolate and coffee come in at the finish. There is a pleasant lasting bitterness from the hops on the finish.  Body is medium to medium/heavy. It was smooth from the start but I found it smoohted even more as it warmed.   This is a great sipper and very good example of the style.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 This beer is a dark tan in color, like light maple syrup. It smells a bit like butterscotch and caramel, and it tastes similarly as sweet, with a strong sugar taste from the scotch barrels underlying a deep, light ale taste. It is a fairly thick beer that never feels quite as syrupy as it tastes, which is a good thing.

A: Pours a clear, dark copper color, almost like black coffee, with a more than one inch, tan head. Good head retention and Belgian lacing.   S: Aromas of Irish whiskey and brown rum, cocoa/mocha and dark bread rind.   T: Sweet with flavors of molasses, unsweetened chocolate, and fig/raisin. Modest bitterness in nice balance revealing pleasant sweetness with a crisp finish   M: Medium to full bodied with strong carbonation. Creamy.  O: An excellent, uniquely American interpretation of a Scottish Ale. Toward a porter/stout and worth trying.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Poured from its stubby bottle, it appears a clear dark brown topped off with tan froth.

Sweet dark bread like zucchini bread, molasses, rich roasted malt, slight smoke and wood, toffee, a bit of bitter chocolate, finishes with grassy bitterness. Nice.  F. Leaning toward a full body, subdued carbonation, sticky resinous finish with just a little bit of drying, not boozy at all.  O. I've passed over this so many times, but boy am I glad I finally grabbed some Dirty Bastards. I am pretty sure this will be in my fridge most days from now on, especially during the cooler months, especially especially at like 20 bucks incl. tax per 12 pack. Well done Founders!

A surprising amount of hops joins shortly after and continues to endure throughout. Even with all the malt, this is shockingly balanced.

look: 4.5 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 1.25 | feel: 1.75 | overall: 1.5 Worst scotch ale I have ever had. This is a sickly sweet, disgusting beer. It reeks of burnt molasses and spoiled fruit. The taste is rich and overpowering, coating your mouth in an unsavory and unpleasant manor. I nearly spit this out the moment it hit my tongue.     Scotch ales are delightful and smooth. This beer is as delightful as baby vomit and as smooth as a train wreck.     A dreadful, embarrassing, abomination of a "beer".   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 And interesting scotch ale. It had an interesting aroma when opened. It seemed to have a hint of licorice, at least to me anyways; and that was not a bad thing. It had a deep dark-red stout like color when poured, a dirty bastard color. It looked and tasted like a cross between an ale and a stout, or an ale-stout hybrid if you will; which I liked. It certainly was flavorful and left a pleasing after taste. I will certainly wanting more of this one.

Taste - Rich as fuck, dry bitter chocolate flavor, sweet raisin and some prune towards the middle, loads of toasted bread and caramel make up the majority of the body. There's a hint of smoke but it only shows up towards the end. The finish is bittersweet and has a lingering roasted flavor that lasts until the next sip...niiiiiice  Feel - About full bodied, kinda creamy but still smooth, carbonation is just where it needs to be.    Overall - Just fucking drink it and shut up.

look: 2.5 | smell: 1 | taste: 1 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 1 Quick take: This is outlandishly bitter, nearly overpowering the flavors that are in this beer to the point of insignificance. Judging from how they made and created this beer, it’s obvious Founders is trying to compete with Stone’s Arrogant and other bitter beers. This isn’t a good beer for those who like a proper Scotch or Wee Heavy ale. Your alternatives will be Beam Me Up from Intergalactic Brewing Company, the Loch Down from Arcadia Brewing Company in Kalamazoo and, for a more lighter body, the Kilt Lifter from both Four Peaks Brewing Company in Tempe, Arizona and Moylan's Brewing Company in Novato (Don't let the not-so-classy beer name discourage you. They are good beer!)   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 L: Pours out a dark reddish brown that looks almost black in the glass; black in the middle with tints of ruby red at the corners. The head was huge, foamy, and tan. Retention was medium-poor, the head dying away fairly fast, but a thin tan ring remains and leaves some sticky lacing.    S: Rich dark malt complexities. Gingerbread, pumpernickel bread, fruitcake, molasses, chocolate, licorice, anise, black cherry, date, fig, and raisin.    T: Huge gingerbread, pumpernickel bread, toasted brown bread complexity, with hints of peak smoke. It's sweet and very dark fruity. You get molasses, a bit of licorice and star anise spice, along with notes of dried black cherry, date, raisin, and fig. Some dried tobacco as well.     F: Smooth, moderately carbonated, well-rounded to a degree that compliments the rich breadiness of this fine ale.     O: A damn fine scotch ale. Smooth, bready, sweet, and packed with flavor.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a thistle, the appearance was a semi-dark rugged amber to brown color with a two finger white foamy head that slid off at a moderate pace to leave some messy lace.  The aroma had some soft sweet caramel/toffee malts up front, subtle smoke, sly amount of grassy to herbal hops. Ended with some light cocoa powder and a settling dose of coffee sweetness, somewhat clean.  The flavor was rich and malty with the peat coming about to enrich as it should for the style. Aftertaste was rich and malty.  The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fair sessionable smooth aspect about it. Carbonation was nice and low as expected. ABV felt right on par as the brewer suggested. Malts are smooth and do not cling, nice and mobile along my tongue.  Overall, exactly what a Scotch ale should taste like. Stellar job at Founders!

RE-EDIT***** I just got a fresh 12 for a good deal at Martin's . My memory was correct. So malty good!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Slightly hazy auburn body, half finger of light tan head with a gentle pour, some legs and good sticky lacing.  Smells like figs, cherry, pie crust, raisin, lots of caramels, with a little bit of earthy and piney hops, chocolate, and tiny bit of smoke and dirty leather.  The upfront flavors are a jumble of caramel grains, figgy pudding, honey biscuits, walnut, and dried black cherries. A smidgen of cola and coffee, smoked caramels, charred blueberry. There's noticeable hoppy flavor and bitterness towards the finish, more than usual for a Wee Heavy, in a good way, with lingering toffee, caramel, grapefruit pith bitterness, and roast. Some alcohol presence, with more alcohol warmth, smoke, leather, earth, and dried fruit flavors as it warms.  Chewy mouthfeel indeed. Full but not sticky or sickly, sweet overall with a semi-dry finish.    Dirty Bastard is very good on its own and even better on a cool day on the mountainside with a big slice of fresh cherry pie, I can see why it's so popular. Speaking of, I enjoyed this a little more after drinking it alongside gooey pie that brought out woody tobacco, roast and smoke flavors and more hops for me while taking away some of the regular, plain malty sweetness.

Beautiful dense caramel head that lasts. Dense creamy lacing clings to the end. Hints of apple on the nose followed by lots of sweet malt. Taste follows the nose except the apple does not appear in tasting. Starts with tons of delicious malt flavors evenly tempered by the faint hop bitterness. Touch boozy. Amazingly smooth and drinkable despite its 50 IBU. Very well balanced with excellent carbonation which leads to a full bodied mouth feel that hits the mark. A wonderful Scotch Ale that has won a permanent place in my beer refrigerator.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Very good Scotch ale. The color is exactly the deep reddish brown that you'd expect it from a proper Scotch Ale. The smell is smooth and malty. The flavor is excellent with the rich malts dominating. The hops are in nigh unnoticeable as they should be. Great ale.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Dark ruby red gold color with light tan cap.    Aroma led by the scent of wild black cherry. I kid you not, that's what first lept out of the glass. Followed by roasted, coffeeish malt, Dark chocolate and a sense of dryness.    Taste is Belgian Quadlike, big, strong, bold and rich. On entry the roasted malt is primary with chocolaty coffee and dark tree fruit (cherry) trailing not far behind. Each time I raise the glass I'm greeted with the cherry/fruit scent first but don't actually taste those as strongly until the aftertaste where they linger.    Texture is full, chewy, creamy and denser than Army coffee.    This is big rather than complex with strength of character rather than finesse. The 8.5% alcohol is well hidden and not disclosed in either scent or taste. I don't know where the 50 IBUs went, I didn't see 'em, perhaps a slight tingle in the aftertaste but I wouldn't bet on it. For such a big flavor as this one carries hops are window dressing anyway. There are enough in there to balance things out. This is the culinary equivalent of a big hunk of meat hot off the grill.

I picked this up without any tips of hints at its quality; a VERY solid find. I would buy this again and will recommend to my stout loving friends. medium bodied, bitter up front, but only for a second. pretty complex but very well balanced. medium paced finish and leaves the feel of liquor in your mouth. fantastic beer overall. Highly recommend to anybody that enjoys dark beers that mingle the craft with scotch and the like. This beer is great when it is cold and I'd say it would be perfect for family get togethers in the dead of winter.

The head is beige and is minimal, no lacing is produced.  S: The aroma is very expressive for roasted malts, toffee and surprisingly green, as grassy and earthy. To some extent, near what a barleywine should smell like.  T: The taste starts with a very sweet beginning of roasted malts, toffee almost like toasted creme brulê but then it turns quickly into a harshly bitter end with over the top power on roastiness. The end of the sip is not very pleasant as it gives you a harsh bitter end followed by a big feel of booze.  M: The body is medium. Carbonation is high and perfect. Alcohol is very prominent. Bitterness is harsh although the IBUs present are not that much (50).  O: The sweetness of this beer is very interesting but I'll always tend to dislike the after-taste of this beer. It's not a barleywine. It's not a stout/porter. It stands in between but it's job it's not incredible.

Pours a dark, slightly hazy red orange with a thin light khaki head that dissipates to patches and light lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, plum and black cherry, light smoked peat. Flavor is somewhat dry caramel malt, plum, dates, light grassy hops and peat. Nice peaty, lightly hopped finish. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A classic Scotch ale profile to start, but ends with a little hop bitterness that is measured enough that it integrates into the earthy, smoky peat flavors. Nice malt that is not quite as sweet as many domestic examples of this style. Authentic and full flavored.

First scotch ale and now one of my favorite beers for sure.     Feel: kinda thick tbh but still very carbonated. Best taste and feel when very cold.     Overall it is a must try for any beer lover.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Alright gents, it's the Kernell again giving you yet another breakdown of another fantastic brew. Let me start off by saying I'm no fancy smancy beer tasting extraordinaire with a pedigree to boot, I'm just a small town fried chicken tycoon, but I know a good beer when I see one.     I find myself struggling to start this review because I enjoy this beer so much I am thinking about calling off work and going to get some instead of finishing this. Upon opening the bottle it has a slight bitter smokey oak smell to it, pour it in a glass and let it breathe though, and my friend you have a delicious smelling brew indeed. It boasts a nice head and is just how I like my women, thick and brown. Its tastes a tad bitter at first but its complex taste of smokey oak/wood, peat and sweet malt push thru and shine in the end. This beer isn't for boys, its for men god d#$n it. Sure its a tad bitter, but only for a moment then you're rewarded for your dedication and patience with a taste that rivals my famous chicken bowls.     If you're new to Scottish Ales, looking for a beer with big flavor or are a fan of some Bourbon Barrel Ales I would highly recommend it. Every time I seen that crusty grinning Irishman on the bottle it takes me back to that first time I tried it, its the same night I came up with the formula for my extra crispy chicken and we all know how that went.    Buy a sixer and open a bottle of success you dirty bastards, KERNELL OUT!   
look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Pretty strange brew, has big roasted malts but also has a weird Belgian yeast type smell/flavor..    Starts off sweet then a little peaty/Smokey bitterness hits you .    Drinkable but a little too much peat for me ..

So I feel like I'm trying a totally new beer.    Bready, caramel malts dazzle the taste buds and leave you refreshed but needing more. I guess that would be semi dry. Lacing is all over the place and maintains a head for longer than many a beer.    Damn fine smelling beer and almost coffee like porter taste and smell to it. Damn this gem just arrived at HEB and I LOVE IT. FAVORITE of its kind I'd say, I csn see why it'd bee Flounder's flagship ale. I bet is is godly on tap. One day!    Tell next time Founder's, really impressed. Thank you for an affordable, true craft beer of the style. Aw far as I jnowand Texas can't nearly meet this expectation I hsve now but we'll see.

I tend to struggles with scotch ales from Scotland being overly sweet and malty but this is balanced with 50 IBUs of hops brings and is a really great "wee heavy" American beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottle purchased at Total Wine in Spokane Valley for $1.99. According to the rear label, it was bottled on December 6, 2016. This is my first Founders beer that I've purchased for myself, now that they are sold in Washington. I've had Backwoods Bastard, thanks to Ri0, but never the standard version before.    Poured into an Iron Goat snifter, this was seemingly black in color until held up to light, which allowed a mahogany color to shine through around the edges. There was a tight, tan head that receded to a bubbly skiff after a few minutes. Beer neglige-style lace.    Sweet, candyish malt aroma, with a little bit of something suggestive of peatiness. Some plumminess as well. I also got licorice and toffee scents.    Smooth and sweet flavors at the first sip. The fruity and candyish notes from the aroma are present, but things are more complex. There's a smoky bitterness that melds with the sweeter aspects quite well. Deep in the background a mildly boozy alcohol flavor imparts a little "oomph" to the proceedings as it warms. Slightly mineral tang on the fadeout.    Fairly full bodied, which fits with the flavor. I haven't looked to see if this is a winter seasonal or not, but if so, it would make sense. Rich, creamy, coating mouthfeel.    This is a great American Wee Heavy. This is right up there with my favorite regional attempt at the style -Silver City's Fat- but I think this wins out by being a little more subtle, plus I love that it comes in 12oz bottles rather than bombers like most beers like this.

Look- deep mahogany flavor, big tan head with great retention    Smell- malty with a hint of hop    Taste- This really blew me away. Tons of sweet malty goodness upfront with whisky and caramel flavor. There are also hints of dark fruits like cherries. Those flavors by themselves are enough for this beer to be fantastic, but to top it all off there is a wave of hops that comes as the taste lingers on the tounge. Truly remarkable.    Feel- Smooth and full bodied, very nice.    What a brew. It costs basically $7.00 a bottle here in Seoul, so I won't be able to buy it often which is a real shame. Then again, maybe this beer deserves its own line in the budget so I can drink it whenever I want.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Very nice. Didn't get the "dark ruby" mentioned on the label but the color was a dark stained mahogany with Huge Tan head bubbLing over. Smell was nice but didn't really advertise the taste to come. Tons of malty goodness... sweet, roast, caramel, bread. Really didn't get much hops which worked. Warming alcohol on the tale.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 First time drinking a Scottish Ale and wasn't quite sure what to expect. It poured very dark with a tan head, looks very much like a stout. Personally I have trouble pickup any significant aromas with this beer, sorta reminds me of Moose Drool, a brown ale, but its been a while since I've drank that. At first the taste was fairly bitter imo, but it starts to disappear and more flavor comes out as it warms up. I also got just a small hint of chocolate taste at the end, really wondering if I'm actually drinking a stout. Overall its ok, not my favorite, but definitely improved as I drank more of it.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Mahogany? That is the color right? When you have a mixture of brown and dark red? That is what this is, replete with 1/2" off white head, great retention. Aroma of earthen malt, peat.     Taste, malty baby. This is like that thick girl without much flair. A lot of booziness, toffee, unsweetened, slight roast. Even a slight hop bitterness kick to it. 50 ibu scotch ale? Damn. Hoppier than to style for sure, but not a problem for me. Probably more booziness/abv too. So what. Mild smoke in the mouthfeel. Man, if they could only add lowland fog from the isles to this.     When they put this in barrels to become backwoods bastard, that is when it really shines.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Founders flagship beer if I remember correctly? It's obvious why. Great all around beer. and man, I could go for an 4 pak Backwoods Bastard right about now. Classic, a beer I've drank occasionally for many years now ... Beautiful, mahogany, ruby dark furniture look. Huge malted aromas and tastes. caramel, dark fruits, English toffee, smoke, peat. What I imagine Scotland to be like, dank, rainy, dark, mysterious. Bottom line, overall tremendous regular beer.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Single-serve    Pours a nearly-opaque ruby-brown with a excellent foamy head and retention, eventually fading to very persistent sticky lacing throughout the drink. This is a fine-looking beer.    Sweet aromas of toffee and ester, smoke, and bitter hops all unite in a fine balanced presentation,     Dark malts and dark fruits are very forward on the tongue, with whiskey and smoke close behind. And then, at the finish--a blessing of hops. This wee-heavy is hoppier than the standard of the style (and I'm not a hop-head by any stretch) but I refuse to mark it down for that. The hops take this brew to the next level. The hops and the crisp carbonation make for a remarkably dry finish for such a malty beer.    The mouthfeel is similarly inspiring given the malty sweetness. The carbonation and hops again prevent this from becoming a sticky mess. If there is any complaint, it is a "wee bit thin" for a "wee heavy."    Overall, this wee heavy may not hew perfectly to the brew standard for this style, but beers aren't dogs, so I don't care if this example of the "breed" is a little scruffy. The hops here are present and perfect and make for one of the best, if not the best, Scotch Ale I've ever had.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Deep ruby red body, mostly clear, with an off-white head about a finger or so thick that dissipates slowly. Smells of molasses, malts, and peat. Tastes smokey, a little caramel flavor, peat, and a touch of alcohol. Well balanced and smooth. Flavors pleasantly flow and meld together. Slight aftertaste but not overwhelming or unpleasant.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A: Dark brown with a red cherry tinge, unfiltered, hard to see any carbonation, a foam of tan rather than a head.    S: Whiskey, caramel and stinky foot. Scotch whiskey in particular, and oak. Butterscotch ice cream. Banana split.     T: Bourbon barrel scotch aged whiskey underpins a Belgian style dark ale. Getting flavours from both. Dark fruity fragrance, but definite wee heavy. Got the dark malt quality, the scotch, and stout like darkness, but carries the essence of scotch.     M: Heavy, bready body, highly carbonated.    O: 8.7 out of 10. Delicious malty wee heavy with a bad name. Definite punch to this one, dark and delicious with weight in alcohol. Would go well with camembert cheese, or goat or other white creamy cheese. I had this in Kalamazoo several years ago, but am revisiting it again in Chiang Mai, Jan 15th, 2017.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a dark brown, almost black color with a decent sized, beige head.    Smells of molasses, caramel malts, burned toffee and earth - rustic and inviting.    Has a very low carbonation, silk on the tongue, very sweet till mid palate until the finish, in which a pungent dryness mingles together with the initial maltiness.    Toffee malts with a rustic earth wrapping creates the taste foundation in this. Gets a very pleasant roasty touch during mid palate, enriching the malts, with a slowly evolving herbal note. After the swallow hops get way more noteable, producing an almost tongue numbing dryness of dried grass, replacing the sweetness by even more earthen toast in the finish.    Pretty darn wild on the tongue, sweet, roasty, then dry- convincing in every of its aspects with a great balance.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I quite like this ale. For some reason I have a hard time identifying the exact secondary flavors. The primaries are easier. I like the weighting of smokiness, hops, malt, and alcohol. All are present, but very balanced. Not subtle, but not over the top. Beyond that, I want to say caramel and butterscotch and maybe a hint of orange, but I only get that last impression on occasion. Sometimes I'll share a bottle with a friend, and I rarely want to drink more than one, but I don't mean that in a negative way. It's just a pretty substantial beer, and even a smaller quantity makes for a satisfying experience.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Looks: Dark ruby brown. Thick head with tint of the beer. Smell: Malty with light smokey peat and alcohol on the nose. Taste: is sweet, peaty, malty, and smokey, all of these overpowering any hop presence to me. Mouth feel is heavy and creamy. Overall: a great beer. I like a good Scotch style ale for a night capper, and this is one of my fav breweries. I have no idea how it took me so long to try this. I feel like this is the perfect time to drink it too, 5° F out. This has a warming effect. Great nightcapper beer.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Look - Dark amber with red highlights. Semi-translucent. 3 1/2 finger red-tan head. Lacings dominate throughout the glass    Smell - Malts, Dried fruit, and a slight caramel note predominate the nose (I'm getting more excited as I go). There's also a slight toasty smell at the very back end. It's not super complicated, but it sure is good    Taste - Caramel, Toast, and a slight carbonised bitterness are the initial tastes. There's definitely a booziness to it, ending with some warmth at the back of the throat. There's a very light sweetness at the front end which anchors those dried fruit aromas.    Feel - This is where this beer really makes a stand. It has a wonderful, fuller body. It's not particularly bready, but it has a wonderful weight to it, which is understandable given the higher ABV. In addition to its weight, it also coats the tongue marvelously. Smooth is definitely a good word to describe it    Overall - while I expected something slightly maltier, I am nothing less than satisfied, pleased even. Beautiful to look at, with an inviting aroma. It's drinkability and smoothness belies its booziness, though, so imbibe with care.

Aroma is chocolate milk, roasted malts, butter, nutty & slight hop notes. Taste is chocolate, caramel/toffee, butter, various dark fruit with subdued hoppy undertones & a slight bitterness.

After I scent again this is smelling even better, maybe something sweet in the back somewhere also. Thinner stout like flavor. I'm getting some of the scotch and alcohol flavor on the back end. Strong 8.5% that fades as you drink this one. Dangerous I'm upping my overall because the sum is better than the individual parts. This is decent but not my favorite style personally which might affect my final number. If you really like wee heavy ales this might be for you.

Dark brown in color with some ruby tinge, one finger of foamy tan head forms up and stands for a while before subsiding to some bubble film atop along with lots of lacing patch and spot on the glass-side.    The aroma is packed up with generous varieties of malty goodness ranging from brown bread, caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, slight roasted, wood, hint of smoke and peat, as well as cocoa, coffee, and creamy chocolate. Apart from that, there are also notes of dark fruits, citrus, and some astringency. Overall, it is quite malty aromatic.    The caramelized and sugary sweetness yet breadiness from malt are robustly upright and nicely mingle with some roasted yet smoky and peaty wood again from malt. Some astringency reveals in the middle with a character of coffee for more complexity sake while the finish is wrapped up by pleasant bitterness from both hop and roasted malt trying to balance and linger as the aftertaste.    The body is between medium and full with some lively carbonation that is excellent to carry all the things well inside the palate, very smooth with a wave of silky effervescence and dry finish.    Very intense malty brew with many varieties of malt usage, anyway, I would consider as easy drinkable since it is not too hefty or cloyingly sweet but nicely balance and very tasty.

I could taste the scotch with perhaps hints of oak or maple. Overall the beer really went down well and I would have it again.     F - Good texture. Not too carbonated that it left me feeling gassy or full. Smooth and good for drinking slowly.

Poured from the bottle into a snifter, this head on this brew is two fingers thick and light tan, with lateral lacing, and a clear profoundly dark reddish brown body.    I smell a fair bit of scotch boozieness, along with approporiately accomodating notes such as hints of oak, vanilla, freshly cleaned leather, and a tad bit of candied dates and raisins.    Tastes like a malty, yet smooth adaptation of the scent I've described. Nothing is too sharp or harsh, especially as it warms. I'm also noticing a pinch of black licorice/anise that make me wonder how well this would blend with Jagermeister. I digress...    Mouthfeel is just slightly above medium with mild carbonation. Alcohol warmth is mellow and inviting.    Overall, I'll give Founders Dirty Bastard | Founders Brewing Company a 4.5. A more viscous offering that will liven up a dull, dreary late fall/early winter's eve with zero effort. This would be a good "old world tavern" brew for a night of total nerdiness i.e. LOTR/GOT/"Vikings" viewing, fantasy RPG's, and pagan/folk black metal. SKÅL!

Lacking on the nose, the smell does not indicte the rich complex flavor inside. Smells of sweet malt and caramel, faint smokiness, undertones of dark chocolate.  This tastes amazing! This is the big time stout. Front is boozy, a little bitter, and warming- this is an 8.5% ABV and burns like it. Hints of peat and roasted malt. Aftertaste is unexpected and truly phenomenal, strong sweet caramel persists with a boozy taste and little peat-bitterness.  Definitely a good winter beer- a little over carbonated, and I would encourage drinking this closer to cellar temperature. This is a strong beer and you can feel it. Warms you right up on a cold Midwestern evening.  Overall a top-tier winter stout. Definitely recommended. A lot of unexpected flavor in this beer.

There is a decent amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The color of Dirty Bastard looks like cola, not saying that is a bad thing. You pick up on roasted grians and malts in the smell of this brew. Also you pick up on some nice earthly hop notes and some sweetness in the smell of this brew. The look and smell of Founders Dirty Bastard is really inviting. Now for the taste, it is rich, but bold with flavors. There is a lot of roasted grians and malts in this brew. Then you pick up a nice bit of hops. I really like how heavy and how complex this brew is. Founders Dirty Bastard has a real super nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. I can't get over how smooth this brew goes down. It is really hard to pick up on the 8.50% ABV in this brew. The mouth feel of Dirty Bastard is Bold, Rich, Smooth, Heavy, and Refreshing. Overall I'm giving this Scotch Ale a 4.75 out of 5. I will definitely buy this brew again. Founders Brewing Company, did a real nice job with this one. If you like roasted brews look this brew up.

Taste has a hit of alcohol up front with a mix of sweet, notes of chocolate and fruit round out this beer nicely. Overall a bite to finish, I can taste a lot of alcohol in this beer which is ok but would be better if less present. I may need more of these to really get a final view, good beer but it had a lot of bite to me.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 One of the most delicious beers I've ever had and continue to but and will continue to give Founders credit for being one of the greatest beer companies in the world. Helps yeah Michigan!  Poured into a goblet the color is a dark red velvet with a bubbly head that soon turns pitch black with a stained foam glass and a very thin white lining head. The texture is velvety, malty, and sizzling.  Taste is of dark sweet malts, chocolate, oak, Christmas, scotch, licorice, vanilla, raisins, and nuts. Almost tastes like a barley fermented Brandy. Strong alcohol notes but smooth for an 8.5 abv. Perfect for a winter's day.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Inch of creamy, tan head rests on top of an opaque ruby-brown brew. Foamy head collapses fairly quickly to a beige film concealing the beer's nature from bird's eye view.     Lots of subtle treats for the nose. Shortbread, lady fingers, malt balls; and then later- a bit of cherry or almond, and strawberry. The strawberry note, in particular, I find increasing as the beer warms. Mostly, though, it is rich malt on display. An assortment of sweet cakes and breads, with a touch of nuttiness. It's all there. Small note of floral hop has a time announcing itself, but shows up on occasion.     A nice, clean, and rich malt character is the first impression; overlaid with a smokey and tart EtOH character. Toffee and shortbread all day long, with those fruit characters (cherry, strawberry) playing light players. Hint of smoke may come from the booze or somewhere else, but adds ever-so-subtly to the beer's overall impression- which is that of deft balance. Epitomizes what I love about the style- the strong malty notes, alcohol warmth, and depth create a comforting, corner-of-the-bakery climate inside the drinker.    Mid-full body, creamy, and mouth-filling. Absolutely wonderful and well-matched to the flavors on display. Hell of a sipper, with the perfect amount of carbonation and alcohol sharpness.     Tremendous, tremendous beer.

It's very malty is smell, almost creamy and with 8.5 alc. volume it really sneaks up on you. The flavor also is outstanding. Can't wait to find other beers that compare or perhaps be even better.

look: 4.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 355ml bottle into a Snifter glass. Paid £3.10 for a single bottle.    Pours a clear, very dark brown chestnut body, that transform to a bright beautiful ruby when held to the light. Plenty of fine streaming carbonation is visible below a dense, foamy, one-finger in height, light tan coloured head that slowly reduces to a thin film and collar, leaving behind excellent amounts of sticky, soapy lace.    Predominantly malt forward; the nose is led by an abundance of rich and sticky sweet toasted malts. Notes of caramel and toffee are faintly perceptible underneath, along with hints of dark fruit, ripe black cherry and some obvious alcohol on the end. Taste roughly follows suit, leading upfront with sweet, heavily toasty malts, caramel and toffee profiles. Mid palate, sticky dried figs and dates join fleshy dark cherry and tart berry sweetness before hop bitterness and a drier roast profile builds towards the finish. Medium to full-bodied with a low to moderate amount of soft carbonation, the mouth-feel starts rich, slick and smooth before drying slightly as hints of earth, smoke, spice and bitter hop profiles overtake initial malt sweetness. After the swallow, assertive resinous hop bitterness makes the beers 50 IBU’s known; lingering on the palate with mild astringency while a large alcohol bite provides notable warmth.     Overall this is a decent beer. Rich, toasty and reasonably complex, its seven-strong malt profile starts well, but is later let down by both a slightly out of place and overzealous hop bitterness, and obvious alcohol, ultimately detracting from taste and drinkability.

Pretty carbonated to keep from getting overwhelming. Long lasting finish, unlike my typical performance     O:. Delicious rich malty beer with just enough balance from keeping it being too much. This is you classic malt bomb in ale form. Where's the fire, would be excellent with smores . Excellent showcase for the style.

The alchohol taste and feel is strong with this one, lacks the peatiness of other scotch ales, but has enough hop bitterness.  I do not agree with the fruit taste or smell...do they put plums in this? I dont see it, has more of a coffee after taste.     Founders is up there with the best in overall quality, and this ol dirty bastard likes it.

Beer could be manly as eff.     Look: Dark brown, when held to the light definitely has a reddish tint to it as well.   Smell: Malllty, not much hop aroma (though this was an older bottle), maybe even some notes of vanilla and wood  Taste: intense malt flavor, almost a bourbony aftertaste, combined with a pleasant bitterness from the IBUs to balance out the malt intensity  Feel: Smooth, and leaves a wood aged spirit flavor in the back of your mouth    This beer is a beast, always one I introduce to scotch and bourbon drinkers who say they "don't like beer".

On the nose, big aromas of Tennessee mountain fudge, chocolate covered raisins, gourmet Italian chocolate ice, dates, sugarplums and mild vanilla.    This is a chocolate bomb. Tastes of Swiss milk chocolate, mildly dry and bitter roasted chocolate malt, heavy cream, custard, cacao nibs and vanilla beans.    Feel is smooth yet slightly boozy. Light in body with light carbonation - silky and luscious. Sessionability is low however since it's quite sweet and chocolaty.    While I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these in a single sitting since it is quite a strong and intense- this is an absolute delight to drink. This is the type of beer you have as a nightcap, at the end of a long night of drinking or as a desert after a nice big meal. Come to think of it I don't see what's stopping you for having this for breakfast in the morning either :)

Unfortunately the smell is sharp with alcohol, and the taste has a dark hint of oil. Mouthfeel is okay, but you don't want to savor it by keeping it in your mouth for long. Aftertaste has a too much tang and too much taste of alcohol rather just the warming feel of it. Other Scotch ales just as high in alcohol, including wee heavies, don't have nearly the sharp taste that this one has. A disappointment, not nearly as sweet and tasty as Belhaven's Wee Heavy or McEwans. Still looking for a top-notch U.S. brewed Scotch/Wee.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 A nice brew. Good experiment from Founders. Pours good, looks good, tastes pretty good, feels good. But alcohol overpowers in front, the middle and all the way through making other flavors barely noticeable. Experimentation with serving temps doesn't add complexity to flavor. At 10 bucks a sixer, It's a reasonable interpretation of a mediocre Scotch house ale if you've never had a real one. Nothing special. Not bad at all. Just not an interesting brew. Might be worth aging for a year or two.  Edit: At approx 60°F, other flavors shine through. Plum, raisin, apple, earth, more buttery. Where on this site do we talk about aged beers? I will put a few of these away for a year or two. Report back then.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4 12 oz bottle Born on date: 4/28/16. Poured at 60F into a snifter glass.   A: Brown with a ruby hint. Hazy appearance. 2 finger tan head with good retention.   S: Alcohol with some malty sweetness typical of a wee heavy or other high abv malty styles also some astringent qualities.   T: Caramel malt sweetness/alcohol/astringent properties/earthy hops.   M: Slightly thick but not overly syrupy. Carbonation medium. Appropriate for the style.   O: Overall, brewed well to style perhaps with more earthy hoppiness than usual. A bit astringent/boozy for my tastes but good for a winter warmer type beer. I would generally prefer a belgian dubbel or a quality doppelbock though in any situation that this beer would be appropriate.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This has been a favorite for a long time and I just realized I've never reviewed it. Poured into tulip glass. It pours a dark brown with reddish hues with one finger of ecru-colored head and lacing. It has a really aromatic smell of roasted malt, raisin, caramel, brown sugar, and a whiff of tobacco. All of the smells are present in the taste plus the telltale peat and a little bitterness at the finish. The tastes blend together very well. This ale is medium-bodied, creamy, and the 8.5% ABV gives it just the right amount of substance. Overall, Dirty Bastard has been a favorite of mine for many years. I'm impressed that the quality persists regardless of the volume brewed. This is one of the beers that attracted me to craft and I enjoy sharing it with macro-drinkers.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This wee heavy pours a dark reddish brown color with a somewhat small tan foamy head. The smell is really intriguing, very malt heavy, a little sweet, smoky, and a hint of alcohol. The flavor is quite complex and unsurprisingly malt heavy. There are flavors of peat smoke, dark bread, a little bit of chocolate and caramel, some dark fruit, and alcohol in the initial taste, which is kind of whisky-like. There is a surprising amount of hops in the finish though that also imparts a lingering piney flavor in the aftertaste. Although on closer inspection it does say that it is 50 ibu and this brewery liberally hops their beers, so it shouldn’t be that surprising. The finish is semi-dry and the body is on the high end of medium, but a little bit lighter than I would have guessed based on the smell and there being 7 malt varieties in the beer. The flavor is good, but not as amazing as the smell. It is a pretty interesting, very robust beer though, which I appreciate. It’s definitely worth trying and one of the better and more interesting examples of the style that I’ve had.

Aroma to me is kind of mute, slight hints of tabacco, toasted malts and wood. Some hints of sweet yeasty character as well, reminiscent of bananas and caramel. Taste is an overall malt bomb. Sweet malt compliments that dark fruit and Belgian yeast-like flavors that come through. Some hints of chocolate, toffee and caramel as well. Mouthfeel is medium carbonated with a little oily characteristic going. Overall a malt bomb with just enough bitterness and complexity to not be overly sweet.

It reminded me a lot of a Porter with the smell and the taste. Lots of Chocolate and carmel notes that jump out at you with this beer. It's not as hoppy as most Ale's I have tried. Very easy drinking for a higher ABV beer. I would recommend this beer to anyone and I will be buying it again.

M - Full bodied, well balanced, nice complexity, medium plus acidity, medium carbonation and a malty sweet ride.    D/O - This is one big beer. I liken this and old scotch ale to the porters in density and flavor. Not an everyday beer and the sweetness is delicious but thirst quenching it is not. Huge flavors but nothing over the top which is nice and the balance of sweet and bitter is gravy.     Final thoughts - At 8.5% ABV and around $20 a 12 pack this one is for sharing and parties. Also, aging one of six of these isn't a bad idea either. Enjoyed it out of the can more than the bottle.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 This Dirty Bastard has full rich caramel and malt tastes but these quickly layer into a distinct quinine finish. (For those not familiar, "quinine" is a traditional drug to treat malaria, but is taste is bitter and not hops-like.) This is a really interesting brew. But it's not an all-night-long beverage or an everyday fair.

APPEARANCE: dark velvet body holds a single-finger near-brown head that is creamy and resilient... lacing is spread in smears... love the half-finger head that remains throughout the drinking... AROMA: nice peat, smoke and leathery earthiness, combined with pear, raisin, cinnamon and ... PALATE: dry, bourbon-like draw with a subtly BIG, chewy strength... long, lingering finish... warming and surprisingly crunchy, suggesting hoppiness... TASTE: I just told my wife that this beer is "sinfully good"... and that is no lie, with its scotch approximation that brings raisin, grapes, peat and subtle smoke... a rich, complex,., sippable beer that is the pleasant accompaniment to an actual scotch... OVERALL: a fantastic, big, slowly draining beer that resonates with a malt-heavy finish...two bottles in, and the effects are staggering... strong, solid and another feather in Founders' cap...

As it sits, the flavors and olfactory notes start coming out more and more. It's got a very woody characteristic on both the nose and the tongue, quite malty and sweet, maybe some prune or currant notes in there. A small amount of bitterness lingers at the end, but it's more from the woodiness than any hop flavor. I'm just starting to get into Scotch Ales in general, but this one is just a bit underwhelming. An interesting flavor, but not too much going on smell or mouthfeel wise.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours a deep brownish cranberry color, very slight vanilla colored head. Aroma has a caramel and vanilla note. Taste is malty, chocolatey, big and bold. Feels sticky and dense on the tongue. Finish is a little sweet, like toffee and leaves an aftertaste you won't soon forget. This is a bold beer and I really like it.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.25 Poured mine itno a pilsner glass, because I can.  Pours a dark coffee and caramel colour, very thin foam head which lasts seemingly indefinitely since I am taking my time with this.  Smells dark, almost chocolaty like a stout.  Tastes of roasted coffee and dark chocolate mix.  Feels great though, I don't much care for the stout like chocolaty taste, but it has a nice feel to it, bold flavor. You could almost say the strong taste would hint at its strong ABV.     While not my favorite, I do think this is a good one for what it is, even if it isn't of my preferred tastes.

Look: Dark red amber color, slight haze. 1/2 inch light tan foamy head that dissipated to a thin foam that held up to the end. Very nice lacing.    Smell: Intense caramel and citrus aromas, roasted grains    Taste: Coffee and caramel, roasted malt, slightly boozy    Mouthfeel: Creamy with modest carbonation, full body    Overall: I checked the style attributes after I took my own tasting notes and feel that what I experienced matches well with what I read about Wee Heavy/Scotch ales. A very enjoyable drink that first put me in mind of a Porter but with more sweetness. A solid sturdy drink for after work, after dinner or whenever but with the 8.5% ABV more than a couple will settle me down in a hurry.

I just did not like it, might just be a case of poorly aligned preferences though judging from the beer's high rating.

However, this packs a deeper, dark caramel flavor with a punch of alcohol that makes it an all-too-easily drinkable scotch ale. An excellent overall beer.

It has really nice lacing.     It has an aroma of dark fruits and roasted malts.    It is sweet and a bit nutty. There is lots of raisins, a bit of char from the malts and molasses.     The mouth is slick and bit thick.     Always a nice beer to spend some time with.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Founder's Dirty bastard Scotch style bottled on 12/22/15; tasted 3/14/16 at about 50F.    Beer with a very deep amber color, otherwise clear, and cream-colored head. Aroma of malt and possibly a hint of yeast. Very little lacing.     Extremely full malt flavor, with just enough hoppy bitterness (I don't sense the stated 50 IBU). The label promises smoke and peat, but there is little in the initial flavor. The label says 8.5% alcohol, but it is just perceptible through the malt body. The aftertaste is a malt flashback, with maybe a hint of smoke.    In the age of overwhelming hops, this is a rare example of a beer that gives a malty experience. I think this is true to the strong Scotch ale style.

Finger width tan head with excellent retention.     S: Strong malt presence at first consisting of pumpernickel bread, caramel, brown sugar and some citrusy hops, complex on the nose.     T: WOW. So complex. Caramel toffee and baked bread leads off well at first with a sweetness and yeast character but then it mellows out into a coffee astringency and finishes well with a balanced hop and malt bitterness.     F: Medium-Full body, creamy and smooth, like velvet on the tongue but with a crisp finish.     O: This is another outstanding beer by Founders who never seems to disappoint, so complex and delicious. Just blown away again.    Update: Poured from 12oz short bottle into Bell's Hopslam Tulip. Bottled on February 10th 2017.     L: Rich cloudy mahogany, finger width beige head, slowly recedes into frothy bubbles and a solid ring.     S: Super rich aroma of caramel and toffee, dried fruits, currant, plum, cherry, a bit of smoke. Some breadiness too, like crusts, molasses and brown sugar.     T: I really love this beer. Follows the nose very closely, very complex. Absolutely delicious. Faint presence of alcohol.     F: Medium-Full body, high carbonation, smooth and creamy, crisp.     O: Again a stellar beer. Really underrated IMHO.

This is a beer that should be appreciated for its mastery in every way.

A beer to be savored as it slides down your gullet and warms your insides. Do I smell peat or is it that I am being transported to Scotland? A very strong finish that almost feels like scotch (whiskey). Overall I would highly recommend.

I smell prunes, esters, and a pinch of smoke and caramel. Full flavored and sweet with some earthiness flavors, toffee pudding, dry earth, and dried fruits make much of the delicious flavor of this beer. Alcohol is hidden well. Swimming in a creamy and smooth body, the Dirty Bastard isn't so dirty after all.

Lots of specialty malts in this one, as the beer's description confirms. Despite the deep maltiness and caramel, it is easy to drink, albeit with some alcohol heat that makes this a sipper. An enjoyable beer but I prefer the package of smoke and hints of roast you get with ol chub.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 from a single almost two years old into a cervoise. pours a slightly hazy dark burnished reddish sienna, very little head that subsides quickly and no lacing. nose is great: brown sugar, cherries, caramel, and a touch of leather...promise of some whiskey. taste follows the nose, but sweeter and smoother on the back end than I was expecting, even if it also has a little bitterness and dries out quite a bit too. mouthful is pretty great, with a ton of body but not overpowering or too much.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 This ale is something of an exercise in taste intelligence for me.  Six years ago when I certainly was more hop-intolerant than I am today, I surprised myself by liking this ale. The hi-content hops (50 IBU) did not overwhelm what seemed like well-blended malts.    I have had a couple of dirty Bastards since the first time, and the hops increasingly started to bother me. But while this was happening, I curiously was becoming more tolerant of hoppier styles such as American IPAs.    What I discovered was that as I sampled more from this style (particularly those from Scotland), I came to recognize that Dirty Bastard does, in fact, have too many hops compared to the general way in which Scots blend malts and balance their beers. The malts of a Scotch ale should not have to contest with the hops... which is what happens in the Founders rendition. The taste buds get some sweet malt and salivate and, then, the hops appear and dominate the finish turning a comforting style into too much stimulation.    Not to start anything.... But, has anyone suggested that there be a style called an American Scotch Ale? I know, it is too early because the style has not caught on here... and it would sound funny. But it is fair to pint out that there is an American rendition of other British revivals.    reviewed and slightly revised 4/26/16, 3/15/18

Taste is malty with notes of smoke, caramel, roast and a bit of cherry. The finish is hearty with nice warming feel. I don't usually get scotch ales but this is a top find!   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 12oz bottle(dated 7/8/15, been cellaring a bit) into a tulip. Deep garnet red in color, dark but also crystal clear... I did pour this one carefully to avoid disturbing the sediment on the bottom of the bottle. Topped by a dense two-fingers tall tan head. Copious sticky lacing. This is a pretty one, indeed.    The nose on this beer is rich, with sweet brown sugar-ish malts intertwined with big earthy, smoky notes, and a touch of leather. Just a hint of whiskey-like alcohol hovers in the background.    On the palate this beer comes in with a one-two punch of sweetness (dark fruits, dried cherries, raisins) followed soon by bittering notes from the heavily caramelized malts. These seem to meld and transition into tones of semisweet chocolate leading into a drying, smoky finish that lingers but doesn't overstay it's welcome.    Feel is big, rich, and creamy, with fairly low carbonation. Alcohol is there, but very disguised, just slightly warming... this one drinks pretty quickly for an 8.5% ABV beer.    An impressive scotch ale that hits the style squarely. Big enough in body to make a nice evening sip on it's own, but the controlled alcohol and balanced flavors would pair this one nicely with a fine meal. A great choice for when one wants a 'big' beer, but a stout might be too much.

Looks a little like Cherry Coke, actually. Smell has some faint cherry, smokiness, and earthiness. Taste continues with those notes, plus some caramel maltiness that develops throughout the palate. I got a lot of alcohol out of this, with intense warming sensations. It's not unpleasant and the alcohol feel and flavor balances well with the other flavors going on. Kind of reminds me of a less sweet Jack and coke...with a lot of Jack. Surprisingly easy to drink, although it was a lengthy sipper.

The 4 months in the bottle was good to this. A bit roasty, some chocolate, that peat that you'd expect from the style and a wee bit of that Irish Red characteristic underlying the previously mentioned notes and soft malt.     No booze whatsoever for the ABV. The mouthfeel is so soft and creamy. Everything I look for in a malt heavy beer. Near perfect beer for me at least. Very well executed and extremely highly recommended. A steal for the price and format.

There is a lot going on here.Smells of raisins, figs and something like smoky peaty malts. The smell told me I was in for a big malt bomb of goodness.    The taste was a great richness filled with the sweet taste of raisins and roasted malts. There was also a bit of a smoky, musty taste pulling through.    The mouth feel is definitely medium with some alcohol warming going down. There is a nice balance of the hops in here that help this huge malt bomb balance out very nicely.    Overall seven varieties of imported malts makes for a delicious malt bomb that just tastes great. While not quite a sipper like an imperial stout this one sure comes close for me.

APPEARANCE: pours a clear, dark brown color with less than one-finger white head that quickly dissipated until just a thin, unbroken layer of small bubbles remained, there is significant lacing on the glass, lighter carbonation.    SMELL: sweet caramel and roasted malt.    TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet caramel then a roasted note, the 8.5% ABV is well disguised.    PALATE: medium body and lighter carbonation.    OVERALL: this is a very good scotch ale, it's not my favorite style but I enjoyed this one, I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the style.

Smells of caramel malt, brown sugar and almond. Taste follows nose with caramel malt and brown sugar. Alcohol is well hidden. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with good carbonation. This is a solid, tasty Scotch Ale that would I would rate higher if it had a bit more caramel malt lingering on the finish.

After a few minutes the head recedes towards the glass, with a wisp of carbonation residue settling in the middle.    Nose: Caramel sweetness, firewood, butterscotch, nutty (hazlenut/pecan). Pumpernickel bread comes through as well.    Tongue: Malty goodness, and smooth creamy toffee notes. Rummy raisins, and caramelized cherries that have been rubbed in brown sugar (that was a bit much wasn't it??). You really should let this get closer to room temperature. Many flavors unlock with warmth.     Body: Not to heavy for the style. A surprisingly effervescent and hoppy mouthfeel accompany the sweetness this beer exudes. Feels more like a 7% than 8+. A hanging woodsy taste sticks around.    Overall: A really well done beer, I'm glad this is available in cans now. You would be hard pressed to find a better scotch style ale at a cheaper price. *I got a 12 pack for $18 in Jersey*. I recommend this indubitably.

There is certainly some phenol alchohol / scotch / booze flavor in it, but nothing astringenI or "hot". Feel is just a little sticky but coats nicely.m

A top this dark beer is a khaki colored, foamy head, which leaves behind light signs of lacing. Aroma is a mix of malts, toffee, and raisins. Taste opens up with sweet malts, raisins, and toffee before fading with a slight dark cherry taste. Mouth feel is sublime. It opens up nicely, but feels smooth the whole time.

A slight hint of smoke that rounds into a sweet smell.    Taste- Malty, and Creamy with just the right amount of hops to keep your mouth jumping and the alcohal content high at %8.5, (meanwhile) not as bitter as most IPA's.

Definitely not overly expensive as I was able to pick up a 6-Pack for $9.99 at my local store. At %8.5 it is an affordable/high quality tasting beer with a great kick. In other words, Enjoy!

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Clear brown colored ale with a small brown colored head that doesn't last.    Quite aromatic. Toffee and molasses with caramel and faint smoke. Scent of sage and licorice with a fair scent of pepper in the ethanol fumes.    Starts out malty and sweet with smoke and caramel being the strongest flavors. Melon flavor and a little alcohol sting. Taste of chocolate and coconut. Taste of oak and a green spice flavor that is closest to Cardamom. Trace of smoke but really it is just an accent.    Mouthfeel is full.    Overall a very tasty beer and a good example of the style.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Some years back I had this in a Founders variety case. A friend and I, being somewhat new to the craft scene would try a couple of new beers every Saturday after work. We loved the other three (Centennial, Red's Rye and the Porter) but after this one I made the comment "three out of four ain't bad." He suggested that we wait a week and try it again. After my second one I made the comment, "I don't like it but I think I'm just not there yet." That left two beers out of the six pack. Less than a week later I had my third and I would compare it to a kid getting over his fear of marijuana. I was hooked. Yesterday I purchased a case of cans in Pittsburg and I'll give you one guess what's got me running my mouth right now. This is a fabulous Scotch Style American Ale.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A very complex flavor. SO balanced. A nice malty flavor on the front end that is beautifully balanced with some bite from hops. Some smoky flavor can be detected as well. Right at the end you get a hint of scotch-like flavor at the end. This beer ROCKS

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Poured aggressively into my Bruery snifter, it has a full inch-and-a-half of head that dissipates slowly and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The smell is as malty as you would expect, but it also has some citrusy and peppery notes that I'm having trouble naming specifically. The taste has some of the malty sweetness I'd expect from a scotch ale, but it's surprisingly bitter on the finish. A little harsh even. It has more personality than the average scotch ale. It's fairly smooth but just a bit on the thin side. I wish I still had a bottle of Backwoods Bastard so I could do a side-by-side comparison. Where BB was cloyingly sweet and tooth-coatingly sugary, DB is bitey and aggressive. They're both interesting and enjoyable in their own ways, but I think the perfect scotch ale would be somewhere in the middle.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Dirty Bastard pours a dark deep brown color, with a small but lacing head. Aroma is earthy, oak notes and finishes very sharp. Flavor has some earth and oak, taste slightly boozy, with a sharp aftertaste. Nice flavors, good body. Overall, sharp beer that is good to sip.
