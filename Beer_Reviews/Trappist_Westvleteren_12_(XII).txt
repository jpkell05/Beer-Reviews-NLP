Has the requisite Belgian yeast foamy head with lots of carbonation in the form of microscopic bubbles. A bit too carbonated & foamy for me, but a few quick swirls of the glass fixes that. Definitely a big beer, it is amazing this beer is made with only 4 ingredients. Lots of dried fruits, molasses, a bit boozy. Great brew.  Thanks to Chad for sharing!    1/10/15  Bottle  5 rating

Bern with all my heart. It’s less forthcoming, feels more like beer and is simply phenomenal. That being said it’s not light years better, but is marginally better. I would argue that it is a fundamentally different beer.

Very gentle pour produces three fingers of beautiful, thick pale tan head that retains and laces excellently. The canonical dark Belgian beer appearance  S -- Brown bread, fig, prune, raisin, molasses, caramelized brown sugar, toffee, hard candy  T -- Lovely semi-sweet toasty malt notes dominate the palate, alongside sugar-coated dried dark fruit, a very light herbal hoppiness, and gently fruity yeast esters   O -- Glad to finally be getting my hands on a few bottles of this while attending a conference in Brussels. This is a true masterpiece and is noticeably better than Rochefort or Saint Bernardus, imo. Didn't pick up from the brewery, but from the store it was quite pricey ($15/bottle), so I feel that I have to lower the overall some to account for that    94/100

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 A 330ml bottle with a cap date (bottled +3 years) of 1st September 2019. Poured into a Chimay goblet glass.    Appearance: After a careful pour to leave most of the yeast in the bottle, a clear brown colour with a copper red hue and a just over one finger off white head that had great retention, but eventually settled to a very nice self replenishing cap while leaving great lacing around the glass.    Aroma: Strong fruitiness, apple, plum, dates, fig, toffee with light clove and banana notes.    Taste: Sweet, plum, dates, fig, banana bread, toffee, yeast and a touch of spice.    Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium to full bodied, with moderate carbonation.    Overall: I’m not a huge fan of sweetness, and this definitely leans on the sweet side, perhaps overly so for me. I prefer both Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt 12 over this. It’s still good, and not by any means bad, but if I had to pick a special Westvleteren beer, it would definitely be a fresh bottle of the Westvleteren Blond, as that is just one of the best Belgian Pale Ale’s ever.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 I purchased this Westy 12 bottle in Barcelona in 2015, and sat on it until now, so it's at least three years old.    The appearance is dark, with a real gusher of a tan head. The aroma and the taste have a lot of cocoa, which surprised me. There also dark fruits, of course. The beer is sweet, but not overly so. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and luscious. Overall, I'm really impressed. I usually approach highly rated beers with a heavy dose of "don't believe the hype" skepticism, but Westy 12 is the real deal.    We had this side by side with Rochefort 10 (three of us doing the tasting), and we all agreed that Westy 12 was substantially better. I'd be happy to do this test over again, just to be sure, and for science, of course.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Poured into a Westvleteren goblet    A - a merky copper/red/brown with a one finger khaki head that sticks around.    S - Banana, lots of booze, very sweet malts with a very nice earthy bitter tone    T - banana bread, sweet liqueur, slightly bitter terroir. Chewy grain and hop.     M - full body, well balanced, simple yet complex, medium plus carbonation, medium acidity and such an amazing banana bread booze finish that lasts and lasts    D/O - this is one of the best beers of all time. The way the simplicity is also very complex and has so much flavor and depth. You just want more and more after every sip. The banana and booze come together in the best way possible. Just wow, I could drink think endlessly.     Final thoughts - about $10 a bottle and worth every darn penny! The ABV says 10.2, I would go as far as to say I would choose this as the only beer I’d drink if I had a choice.   
look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Brewed in January 2012, enjoyed in September 2018. 6 years old bottle :  Enjoyed for a special occasion, this beer really doesn't disappoint. This quadrupel shows a very dark body with a small head.   Great aroma with dates, cocoa, figs, toffee  The taste follows with an amazing balance at all time and an incredible drinkability.   Amaingly smooth, this dry to semi-dry ale shows no residual sugar which would make it a bit cloying.     Overall, this is an incredible beer. Really amazing. This is a quadrupel but almost on old ale territory. Reminds me more of Pannepot than St Bernardus Abt 12or Rochefort 10. Great great great

I feel ABT12 is a bit better and has more of a dynamic flavor as the it warms.   Worth a try though!

Does not taste much different than Rochefort 10 and still I'd rather have a Blue Chimmay.    The pour is a murky caramel brown with flavors of brown sugar, dates, figs, caramel, chocolate, and spice. If you know to go to Au Bron Vieux Temps in Brussels this beer is not that rare. It is super smooth for 10% but so much better brews in today's world yet glad to have gotten to finally try it. Good for what it is but would never pay more than $8 for a second round.

Noticeable alcohol, and the faintest scent of something resembling soy sauce.    Largely opaque caramel colour, deep ruddy brown, luxurious lacing and a fantastic and persistent white head. Looks almost perfect for what I'd expect from a beer like this one, honestly.    Ample carbonation, sharp but not harsh bitterness, complex assortment of flavours -- starting out spicy, then noticeably bitter (without much if any hop flavour), lightly phenolic, drying finish with caramel-like/slight toffee aftertaste.    It's like eating a warm piece of well-spiced, bready fruitcake with a little caramel sauce -- and taking a quick sip of clovey wheat beer afterwards.     Definitely one of the best Belgian strong ales I've had. For me, definitely not the "best beer in the world" (which seems a meaningless statement anyway), but I'd say it's one of the best brews made in Belgium for sure.    (For my money, the Westvleteren blonde (6?) is outstanding, if I had to choose between them, I'd take a fresh bottle of that in a flat second. The 8 is not very interesting compared to either, in my opinion.)   
look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 So after ordering this from the Monks by email, I waited a long time for it to be shipped to the states. It was worth the wait, but obviously an extravagance that most can not afford. Simply put abt $20 a 12 oz bottle is steep. That said, it was totally worth it an one of the most complex beers I have ever had. I did a side by side with two other Belgium styles Rochefort 10 and Jeffe. After doing so, I can say that West’s was the best with Rochefort 10 very close behind. With Rochefort being 40% cheaper and more readily available, I can recommend that as well. Should you be in a position to order some westy, do so. Make sure you only share with people who truly appreciate beer. If a persons favorite beer is a mass marketer beer, leave them out because they will ruin your experience. Also, there is nothing bad about keeping them all to yourself. After all, you’ve certainly earned it.

Yeah it's just a really nice Belgian quad, but its rarity boosts the score for many. Great deep caramel malts and fruit sugars. Excellent.     I can't say for sure that there's no better beer in the world but this one is certainly up there.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Finally got my hands on this legendary Trappist beer. Cap reads “Trappist Westvleteren 12, bevat / bier, gerstemout 10,2% VOL, ABDIJ ST. SIXTUS 8640 WESTVLETEREN TENMINSTE HOUDBAAR TOT : ZIE TOP 33Cl e”. Date on cap is 06.04.19.    This beer pours a beautiful burnt sienna brown, completely opaque with some noticeable sediment and continually rising carb. The head bubbles away quickly, beginning around two fingers and settling at one finger of ivory foam.    The nose is bursting with vibrant aromas of caramel, subtle molasses, and a wonderful combination of spices . Dark fruits are all over the backbone of this beer, full of dates and raisins.    Bready, fruity, caramel, and dark fruits all balance the amazing flavors in this beer. A subtle spiciness rings true throughout; I pick out anise in particular. More of those dates and raisins settle on the tongue. A boozy warmth is felt all the way down, paving the way for that undoubtedly certain next sip.    A great weight to this beer. Full mouthfeel, with a high carb that hits sharply but not unpleasantly. Slight stickiness, great warmth.

Quite delicate smell, but very pleasant.     Taste is delicious! Certainly get some toffee malts, raisin and a little sugar. Extremely well balanced, an absolutely incredible smooth beer.     The feel is thick and creamy, which goes wonderfully with the beer. A real Belgian gem!

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Pours a dark brown with a bit of murkiness to it. Head formation is high, fluffy, and retains exceptionally well. There is a bit of dark, grainy particles that linger at the bottom of the cup after leaving what looks like a little patch of dirt on the head. Lacing is dense enough that it looks like chocolate milk layered on the glass. Aroma is dark and rich plum, clove, and yeast. There is a teasing kiss of toffee and caramel on the nose as well. Flavor profile is rich and decadent plum, raisin, cloves, yeast, and biscuit and toffee malts. Toffee, and caramel add a bit more depth to it. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a velvety, smooth, and creamy feel. Overall, a magnificent brew. There is still a finger of khaki foam sitting a top even after this review. Aroma is maybe a touch thin when comparing with the rest of the beer, but the flavor profile carries a lot of depth while remaining balanced.     Served in a Chimay chalice from a 11.2oz bottle.

I was living in Germany and was headed to the Brugges beer fest and wanted this unicorn beer, I had to make 85 phone calls to the Abby to reserve a time slot and only 2 racks per car. Luckily our slot was available on the drive back. I think we paid 45 Euros per rack (24 bottles and cool wooden rack) with a promise to save some for a friend that met us at Brugges. He never got any, sorry bro.    Anyhow, about a year later, my buddy was headed downrange and stopped off at the local base liquor store which had a very small lot of this beer, priced at $450 a case!! The unicorn beer is good, hell, great when you can only buy it at a small Abby in Belgium (they have a pub across the street where its on tap) but St. Bernardus Abt 12 is almost its clone and attainable.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Note: This is a bottle that I have been storing for more than three years since it go out of date. Light brown reddish colour, small head with very short retention. No lace. Aroma of dates, raisins, brandy, spices, wood, some chocolate, spices Medium to full body, creamy alcoholic palate, flat carbonation. Sweet fruity finish. Taste of dried fruits: prundes, raisins, dates, chocolate, spices, pepper, fruits, wood. Exceptional, one of te best, like his sister 8.

I love the Trappist style ales but living where I do the style is hard enough to find let alone true Abby produced ales.     We recently traveled to Europe and added a few days before our river cruise to visit Poperinge Belgium, yes that mystical place that is close to the St. Sixtus Abby. We actually went there to visit the St. Bernardus brewery in nearby Watou.     The kind lady at the hotel desk was aware we were beer geeks and asked if we had tried the Westvleteren 12 and we said no, she got with the hotel owner who arrainged for us to visit a cafe and try some.    Westvleteren 12 is what all Belgian Quads try to be. You have to enjoy the style to really appreciate this beer. It has all the aromas and flavors you would expect in an Abby ale, but it's subtler in the balance than a lot of them. Poured from a bottle into traditional glass wear complete with the St. Sixtus branding it hard a tight carmel colored head. Taste had notes of fruits, spices, and sweetness. Aroma carried the same notes as the taste. Mouth feel was silky smooth. The monks have mastery of the art of making high gravity beers that do not taste like high gravity beers.     Okay I will freely admit that the overall experience may color my review of this beer but picture this scene before you judge me too harshly. We were seated at an outdoor table in a small Belgian town, our waiter brings two bottle of this nearly un-obtainable beer to us and is laughing to himself. We asked why he was laughing and he tells us as he is passing behind the bar with our beers another patron calls a friend to tell him the bar has the Trappist for sale and he stopped to tell him "no we don't". We were just finishing the first bottle as he brought us a second. Total cost for us to each enjoy two of the worlds most exclusive beers was 10 Euros.     Best beer in the world, maybe or maybe not depending on your taste. Have I ever enjoyed a beer as much as that day? No I have not!

A: Huge fizzy slightly off white khaki color that makes the beer almost hard to pour, but it settles almost as quickly as it forms. Brackish brown black body with very little light escaping its murkiness.    S: Light bits of dates, figs, and clove, but also a floral hop presence like noble hops. There is a nice doughy almost banana bread like smell that permeates.     T: Lots of lovely date, fig, caramel raisin taste with a little burnt sugar and toffee.     M: Insanely biting high carbonation, but yet it finishes so smooth it's unreal.    O: This is a world class beer no doubt, but the carbonation is way too high and I was expecting the depth of flavor to be more nuanced. That being said, it is really really good.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Tea to crimson in color, massive bubbling head that almost made my cup runneth over. It retains a meringue of the khaki foam of over two fingers for a good while. This find of Westvleteren at the Yongsan seven day did make said cup overflow with joy!     Dark caramel, plum, a twinge of brandy, cherry wood.     Sweet tobacco, bourbon, toffee, dark fruit. The balance is phenomenal; rich, sweet flavors, alcohol bitterness, and booze that is more flavor than heat.     A light to medium body is accosted by waves of carbonation. I would like a little less carbonation, it would make things a little smoother, but it doesn’t really hurt.     I can’t believe I found this in the Republic of Korea. This legend is definitely the best Quad I’ve had.

Carbonation bubbles rose from the bottom of the glass for the duration of drinking it. Smell is some dark fruit, and maybe a little nutty. Nothing mind blowing but not bad either. Taste is a smooth blend of dark fruit followed by a slight sweetness and then a little dry, nutty finish. Alcohol is present but very well hidden. The feel is creamy and smooth with a very pleasant moderate viscosity, making the feel my favorite attribute of this beer. Overall a great beer, certainly worth trying once if you’re lucky enough to find it.

S - Dark fruits, plums, raisins, figs. Awesome Belgian yeast notes. Maybe a little caramel. Some level of spiciness.  T - Just like the nose. Throw in some leather too. The spicy notes were unexpected, or stronger than expected, but they were perfectly balanced as well.  M - Well carbonated, mouthfeel is just perfect.  O - Overall this was an excellent quad. That being said, it is definitely -not- worth the pain of obtaining it. Rochefort 10 and Abt 12 are within a hair's breadth of the quality of this brew (maybe better), but the latter 2 I can pick up anywhere. I would take all of these that someone would sell at retail price, but I will never pay a big premium over these 2 other superb and readily available competitors.

The tan head is pillowy, but less pronounced than other quads – maybe a finger and a half in the Rochefort (forgive me) chalice. Sat on this one for a year, so Merry Christmas to me. This contemplative time calls for casting a blog post out into the great wide sphincter of the web.    Rating this, it’s true – the hype colours my opinion, for better or worse. Having tried the Blonde, 8, and 12, the word I keep coming back to with the Westys is 'subdued'.     I'll come clean – that's pretentious English for 'not as tasty as expected'.    These are obviously complex flavours that mingle to create something unique, cohesive, and of course, oft-mimicked. But in a world where incredible brews are becoming more accessible with each passing day, these holy grails from a romanticized era of monks and secret yeasts are built to disappoint.     Still, I kept it for a year, took it from the cellar at just the precise time, took a couple of silly photos, cut a slice of Christmas pudding, and tucked in. Lo and behold, it was great! It maintains a deeper character than other quads, forgoing syrupy sweet fruits and sugars to ponder leathery fig and cherry. The spices recall cigar paper and toffee, and, of course, there is zero alcohol whatsoever.    But then, constantly on the periphery of booze and jolly times, there’s St. Bernardus – brown robed, chalice aloft. I can grab his abt. 12 from 4 or 5 different liquor stores in the area, and am yet to have a straight-up bad or tainted experience. Is the Westy really as superior as the comparative hassle of acquiring it would suggest? No, not really.    There’s also Rochefort 10 – definitely a favourite of mine. Each bottle has slight variances, but what beer doesn’t? I’m sure the Westy does, despite its deified status.     But which is better? Well, I'm no expert. Who's to say my pour or temperature control wasn't off? Maybe my tastebuds weren’t working at 100% efficiency. When I make it to Belgium, I’ll be sure to try them side by side. It’ll be fun.    Then, for all I drone on about the market being saturated with young breweries jumping in to imperial stouts and unnecessarily aged quad-wannabes, there’s something like Copperhead’s quad, Medusa. Is it superior to the originals? Well, no. But it *is* a half hour drive and 5 bucks away, and I can get it straight from the tap. Probably some nice conversation, too.     So, what's the lesson here? Well, time to go dark on hype. No more Facebook circlejerks telling me what it is the local community should like; no more avoiding things because untappd decided it’s only worth a 3.8 (I mean, Gulden Draak? Common guys!); no more hoarding bottles for the sake of hoarding.    I’ll probably get excited for the odd interesting-sounding limited release, but let’s see what’s on the doorstep before I get blueballs for the next Best Beer in the World™. Cheers, everyone! Happy New Year!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Received in a trade almost 6 years ago. 2011 Vintage from the monastery (not part of the 'brick' series).    A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice deep, rick mahogany/garnet hue with a nice thin thin off white head that fades to leave light thin blanket but a nice creamy halo. Nice lacing.    S - Aromas of dark fruits, plums, raisins, figs. Nice yeast notes, like soaked bread. Super super faint black cherry pit aroma. Nice light caramel. The belgian yeast notes are a little spicy/warming as well. Very aromatic.    T - Taste is similar to the nose, loads of dark fruit. Big raisins and plums, light fig. Lots of leather. Definitely tastes 'aged'. Great caramel and belgian yeast going on. Honestly this is just picture perfect for what I want in a Quad. Zero discernible alcohol as well.    M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, not cloy, and the alcohol is hidden very nicely.    O - Overall this was a very very well done Quad. This is drinking absolutely wonderfully right now, really happy I drank this now and was able to enjoy it but sad that it is my one and only vintage bottle. Just excellent. There's a reason why cars used to line up in droves at the monastery gates to get Westy all those years ago.    Serving Type: Bottle

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Enjoying the last of about 120 bottles I've been working my way through over the last two years. Most of the last forty bottles have a rising head as soon as I open the bottle and strong carbonation that often causes an immediate overflow and requires me to start the pour as soon as possible. There is a sense of freshness that reminds me of the freshest baguettes from the best Parisian boulangerie. At first I didn't like how carbonated it was but I quickly realized I could simply wait for the level of carbonation I felt like that day. Flavor is, for me, just a tad too bitter. At first this kept leaving me a bit disappointed. Now I love it. Head is epic. Like beaten egg whites. I almost tried shaving with it. The lacing on the sides of the glass and on the top of the beer, drunk from the classic or the more recent glasses from the brewery, is absolutely perfect. I used to photograph it because it really is gorgeous and unique. It is luxurious and generous and the bubbles are tiny holes in whipped-cream textured sheets that cling to the sides of the glass and really are a pleasure to look at as I continue. The flavor is honey, fig, nutmeg, dark fruits, berries, a bit of pineapple, dried fruits in a trail mix, fresh, rich crust from the best European bread, and a bitter undertone that must be the hops but the integration of these flavors is a marvel that provides the kind of taste odyssey that matches the experience of the finest high-end wines. From small sips savored in discrete moments or actually drinking, even gulps - I've been drawn to try consuming it in every way and each has its charms. in the layered variation that is a meditative experience I have come to value beyond any normal beer. It is a fuller experience than I can really relate in words. It occupies my attention on multiple levels in a way that has a value I can't quite articulate as a celebration or a comfort or a wake-up call that changes each time I pour one of these marvels. The texture is on the viscous side, just enough to coat my mouth with a nuanced, ever-changing percolation of flavors that take over my attention and my mouth that is better than any other beer I've ever had. It's chewy; I actually found myself chewing at it at first because it's so complete. This beer absolutely screams quality in every mouthful. The smell alone has occupied my attention through entire bottles. Actually, that's the thing about this beer - I have enjoyed bottles where I found myself focusing on the taste, or the texture, or the lacing and the head, or the lovely warming intoxication and in none of those areas, no matter how much I focused on it, did I find any level of disappointment. With many things in life, if you focus on them too much there is repetitiveness and limitation. Pick any food you thought you loved and eat it every day. Inevitably something about it eventually predominates that leaves disappointment. Not with this beer. It is more than a beer. Seriously - it is an experience in itself that concentrates my focus in a way that transports me from the normal experience of life. I would put this on the level of a trip to the best museum, the highest-level artist of whatever music you love, or the best book or movie. It really is all that. The alcohol is perfectly integrated and brings a heart-lifting warmth that penetrates the taste buds and - ok, laugh at me if you will - the soul and the heart. As I drink this last bottle, not knowing if I can manage to get any more right now, I am moved by the pure quality and the sense of integrity in every mouthful. This truly is everything I ever heard people say it was and I am finally willing to say that it is the best beer experience I have ever had, bar none.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.75 Westy 12 from bottle dated 14/3/15. Big thanks to Jason for the glasses and 2 bottles from when they were distributed to the US.    Pours a rich amber color with ample sediment. Quickly dissipating head.     Aroma is pure dark fruits: raisins and figs. Lots of toffee, brown sugar, and honey notes.    Taste is on the thicker side with a moderate amount of carbonation. Dark fruits are present but are overshadowed by ample honey note. In comparison to other Belgian beers, it's a bit thicker and less carbonated. More alcohol is present on the palate; not heat or burn.    Overall, this is a very unique beer that is almost a concentrate to its competitors. I do like it... quite a bit, but I wish it had just a little more carbonation. I paired it with a mixed cheese ball (Beverly's recipe). It gets 93/100.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 For years I've been hearing about the mythical and seemingly unattainable Westvleteren XII. As a result, its become one of those so called "whales" that, considering its scarcity and hefty price in the U.S., I would resign myself to having to travel directly to the monastery in Belgium. How ironic that on a leisurely family trip to Rome I came across it at Beerland Trillusa in Trastevere, Rome for the hefty but manageable price of 19 euros. My search was over! I sat down in the modest outdoor cafe overlooking the hip Trastevere  Neighborhood, and as I waited for my server, I pondered if it was worth the hype.  The stately plain brown bottle came out. Who needs fancy label art when this one is so elegant in its simplicity. It poured a murky mahogany brown color. An enormous tan foam head gushes up to the top in a beautifully controlled fashion. It retains seemingly for an eternity, its thick film covering the surface until the very end.  As I poured it out of the bottle onto the pint glass that was handed to me, I could immediately smell the aromas of dark bread, amber malts, caramel, dark fruit and a whiff of alcohol cutting through the air with their alluring boldness, as if to say "come hither!" So many layers throughout, its difficult to do justice to all. There was also a touch of cocoa, spices, raisin, plum and grape. Towards the end there was biscuity malt.  Going into the mouth was the highly anticipated moment for me. Some beers take a while for the flavors to develop. Not with this one. It's like all the nuances of bold and complex flavors burst forth as soon as they hit the tip of the tongue in a frenzy of instant gratification. If there is a smoother, more velvety and creamier brew out there, I haven't had it. In the mouth it feels like fluffy and soft floating clouds. Full bodied and gently carbonated, yet so drinkable that a few sips in I realized it was going down too fast. I'll discuss the flavors soon, except that I can't emphasize enough what an amazing texture, feel and drink ability this work of art of a beer is. As for the flavors, I do not know if there is another brew out there with such a complex array of flavors and that still manages to blend them so elegantly and smoothly. In the first phase there is a sweetness from amber malts, dark candi sugar, and soft tones of cocoa powder that add a smooth creaminess. This is complemented by a light alcohol spice that is just right and not boozy. Hard to decide what else to add as I'm sure I'm missing out on some flavor, but, here goes: dark fruit such as alcohol soaked raisins, plumps, red grape, and even a touch of lightly sour cherries. Vinous and with the feel of currants. Spicy and peppery but not overwhelmingly so, dark bread, and berries. What really did it for me is how in the middle phase there was the emergence of earthy, herbal grassy green hops that added a bold bitterness and dryness to the finish, unique in that I usually don't associate a strong hops profile with Belgian Ales.   As I finished I was in a state of both euphoria and sorrow. Euphoria at both the delicicious cornucopia of tastes and for the deceptively high ABV that provided no burn, and sorrow because it came to an end. Now for the dilemma of rating it. Was it worth the hype? Most definitely so, although the price and its status might have convinced me to wish it so. However, what is undeniable is that it is one of the most perfectly crafted, classy and elegant of all brews; it's like the Rolls Royce of brews. Is it the so called "world's best beer" as the sign at the bar said? Clearly a subjective and almost ridiculous concept, kind of like asking "what is the world's greatest piece of music, art or literature, however, I would find it hard to argue against it. Does it have flaws? I don't see any, which is why I will score it a perfect 5.  P.S. On the way out I picked up a bottle of Westvleteren VIII to go. Can't wait to try it!

Very interesting beer both in the taste and aroma. Doesn't seem like a quad, smells and tastes like a dunkel. It's not bad by any means, just not what I expected. Very well balanced, way easier to drink than expected for +10% ABV. Malty and interesting barnyard vibes from the yeast. I didn't taste it, but possibly some bubblegum as well.     For the price tag, I'm pretty sure this will be the last time I have this beer.

It does hint, however, at the depth and full-bodied character of the beer, which fully envelops every sip.    Overall: it's quite the hike to get out there, but it's a fun day trip made even more worth it by the beer.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Let me explain why I think it is the best on the world. First, I am a wine person. When I moved to Belgium I had never heard about the Westvleteren. I got the suggestion from a blog from someone who doesn't know beer. When I tried it I said: "My God, this is amazing", then I start to read like crazy about the beer.   That said, I went there with no expectations, it was just a weekend trip, so I could appreciate it as neutral. I believe a lot of people has high expectations and it bothers the judgement.  To say it is the best in the world is subjective, but I think it is in a class of outstanding beers, with Rochefort 10 and others that must receive a 5. Today is the best for me, tomorrow maybe I can find another one, but this will always be amazing.  The good news: I could place a call last week and tomorrow I will pickup my 2 crates, with 48 bottles at the abbeys. If I move from Belgium, I will miss it.

Smells of dark fruit dark wine and dark rum. Smooth fruity lushious wounderful flavor. Engages all the taste buds. I do not feel or taste the booze going down, but after a bit i can tell it's there. Full body but not syrupy. Easy to drink. I do think its the best of the Trappistes and like Quads. Thanks to my step son for finding this for me!

S - Raisins, plumb, fig, toasted toffee, slight rum aroma, very little alcohol in the nose.    T - Complex and flavorful with no flavor being dominant. Plumb, brown sugar, toasted toffee, figs, rum, raisin. Nice lingering rum and toasted toffee.    M - Big medium body, creamy carbonation.    O - This aged fantastically!!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Remember when I first joined here this brew sat around the top 100 list as the proverbial shit. Remember passing on it about five years ago when it came to my area with a price tag of $299.99 per six pack. Wasn't having it but I knew a guy who did. He came over tonight with the final bottle and since we were childhood friends, he thought he'd share with me. So here goes.    Looks - Poured into a goblet. Deep heavily murked brown woth a large tan head loaded to the brim with bubbles. High carbonation and no lacing surprisingly upon a finished glass.    Smell - You get all the usual quad suspect with a substantial whiff of alcohol.     Taste - Low bubblegum levels with a heavy hay like presence. Raisiny and highly alcoholic.    Feel - Surprisingly thin bodied with high carbonation. Flavors all retain and it swallows with a boozy slickness.    Overall - Glad I finally got to try it. Worth $299.99 a sixer? Hell no. This is a good beer of course but I honestly prefer Rochefort ten. More explosive flavors and the alcohol is better hidden.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Tasted alongside the St. Bernardus abt 12, which is supposedly a derivative of this beer.    L - dark brown, raisiny; creamy off-white head that dissipates quickly  S & T - raising yeasty wholewheat breaddough; toasty; rum-raisins; earthy herbally (almost like a thyme cough syrup); very 'full' flavored, more so than the St. Bernardus  F - slightly boozy, creamy, quite smooth, but with a definite cognac-y alcohol glow    O - very, very solid beer. Would definitely not call it best-beer-in-the-world though... I did prefer it over the St. Bernardus, as it is more 'full' in its flavor, like it's turnt the flavors up a few notches without going overly overboard and cranking it all the way up to 11. That said, it is more boozy than the St. Bernardus, and the St. Bernardus recipe seems to have evolved since Westvleteren withdrew the outsourcing of their recipe to make all the flavors way more sessionable and harmoniously blended, whereas this 'real deal' is more of a rollercoaster.    I do recommend this one.

I don't know if it's the best beer I have ever had even in its style but it shows what this style should strive to be. The beer pours a reddish brown with a light of white lacing of bubbles. The smell is dark fruits and caramel. The flavor starts with raisins and plums and finishes with a subtle hoppy bitterness. The feel is extremely smooth and creamy with a good amount of carbonation hiding the alcohol until the very end but even then not overpowering. Outstanding!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 From the .33l bottle, cap stamped 16.12.18. Served in a tulip.    Pours an aggressively carbonated acorn brown with a ridiculously tall and poufy head of tan foam. Looks like a root beer float. Retention is excellent and leaves fat wads of lacing sliding down the glass.    Nose of funky, fruity yeast and earthy, toasted grain.    Taste is spot-on with the smell, whole grain toast with fig preserves, cherries, caramel apple and mushroom. Earthy, tannic and funky, but lightly sweet. Finishes nutty, with a little spice and and some subtle, boozy warmth.    Feel is smooth and creamy, no more than medium bodied and lightly carbonated despite appearances. Detectable booziness is moderately low.    Overall, it's enough to make me want to be a monk.

Poured into small Teku and allowed to warm to 55ish. At $20 for the small bottle, this is the most expensive beer I've ever had.    I would say it lives up to the hype. Upon first tasting it, I thought it was as good as any Belgian quad I've had. By the end of the glass, I decided that it was slightly better than any of the others I've had. Hours later, it seems significantly better than the others. This is not to say that it is my favorite beer, as strong Belgian ales are not my favorite type, but this starts out very nice and grows on you.    Aroma is not that strong. On tasting, it has a very strong bitterness which is very well balanced by complex botanical flavors, malt flavors, and yeast flavors. It is less yeast-forward and more hoppy than other quads I've had. Balance is so good, that it is not really "forward" anything. Head is very nice upon pouring and fades to a nice lacing, for those who care about that sort of thing. It seems to me that it has more carbonation than others of its type, which may account for some intensification of the experience of drinking it. Did not notice much sediment in final pour.    There is a lot of depth to this beer, and it challenges the mind to try to appreciate all its components simultaneously.    Definitely world class. Is it the best beer in the world? There is an argument here. Belgian quads are one of the best types of beer, and this is one of the best Belgian quads.

I know a lot of people compare this to St.Bernardus 12 (as the recipes are meant to be the same) but this one is way better in my opinion.

I had a Abt 12 on this trip to Europe and the Westy 12 is in my opinion the better Quad. I need a side-by-side with Rochfort 12, but if you believe quads are the best beers then this one may be the best beer in the world not called Cantillon. 4.75    A – Pours an opaque, dark, ruby brown with a one-finger creamy head. 4.5    S - Brown sugar, light on the raisin 4.5    T – Spicy, brown sugar sweetness, not as heavy on the dark fruit as some quads. 5.0    MF - Heavy bodied but comes off as lighter than many quads that I have had. Creamy with a semi-dry finish. 4.5

What is there is the obvious dark fruits, some cream/vanilla, some alcohol. Not terribly complex.    T - silly sweet initially and finishes dry and bitter. I'm kind of at a loss. It tastes like the status quo of quads. Nothing remarkable and the bitter earthy finish is pretty off putting.    M - heavily, heavily carbonated, fizzy and dry.    O - meh. The hype train strikes again  St.b12 is definitely much better imo. Never like Roch 10 much though so maybe I'm just an outlier.

Definitely worth the hype but also definitely not worth waiting in long lines or paying extravagant fees to obtain. Once you get one you can expect notes of carmelized sugars, raisins, dark fruits like figs in the nose. Tastes sweet with candied sugar, raisins, figs, prunes, slight molasses, and just great all around taste. Definitely in the heavier side but easily digestible. A great beer all around. Don't pay top dollar. Be patient and it will come to you at some point, beer geeks!!!!

The key to appreciating the flavor profile in this beer is to drink it warmer.  I started out at a slightly colder temp, but warmer temps brought depth and complexity.    The most complex and balanced Quad I have tasted. Apple, sweet, and pear in the aroma which broadens with warming.    Very malt forward mouth feel.     The taste gets a bit dwarfed by the sharp bitter finish, but the apple and pear transition well from the taste. What amazes me about this beer is that it totally changes with warming- the flavors become increasingly complex.    It's worth checking out. Perhaps not as full and rich as other Belgian quads, nor over the top, but the increased complexity with warming and balance is a winner.

That being said, this is my favorite Quad of all that I've had. Others who say that this is "the quintessential" quad are right. This hits all the right notes that a quad should, but in a slightly subdued manner. The yeast is there, but doesn't overwhelm. The sweetness is also there, but is kept in check. And the beer is smooth as hell to boot.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Absolutely worth the hype and expense, the Westvleteren XII is the best beer you will ever have in the world! This beer actually tastes better as it ages....I have had a 2017 and a 2015, and the older the better. Dark, complex, malty and both spicy and fruity, with a thick milkshake texture. This is the perfect winter beer, however it is not available for purchase in local stores in Belgium. You can find it at northern Belgium restaurants for 10-15 euro per Bottle. I skip the high markups and go directly to the Westvleteren Sint Sixtus Abbey where you can get a case every 6 months for 42 euro (by reservation only) and they register your license, plus you agree NOT to re-sell to a 3rd party...Yes, it is that special!

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Dark opaque maroon with a soft tan blanket that retains a bit thinner throughout.    The smell on this is unbelievably complex. Toasted wheat or pumpernickel bread, with a spice bouquet featuring minimal notes of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg--these spices are only present enough to be a delight, and are not potent at all. Then comes caramelized, softened apples, brown sugar, baked graham cracker crust, amaretto, and pear. Wow!    Taste is toasted bread and roasted nuts, grape, and plum. There is something deep and savory in there, but it's brightened by a hint of spice and fruit, with faint raisin.    Medium to full bodied, with a good amount of carbonation, finishing relatively middle range, leaning semi-dry.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Found at a bottle shop/bar, 2012 imported bottle to the US.  Look: very very think sediments in the glass, dark ruby red color.    Aroma: roasted chocolate, figs, dates, bread, Belgian yeast.    Taste: similar to aroma, roasted chocolate, dried figs and dates, excellent Belgian yeast, little carbonation but that may be due to the age, alcohol and carbonation dances on the toung.    I can definitely see the hype around this beer. It is unlike anything I have ever tasted. I love the roasted taste, it truly is the best beer in the world. It's worth the expense and honestly it's cheaper than barrel aged American beer.

Smells of fig clove, champagne, banana, and sweet sticky buns. Taste follows with a hint of alcohol presence to cap it off. Feel is smooth, somewhat light, well carbonated with a big alcohol warmth especially as it warmed. Overall, it doesn't get much better than this for a Belgian quad. Cheers!

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 To honor NASA discovering the TRAPPIST-1 star system, I'm finally breaking open the bottle I got at the local shop last year. I have to say, everything about this beer is a surprise, from the texture to the flavor. It pours clear dark brown with receding head, no lacing, and clumps of heavy sediment towards the end of the pour.     Smell is sweet toffee candy, red apples, dark cherries, cola; sweet and interesting. Taste is where it gets really weird though. Starts off quite sweet, but gets shockingly bitter and dry by the end. Burnt toffee and spice dominate the front end, with fairly strong alcoholic roughness and clove-like numbing feeling on the tongue. This is one that must be sipped slowly or palate fatigue will do you in, and fast. A strange Dr. Pepper-like medicinality threatens to make this one cloyingly sweet, but then a bitterness sets in and all of a sudden, you're dealing with burnt malts, dry, strong boozy flavors that give the lingering finish more of a sharp, acidic, spicy yeast quality than a sweet, rounder one. I can't say this is a particularly balanced beer, and nor does it want to be. It hits hard and strong in each direction it pulls.    The strangest thing about this beer is the carbonation, which, with it's disappearing head, is between soda and champagne, and less like beer. It certainly brings up those belches! Overall, I can't say this lives up to the hype of former "best beer ever, anywhere." It just doesn't quite complement itself well in the flavors it most strongly forces. That said, every sip was interesting, pleasurable, and I don't regret the slightly exorbitant price I paid to get it locally. It may not be my favorite, but it's deserving of it's place as a legend.

In all regards this is one of the best beers in the world and has well lived up to the hype each time. I will preface this review by saying that it is based off of memory. Also, I have given a bottle of this beer to my boss and to my (at that time future) father-in-law, both met with excellent results. While this beer certainly lives up to its lofty expectations, I I'll be the first to admit that part of the joy with this beer is tracking it down. The fist time I came across it was in a tiny beer store in Bruges. These were well aged bottles to say the least (4+ years old). The mouthfeel and taste of this batch was sublime. this was by far the smoothest beer I have had at any abv, while still maintaining the look, smell and taste. The second and third time I had the honor to try this beer were while in Brussels. Acquired at a well known beer store just off the grand place. Again the beer was amazing. While not as aged as the fist, all aspects of his beer were top notch.

It is generally a very expensive beer to buy, probably because it is held in such mighty regard, and being a bit on the tight side I had let it slip passed me a few times! Bad Bujon! Call yourself a man of Beer!!  So the review, well I have to say it is all round a very good brew, but it didn't blow me away, in the same way as a few of the Belgian Christmas Beers do. A rich dark colour, with a caramel head, and a malty fruit bread type of after taste. In all honesty it seems to lack a bit of guts, but none the less it is certainly up there, and requires sampling at your first opportunity.   Would I spend 16 euro on it again? Not when there are another 2000 Belgian Beers I haven't tried.  Is it the Best Belgian Beer? Very Debatable.

Rich dark fruit and dark cherries paired with old leather and mild pipe tobacco. Prunes, raisins, figs, and aged Belgian yeast ripened blended together with a hint of dusty cobwebs to add depth and character. The mouth feel is light and airy, not what I was expecting from a big quad. The carbonation was vibrant and prickly at points. The mouth feel was not as nice as the flavor for me, but this is outstanding and a must try beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Undoubtedly a great beer, but do your best to lower your expectations going in because its reputation is so sky-high, it'd be hard for any beer to live up to the hype. For me it improved massively with age, developing a nice rummy note 6 months to a year in. Soft dark caramel/muscovado sugar, raisins, figs with a slight cedar-y quality and a bit of a spicy/bublegummy prickle from the yeast, but still a very smooth finish.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Pours hazy, dark brown in color with 1/2 inch head. The head simmers down to a beautiful thin frothy top. Amazing looking beer. Taste is raisin, fig, dark bread, plum, red apple skin, and light alcohol. Multi-layered, malty, medium heavy bodied, and sweet. Cannot get over the complexity and the smoothness. One of the best Belgian beers I have had. A treat to myself. I will get this again.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 L:gives a hazy dark reddish color. A good creamy top of head when I pour, sticky lacings on the glass.     S: brown sugar, dark fruits especially plums, cherries, spices like peppercorn,cardamom and cloves,caramel and chocolate.    T&F: starts of with delicious dark fruits and brown sugar,with the malt caracters in the background. I sense both plums,figues, caramel and a hint of what feels like chocolate.in the middle I get a more sour flavour that reminds more of cherries with different spices,the finish is dry and bitter but in the background I sense very sweet flavour, the aftertaste are one of the longest I encountered. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth in every aspect,and I already in the first sip get a warm feeling in my body. This beer is great balanced in all aspect,and all the flavours I encounter are amazing     O: this is a amazing beer and it is impressive in every aspect. Maybe is hyped up to much, I don't know. Is other belgian quads that are close to this. Anyway it was a pure pleasure to trie this and I enjoyed every drop of it.

I've had this by itself, and compared it next to St. Bernardus ABT 12 and Rochefort 12. Comparatively, the Westy 12 has the best balance of flavors, mouth feel/carbonation, and finish.     Pours deep and dark like a true quad should. Head is fluffy like whip cream.     The flavors are bold yet subtle and evenly spread, not one overpowering the other. Berries, cacao, earthy, subtle on the nose.    The carbonation is delightfully effervescent and energetic...electric in some bottles, which shock the eardrums.     The finish is relaxing and pleasing, of a mild dark chocolate, the best finish of any Belgian. I found St. Bernardus ABT to come in at #2 -- flavor profile is slightly more minerally and metallic. Rochefort 12 was #3 in the lineup -- the chocolate dipped berry boldness is a bit overpowering for my liking, and always has been. I continue to drink and enjoy it, but it's still my #3.

Possibly the best aspect of this beer, silky smooth, a mouthfeel ive never experienced in any other quad.    O- hard to live up to the immense hype, but it comes close.

Great retention; gorgeous lacing. (4.75)	    S:	  Aromas of musty old barnwood and cherries with a slightly tart twang that is barely perceptible. (4.25)	    T:	  Waves of smooth earthy, rich, brown bread and workbench dirt, dripping in dark fruit character with a touch of bubblegum and caramelized sugar in the finish. (4.5)	    M:	  Medium+ bodied with active (but soft) carbonation, puffy, fluffy feel, drinkable. (4.75)	    O:	  Wow.   This is a very nice, very flavorful, very enjoyable beer. I am a big fan of Belgians and that is one that I've always wanted to get ahold of. I'm glad I did (merci, Steve). A unified sensory experience that highlights the incredible nature of brewing. Walks a line between big and drinkable, sweet and earthy, rich and refreshing. This is a world-class beer. Have it if you ever see it! (4.75)

Definitely dominated by plum, though. Never had a quad with so much plum. Drank side by side one from Belgium, one of the American releases and rotchefort 10. The one not imported (straight from Belgium) was better than the American distributed box one. Both blew rotchefort 10 out of the water.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Sight: Pours dark brown, almost chocolatey, with a slight reddish hue. Beautuful, thick head, is creamy, off-white and variable in size.    Smell: dark fruits esters with mild pleasant phenols. Dark bread, and something prickly like dr. Pepper.     Taste: I think cherry cola would not be far off. There's also rum soaked currants, and prunes, and dates. fruity chocolate notes, with bright berries. Rye bread dough. Pepper. Subtle sweetness, decadent, but somehow still feeling off dry. Cookie dough? Omg this is good. The complexity is pretty mind blowing. The finish is absurdly long and unfolds like a symphony of sensations. Literally 20 minutes and still picking up nuances from residuals.    Feel: prickly carbonation is lively on the tongue giving a fine texture that is almost champagne like. body is medium but sturdy and chewy. Downright doughy. So.etimes feels like I'm drinking a cup of Mexican hot chocolate!    Mind: transcendental? Yeah. I think that term applies. To all those that think good beer has to be a hop bomb, take note. Is this the best beer in the world? Hard to say, but it very well could be.    Is this the same as Saint Bernards ABT 12? And how does it compare to Rochester or Westmalle? I did a side by side comparison and can tell you they are most certainly NOT the same. Of the bunch, Saint Bernardus ABT 12 is the most similar to the Westy 12--quite a bit similar, but not at all the same. The Westy is more balanced, drier, with a good deal more subtle complexity and a heftier bready quality. All the others are excellent Belgian quads, but there is a reason they are all being compared to Westy 12, because this is the Belgian beer to which all Belgian beers must be compared. It is the standard to meet and the yard stick against which all others must be judged.

Prominent caramel on the nose, with cinnamon, plum, raisins, and toffee. Huge tastes with the aforementioned fruit, cloaked in a spiciness and leathery funk. Really nicely balanced with everything playing well together.Medium to high carbonation and a dry finish. Would love to try newer bottles and compare.

A fizzy khaki head forms then fades to wisps on top and leaves faint spots of lace. The smell is of caramel, toffee, booze, raisins and figs. The taste follows with caramel covered raisin and a hint of alcohol. Full texture. Classic and world class.

The beer did not disappoint. Fast forward a few years when I visited Brussels, I found more of this heavenly beer and brought back a few bottles for a friend. I currently have seven sitting in a cool, dry place.    L - very dark, molasses, with thick head which lingers  S - fruity/fig, sugary  T - perfect blend of fruits and sugar, complexity changes as the beer finishes  F - very smooth, not overpowering    This really is one of the best beers I've had—it blends sweetness and acidity/carbonation quite well. Roche10 is often compared with this beer, which is more of a compliment to Roche10 than a knock to Westy XII. Although Roche10 comes very close, Westy XII is still the king of the Trappists; Roche10 seems slightly more carbonated, slightly overpowering the blend of sweetness compared to Westy XII. If you can find Westy XII—especially in Brussels—reward yourself, but I would never pass on a Roche10, especially given the differences in price (Westy XII was €12).

Look is a dark hazy brown with an inch head that holds up well.    Aroma is dried fruit fig raisin earthy dryness at the end.    Taste has some of that dried fruit from the aroma lots of Belgian yeast esters and a smooth dryness at the end.    Absolutely wonderful balanced beer. 10% just shines through a bit as a nice balance to the intense Belgian notes. Absolutely worth the hype. Glad I picked up a couple of bottles.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Got on trade. 330ml bottle served at 8deg C in a chalice.     A- Opens well and pours a 1" high light brown head that lasts for nearly 4mins before film out. Dark brown colour and unfiltered    S- Molasses, fig, caramel    T- Complex. A lot of flavors as expected from a quad. Sweet. Changes as it lingers on the tongue. Very Roche10 like or should I say the other way around?    M- Creamy going down then dries out    O- Nice beer. Not great and severely overrated. Not worth some $15/20/bottle by a long shot. Will not try again. Better off with Roche10's at $4/ea and you get 90+% of this beer.     Food Pairing    This rather good quad went well with...... Roasted lamb leg.    Enjoy

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Appearance: ruby brownish with a big head of tiny bubbles. Creamy head that stays for a long time with great lacing.    Aroma: I let it warm and it smelled really sweet and boozy, mainly caramel and brown sugar with a slight red wine aroma but besides that, didn't get much dark fruits smell.     Taste: caramel and toffee, I'd say really sweet and spicy, not fruity at all, maybe a bit of that red wine character.    Mouthfeel: the best of this beer IMO. Despite being so sweet, the mouthfeel was like expansive and spot on, taking that sweetness apart and letting some hoppy flavours develop.    Overall: Well, another praised beer that I think it's very good but not the "holy grail". I prefer Rochefort 10 over this, a lot more -that should get much more praise than this. That one is much fruity and pleasant. This Westvleteren seemed to be one-dimensional and it's 5 times more expensive.

Popped the cap and immediately got a smell of greatness. The pour was slow, and still ended up with 2 inches of head. Lots of sediment. Smell is so sweet - deeper and stronger than other Quads that I have had. Dark fruit is dominant. Taste is so smooth. Lots of cherries, blackberries, toffee, and hint of bitterness. Incredible. By far my favorite quad so far.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby-tinted brown coloring with a foamy, clingy, bubbly, off-white head. Aromas of rich toffee and date forward, with highlights of molasses, apple, caramel, fig, plum, subtle dark grapes, and earthy overtones. Very rich and layered aromas. Flavors are a richly sweet blend of old world fruit forward, sticky sweet with fig, date, plum, raisins, and followed with notes of apple, caramel, toffee, molasses, and earthy notes, as well as a solid boozy kick, and some subtle earthy notes. Extremely layered and dynamic flavor profiles, rich and earthy throughout, on a chewy, rich body. There is an edge from the carbonation that helps to lighten up this beast of a beer, but only slightly. The aftertaste is a blend of all the rich old world and stone fruits, with a solid booze warmth building. Slow, rich, lingering finish, with notes of molasses, date, and fig loitering on your taste buds. What a tremendous beer!

Maybe not the ’best in the world’ (it’s impossible to say with so many great beers out there), but really great to find something so interesting. Good appearance, really large head that adds to the flavour of the first few sips. The toasted caramel flavour is really nice. I bought a few more bottles to age as well, that should be fun.

Pours clear deep ruby red/brownish color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, light red grape, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, light leather, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, light red grape, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, light leather, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Moderate peppery yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible compelxity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from yeast spiciness as well. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and lightly crisp/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is amazing. Alcohol is very well hidden with a only a light warmth present after the finish. Overall this is an insane quadrupel style. All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. Very similar to Abt 12; but this one had more nutty/biscuity malt complexity and a better mouthfeel. A highly amazing offering all around, as I had hoped for.

This is a fantastic beer but can never live up to the hype. Looked the part, smelled the part. Mouthfeel was great. But flavor left me wanting more. Paid $34.99 and it was worth it for the experience. .....Once....Prefer Rochefort 10 by quite a lot. Better than St Bernadus. .maybe.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 I love this beer. i drive to the brewery/monastery every chance I get to drink and pick up a few. Unfortunately that's like once a year or two. Last time I was there I was talking with an older gentleman who said he lived close by. As we were talking, a large fly dove into his 12. He calmly took the fly out with a spoon, let it dry on the table, and continued to enjoy the beer --- "Can't let it go to waste." Even the fly eventually shook itself off and flew away...    This beer is hard to get. You can get it only at the monastery, and even then you have to make reservations ahead of time. But even if you don't have a reservation, go by and have some at the cafe next to the monastery. If you're lucky, you can pick up a gift pack with a few bottles of 12 or sometimes even a six pack in the small shop.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Sometimes it is better to find without looking.   Because you guys snap up this quad, I never expected to taste it.  Listed on the "1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die," this was one I never expected to Have. So imagine my surprise in Stockholm when I got lucky in a Belgian bar (Belgobarren) and they served it with chocolate.  Quite possibly the most analyzed ale in the world, I will say just two things.  First, it reminded me a lot of Orval in its medicinal aftertaste (medicine is good for you and, done correctly, "medicinal" is a good taste.)  Second, MJ's "Great Beers of Belgium" devotes 4 pages to Westvleleteren and is a must-read for any devotee to this brewery. MJ's 1999 "guide" gave this 4 of 4 stars back when 12 was called the "Yellow" .... and, guys, he kept it to one line: "mahogany in color, creamy, gingery and toffeeish." We can learn from that.    As for the price, it was not worth the arm and leg I paid. So, I am one and done looking for 12... but glad that it found me.

Great complexity in the flavors, excellent mouthfeel and the booze isn't overwhelming. If you have the means to acquire this, it should be experienced by all beer fans. Highly recommended.

It's incredibly complex and fires on all cylinders. I think recent reviews have purposely downplayed the beer due to it's previous publicity as "the best beer in the world." It's a fantastic beer...a rare beer. Worthy of the title of the world's best.

Worldclass beer, you should taste it at least once. Cheers.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 I had this beer as part of a Trappist tasting that my friends and I had been putting together for a while. Obviously, the guy who brought the Westy 12 didn't have to bring anything else. We started with it, and split a bottle 4 ways, into traditional chalice type glass. It's a gorgeous dark dark plum-brown, with a nice little head (pouring left something to be desired, but that's on us). It smells like you'd expect and hope a quad to smell, and the same holds true for taste and feel. It wasn't too sweet, wasn't too boozy (considering it's over 10%). I didn't let it sit on my tongue for too long, but it was incredibly smooth drinking. Will head to Belgium soon to buy some more.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Had it in Belgium summer 2015. It was the classic example but actually preferred the Westvleteren 8 better. I realize this is a quad but was just too thick, like it was going in too many directions.  Would I drink it again? Of course. Will I pay the $60 my LBS wants for a bottle? He'll no.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I'm not a big fan of Trappiste beers I must admit. I love ones with a hint of acidity like Karmeliet, or complex ones like Rochefort 12. So I wasn't expecting that much. After all, the best beer in the world title came from a lot of hype and rarity.     On the smell, it's shocking how it smells exactly like a doppelbock. Cloves, caramel, banana. Nothing similar to a trappiste. I'm missing the dark fruit notes from a Rochefort for example. On the taste, it's disappointing. It's like an amped up Chimay (so too sweet for me), but it doesn't surprise. My friends who like Trappiste beers absolutely loved it, but the lack of surprise and the sweetness disappointed me. Rochefort manages to stay on a drier note and is complex, interesting. This one is more like a british beer, meaning it's balanced and simple. Because it's rare, online bottleshops sells this 10 € for the 33 cl. But a case is around 40 € at the Abbey, so less than 2 € a beer... It's not more expensive than other trappiste beers (less, even). I think the monks know they do a good beer, but they don't believe it's better than what the other abbeys do. And this is to me absolutely true.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Found in Bruges, drank these with dad in Brussels in Westvleteren glasses. Pours a rich walnut color with an off-white head- sizable at first and present the whole way down- about half a cm for a while, then lacing. Smell is mild, yeast, a little sweetness, a little alcohol, a tiny bit of phenolic funk lurking way in the background. Taste is assertive up front- dark fruit, raisins, wood, deep and complex, boozy warmth. And although the taste is assertive, as I said, the flavor blends in a perfect way so that it almost has a mellow pleasantness. Mouthfeel is creamy and full-bodied and highly carbonated- really great. Overall what is there to say- the beer is flawless and I'm only taking a quarter point off smell because I wish it less subtle. Amazing.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Poured 330ml bottle into chalice. It is a deep, dark amber brown in color with a thick 2 finger khaki head remains for the entire session and leaves webs of lacing on my glass. The aroma is fantastic with brown sugar, bread, sweet dark fruits with some yeast and toffee and nice spices. Flavor is very full with abundant candied plums, raisins, and figs. Very bready with some brown sugar, toffee. There is a nice yeast and spice on the finish. The body is soft and sublime, medium feel with bubbly carbonation. This is certainly the best Quad I have ever enjoyed!

Westvleteren XII is, until this date, my white wale. Since my first days here in BA, Westy 12 has been my first moonshot, my only European moon shot that comes today to an end.    So I used my Russian River keychain to open up this bottle and pour it to a Leffe glass.    A: The body is dark, coppery to brown hues but a bit crystalline. The head is white with some retention on the the smallest possible iteration and has some great lacing.    S: The aroma is composed with belgian yeast, raisins, blueberries and some alcohol due to the 10.20% ABV. If it wasn't for the alcohol, this aroma would be just perfect.    T: The taste is just perfect with the great taste of this belgian yeast, the dark roasted malts, the prominent raisins and the blueberries. But again, alchohol strikes again because it should, indeed, be a bit more hidden in all these flavors.    M: The body is very high, high carbonation that gives this velvety touch to the beer. If you look at the top of the glass, it seems that the yeast is still alive by creating small areas of activity but it's just the beautiful carbonation making its work.    O: The wait is over. And I'm very happy about this. By the end of this beer, I can say that this is not the perfect beer but it's by far the best quad I've had, which is a very subtle and hard style to make. Or probably is just the romantic side of a successful hunt speaking. I'm very happy at the moment and I feel like the spirit of craft beer is blooming inside of me. :) Thank you all you BAs!

A: rich mahogany red brown in colour with a consistently thick and productive head sitting about a centimetre (~1/2") and remaining throughout the beer  N: strong earthy tones, complex malts, raisins and other dried fruits  T: beautiful malt structure, complex and well balanced. Notes of raisin, caramel, slight sourness and well disguised ABV.   M: probably one of the stronger caracteristics of this beer for me. Full, velvety luxuriousness  O: great beer, no doubt. Hard to come by which adds to its cache. I would certainly never turn down the opportunity to try another, especially one that has aged, but it won't be my daily drinker. Lol

Lovely sweet taste with lots of flavours, sticky sweet fruit cakes, more dried fruit, breads, caramel.  Not as much alcohol in the taste as there was in the aroma.    Very easy to drink.

Incredibly well balanced.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5 Bottle received in a recent trade, drank and shared last night with some friends.    The one pours a dark leathery-looking brown, with a 1.5 inch head, and a little bit of lacing.    Smells like raisins, port wine, rum, caramel, tobacco, yeast phenols, and toffee.    This has a pretty crazy complexity to it, a perfect marriage of malt and yeast. It has a lot of raisin and dark fruit, first and foremost, gives off kind of the impression of port wine, with a spiced character that's reminiscent of rum. There's a bit of bitterness, kind of reminiscent of dark chocolate and tobacco, with some yeasty phenols, brown bread, and clove. There's so much going on in this beer and I can't get over how good it is.    This has a higher level of carbonation, with a pretty creamy mouthfeel.    The top of the mountain, so to speak. The view is pretty nice up here, and this is an absolutely world class beer in every way. A stunner.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottle at home in London with Lyoli. Vintage 2002, drank in 2013. Got this in a trade with Ian - thanks, mate! Pours lightly murky brown with a slight, tan foam head that quickly fizzes away into a few filmy bubbles before receding into nothing. The aroma holds all kinds of aged fruits, brown sugar, caramel, dates, figs, raisins, plums, suggestions of oxidation, rich bread, fruit cake. Flavor is big and sweet, lots of syrupy fruits, hints of tang to the dark berries, lots of brown sugar, plums, golden raisins, dates. Full bodied with soft carbonation. Lightly warming finish with lots of sticky sugars, overripe fruits, candied sugars, hefty caramel and dates, lots of sweet bread. Immensely complex and nuanced, and quite drinkable given the ABV. Additionally, the beer has aged gracefully. Absolutely world-class. Wonderful beer.

D: excellent M&T combo; couldn't believe this was a quad that's how well balanced and smooth this beer is. Excellent, wish I didn't have to go all the way back to Belgium to get another!

Excellent in all aspects, including a lively but very soft medium+ body. The flavor and aroma are loaded with dark dried fruits. Spot on bitter/sweet balance. Somewhat surprised that I so clearly preferred this over the Rochefort 10 that it was paired with. Also think I had a very slightly preference for the 2015 over the 2012 vintage, although both were thoroughly enjoyable.

A: Figs, raisins, plums, dark brown sugar, toffee, caramel, lots of aromas in this beer, bread notes, Belgian yeast, hint of alcohol, very complex with lots of depth.    T: Like the nose, there are notes of dark fruits like figs and plums, dark roasted and toasted candy, Belgian yeast, spice, clove, hint of banana, finish is dry with more dark fruits lingering in the aftertaste, very tasty, drinkable.     M: Full bodied with lots of carbonation, semi-dry finish, very smooth and creamy.    O: A world class beer, full of flavor, nice mouthfeel, lots of aroma, definitely worth the money I paid to get it. This is an amazing beer, I can't believe how drinkable it is for 10.2 % ABV, I won't hesitate to place another order for this beer.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 330ml bottle into a chalice; bottle courtesy of @benbking:    Appearance: pours a very dark, purplish brown color. Almost ruby-like. Carries a fair amount of yeast trub into the glass with it, even after settling for a while, though not nearly as much as Rochefort 10. Crazy amount of activity going on in the glass, with tons of bubbles rising up the edges and from the center. On top is a massive, stiff bed of foam, that sticks around forever. Literally for like a half hour.    Aroma: lots of stone fruit, and even some dark grape aroma. My first thought upon smelling it was flat grape soda, but upon giving it some more time, all the aromas came through. Spicy Belgian yeast, along with lots of dark, deep fruit notes. Plums mostly, although the dark grape notes are definitely there too.     Taste: very smooth and sweet, with tons of fruit flavor coming through. It's probably the fruitiest beer I've ever had, in strict terms of potency. If Julius and King Julius deliver the straight up orange juice, this beer is all plum, pomegranate, and grape. Incredibly smooth and refined. A touch of spice and some burnt sugar come through as well as the beer warms a bit.    Feel: LIghtly carbonated, this brew has a silky-smooth feel and coats the palate with flavor. It's not viscous, but carries a very full body nonetheless. None of the 10% ABV is detectable.    Overall: it was a pleasure to drink what many consider one of the best beers in the world. I agree with the assessment delivered by many prior beer drinkers. Even as tastes change, and people flock to hops, stouts, and sours (myself included) this beer will remain one of the best and most sought after brews, and for good reason. It's worth it!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Waited 5 years to try this beer, at one point (specifically when I first joined BA in 2010) this was rated as the #1 beer. The hype around this was immense, coupled with the fact it was nearly impossible to get, even more so as time went on and the abbey began to restrict sales to some notable traders. Finally found some in stock at an online store, so I threw some Cantillons in my cart and hit purchase, a week later here we are!    Poured from the yellow cap adorned, nondescript bottle into my favorite Gandhi glass snifter, it comes out a beautiful ruby brown, dark enough to not see through, but light enough around the edges to show its true colors. A super bubby off-white head pillows up and leaves moderate lacing.    Smell is lovely, a ton of malt and Belgian yeast, spicy, notes of plums. Taste begins with a big chewy bread note, followed by plums, fruits, molasses and rum flavors. Ends with a hint of roasted malt, some bitterness, and a nice yeasty esters.    Body is very bubbly and carbonated, it adds to the spice. Extremely light for the ABV. I think the body is one of the main selling points.    Overall a very nice quad, but I don't see the hype. I had Abt 12 from St. Bernardus a few months ago and I think the similarities are really obvious. This beer might beat it by a bit, but not by any significant measure. Maybe with age the differences are more prominent...

A - Murky, brown, thick, creamy head, poured all of it in my St. Bernardus glass even the yeast, they worked hard and I wanted to appreciate them too.    S - Smells of molasses, raisons, Belgian candi sugar at the homebrew store, caramel, toffee, biscuit malts.    T/M - WOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAHHH. This was my original white whale, I sadly gave up on it but came to work one day to find that my co-worker dropped it off on my desk after learning that I never had it yet. Taste is remarkable. People say fresh is better and I'll believe them once I try it in Belgium but damn, the carbonation was mellow, raisons, alcohol well hidden, dried dark fruits throughout, did not want this one to end.    O - The original and longest lasting #1 beer in the world honestly should still be up there. This beer is what brewing is all about. Exclusivity but not too crazy, spot-on style profile, amazing smells and tastes. If you close your eyes while enjoying it you may just imagine the monks brewing it, I didn't but you may.

I am having this before dinner to sharp my senses and pouring this to both the original chalice and in my Orval one. Interestingly, its appearance was much better on Orval’s.  It has a brown reddish color with a thick dark beige head with eternal retention and leaving a curtain of laces. Hard to beat for the style.  Nice aroma with notes of prunes, raisins, plums, raspberries, molasses, dark chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, grape juice, brandy and candied fruits. This is a bit more delicate than I expected, but elegant and still quite present.  Bold flavor with notes of figs, Port wine, creamy chocolate, noble hops, prunes, some molasses, bread crust, lots of spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, vanilla), peppery yeast, a bit of licorice, wood, a distant blue cheese, herbs, pear, apple puree, banana, mild tobacco, raisins, candi sugar and cherries. Dry and bitter aftertaste. Virtually it is easy to keep going naming more flavors.  Liquorish full body (not heavy) with perfect carbonation of tiny bubbles. Alcohol of 10.2% is subtle and disguised to trick you.  Needless to say this is an excellent beer. Huge fruit and malt complexity with enough hops to balance its sweetness and a phenolic vortex. Sure it is hard to live up to its legend and I am not sure this is really superior to Bernardus 12. Expectation is a bitch; still I cannot name definitely better non-barrel aged Quads (I could name very few equivalents).  Now I know why they don’t expand and let common men to brew this, it would lose its magic imaginative differential.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Description: More dark brown than ruby in color with a light tan/khaki head. The head quickly dissipates but leaves some lacing on the glass. Smell was a mix of dark fruits (dark/sour cherry, raspberry, red grapes) and possibly even some melon or maybe apricot. There was another acidic, fruity flavor that I couldn't quite place. The taste was sweet and fruity on the front of the palate and the grape flavor came through more clearly than with the aroma. There was a touch of bitterness on the finish which helped to balance the beer. The alcohol was certainly there but it didn't overwhelm the flavors. It was more carbonated than expected and the feel was on the thin side for a quad.    Suggested Food Pairing: Smoked white cheddar    If you like this beer then you should also try: Trappistes Rochefort 10    Overall: 4.25 (This beer is good and I would likely have it again) Certainly a good beer, but not one that I would rate as one of the best in the world. I really expected it to be more flavorful and full-bodied...generally "bolder" than it was. It seemed a little delicate to me, which isn't necessarily bad it's just not what I was looking for. In comparing it with other highly regarded Belgian quads I'd put it on par with Bernardus 12 but behind Rochefort 10. If you can get your hands on one it's worth trying (lots of people seem to think it's pretty fantastic) but it didn't blow me away.

Now that I have it warming up to 12 Celsius on my kitchen bench I find myself reflecting back over the last 5 years and 649 beer reviews: I’ve had a great time, it has been a real pleasure to taste so many fantastic brews and I’ve quite enjoyed writing every one of the 240,000+ words on the subject, as I hope many have enjoyed reading them. Well it’s time now to see what the monks of Sint-Sixtus can do.    Poured from a 330ml bottle into a Chimay chalice.    A: Presents with a cloudy caramel brown and nice dense 2 centimetre off-white head that slowly tapers back to a still dense half centimetre blanket on top. I’ve always loved the look of a decent Quad and this one is no exception - top marks. 10/10.    S: Sweet dark fruits (plum, prune, date) with a splash of brandy and some nice bready yeast tones. It’s not quite as complex as expected, but it is nonetheless a moreish Quad aroma. 8/10.    T: Sublime flavour profile - begins with the above noted dark fruits, touch of brandy, some mid palate bread and burnt sugar notes follow through to a hint of cracked pepper and an apothecary of herb characters - it’s difficult to pick an individual herb but if I had to I would say wormwood. This is a flavour profile that commands respect (although so does the MUCH cheaper St. Bernardus Abt 12). 10/10.    M: Medium to heavy bodied with a mid to light, dense carbonation. A touch of stickiness means you get a nice Quad sheen coating your tastebuds. 10/10.    D: Was it as good as I was expecting? No. Still it is one of the greatest Quadrupels I’ve managed to lay my hands on, and I’ve had a few Quadrupels now. Compared to its brethren St. Bernardus Abt 12 and Trappistes Rochefort 10 though it’s not worth the price or trouble you go through accruing it, and I suspect if it was a bit more available that it might not be so hyped, but there you go it is and St. Bernardus Abt 12 is my Quad of choice overall. As Westy XII warmed up even more a wild cherry note became present, how complex can a beer get? This guy. 9/10.    Food match: Obvious choice is cheese made by the sisters of Abbaye de Belval which uses Westvleteren beer to refine it, and other Trappist cheeses would work well.

At first its caramel soaked raisins that giveaway to bready stone fruit and belgian yeast esters!  Over all my favorite Quad   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Maybe mine was aged poorly, but tasted like iron filings and grape cool aid. Looked and smelled the part though. Probably need to try a fresher one. Eh.   
look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 First time having this. Before I get on, I will say that, I am cellaring a few bottles to try a year from now and 2 years from now. Had a 6 pack shipped in and just poured myself a nice chalice. Our came 2 fingers of foam. Nice dark brown body with vanilla looking head. A swirl, and it smells very familiar. Smells like malt, maybe a little coffee, roasted goodness. A few small tastes and I wasn't impressed. It was a little disappointing at first. Got better with each sip. The last couple were really smooth like a good creamy dessert. I want more! A fully circle experience. Not hooked but not turned off either. Will be interested in seeing what a little age does to these.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 My father-in-law bought boxes of these and gave it to me, so I have a lot. You are supposed to store them (cool) for a while but I've drank several already. It is a top notch Trappist/Quadruple.    L- Cloudy dark brown and not much of a head, but appearance is not that important.    S- Complex fruity and spicy aroma. Interesting and inviting.    T- Wow, it blew me away the first time I had it (now I had many). The taste was bready toasted malts, caramel, raisins, some spices, not too much, well balanced, and not a hint of alcohol despite the high alcohol content. It was easy drinking even for my friends who prefer blander styles.    F- silky smooth creamy.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 How can a beer with nothing but candy sugar and pils malt taste so good. Dark, Malty, Estery (not overly), would drink again everyday. 
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Review is of a 3 yr old bottle.     Pours a very murky, dirty brown color. Head is tan and 1/4th of an inch. Sediment is very evident throughout tasting. Head retention and lacing were above average.     Smell is big on dried and candied fruits, dates, figs, even some apricot. Belgian rock candy is also very present. Slight soy sauce is there, hops are not, and alcohol is definitely there.    Taste is heavy on caramelized sugar, dates, and figs. Burnt malt is also apparent, with belgian yeast/ witch hazel also present. Hops arent present but alcohol flavor is high.     Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Head retention added slightly to the substance of the beer.     Overall this was a good beer but dont know how it was once regarded as the best beer in the world. It was a solid beer for the style but there was nothing in the flavor profile that stood out to me.

Some many subtle flavor including vanilla and Carmel . So smooth. No bite from alcohol.     Feel. Carbonation perfect and some lacing but really just melts in mouth like a piece of dried fruit.

This was an aged Westy 12 I purchased when released in the U.S. This aged beautifully, with a nice cream/very light brown head, aromas of dried fruit and a touch of malt, flavor was similar with dried fruit soft mouthfeel and lingering finish. Can't wait till next year to open my last one and see what snother year does to this excellent ale.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Pours a deep reddish brown from the bottle. I was surprised by the carbonation, giving a creamy off-white head that remained for some time before settling down to a nice foam. I love the nose of bready malt mixed with Belgian yeast, then comes the fruit. Raisins, fig and prunes, giving way to candy and cloves. The candy is more prominent on the tongue, along with a bit of alcohol. Such a nice blend of fruit and spice. As for the mouth, it starts silky smooth, then becomes somewhat dry and crisp. This stands apart from the St. Bernardus Abt 12 moreso than I expected. Both are fine, excellent beers. Westvleteren, to me, has slightly more depth in all areas. It's wonderful.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 11.2 Oz. bottle poured into a Westvleteren chalice. Date on bottle cap says 10.02.15.    Appearance: Pours a deep brownish amber with a moderate amount of bubbles. Solid finger of off white head that settles into a thin creamy layer that sticks around.     Smell: A very juicy and nicely sweet yeast driven aroma with a big scent of dark fruit, spices, and caramel. Belgian yeast with hints of funk, clove, pepper, and cinnamon. Big presence of fruit with hints of dark grapes, raisin, cherry, fig, plum, prune, dates, banana, pear, and apple. Malt hints of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, straw, and mild chocolate. Sweet hints of candied sugar. Nice hints of leather and tobacco as well as some light anise. Hops are pretty subtle. A really great aroma.     Taste: As great as it smells, a juicy, spicy, and sweet yeast driven taste with notes of dark fruit, spice, and caramel malt. Belgian yeast with good spice notes of clove, pepper, cinnamon, and funk. Lots of fruit with notes of dark grapes, fig, raisin, plum, cherry, prune, dates, banana, apple, and pear. Sweet taste of Belgian candied sugar. Toasted malt notes of caramel, toffee, biscuit, toast, straw, and subtle chocolate. Also some notes of tobacco, leather, and slight anise. Hops are very light. A really great taste.     Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with a medium to high level of carbonation. Juicy, creamy, and drying on the finish. Alcohol heat is minimal.     Overall: A truely great Quad that lives up to it's status as one of the best beers in the world. Great complex blend of fruit flavors, spice, and caramel malt. Glad I finally got my hands on a bottle.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 This was my 3rd and 4th Westy 12. One of them was brought back from Belgium and the other was from the one time U.S. release. For me, this beer lives up to the hype! I will say however, each of the 4 of these I've been lucky to drink have all been slightly different. My favorite two were both from Belgium (one consumed there and one consumed here with 4 years age on it). The U.S. release version that I had last night was slightly sweeter but the finish wasn't as smooth. Anyway, must try beer for any Belgian lover!

Strong presence right out of the bottle. It is perhaps, one of the most complex & full beer experiences in 50 years of brewing appreciation. Each taste provides a different layer for the senses. It has the weight of a barleywine but is so much more delicate. Licorice, chocolate, cardamon, anise, coffee, spruce they are all present but understated. The finish is long lasting & very clean/dry. This is something that should be sought after by anyone who is serious about making the leap into the very best the brewing world has to offer.

A euphonic harmony comprising just the right amount of everything good about beer-- just the right mixture of sour, bitter, smoothness, maltiness, and hopiness. The only imperfection is the smell, but that's a personal thing. I generally find Trappist ales to smell soapy. I married into a Belgian family with a connection to the brewery so I get to enjoy a 12-pack every year or two, which I always share, earning me some major friend points.

look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 went on a beer tour in brussels and they kept talking about this beer as the holy grail over there. at the end of the tour, the guide took a few of us to his local bar where he knows they had a case of these for sale. We tried a few other "copies" as he called it on the tour, but this by far was the best beer i had while there. Just as the pic shows, it was a plain brown bottle and he advised us to keep the cap as evidence we have actually had this elusive beer. Its an online lottery system to get the beer from the abbey, and you need to submit your license and license plate number and show up without one of the two and they will not sell you the beer. crazy.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 A: The beer is very dark brown in color (black when viewed from afar). It poured with a half finger high light tan colored head that died down, leaving a short head covering the surface and a coating of bubbles around the edge of the glass. When held up to the light, I can make out some clumps of yeast floating near the bottom of the glass.  S: Moderate aromas of dark fruits are present in the nose along with notes of malty sweetness and hints of candi sugars.  T: Similar to the smell, the taste is dominated by flavors of dark fruits—plums and prunes seem to stand out in particular—and has some malty and candi sugar sweetness along with hints of clumpy yeast. Only faint bits of alcohol are perceptible.  M: It feels a bit more than medium-bodied and a little smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.  O: This quadrupel bursts out with lots of flavors of dark fruits and associated sweetness but is quite drinkable considering its strength because it does a very good job at hiding its alcohol. Comparing this to my notes for the Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt. 12, I didn't pick up any of the spices that I picked up in those other beers—this one seems to be fruitier.    Note: 2012 vintage    Serving type: bottle

This is the best version of the style I have ever tried. People comparing ABT to Westy and claiming they are close...not to me.     On the nose are baking spices, brown sugar, dates, and the slightest bits of bready malt and cocoa.  Taste follows the nose. All dark fruits, candied dates, brown sugar and some booze. Then the carbonation comes along and cleans everything up. To me that is the only problem, a bit too many bubbles for my liking for the style and hence the reduction in points.     Overall great experience and worth seeing out even if only once.

Patience is a virtue with quads and this one is no exception. A belgian quad symphony but with a caveat, though, that Abt 12 is just a notch below and at a fraction of the retail and / or trading price. I'm glad I tried this for the first time but won't plan to seek it out again.

Smooth, malty, spicy and complex, without the high viscosity of many American and other Belgian quads.  It's somewhat light bodied for a beer of this size, which works well. As the Belgians call it "digestable".  Had it once again recently, a leftover from 12/12/12 and once again it was fantastic! This is one beer that definitely lives up to the "hype" ! Truly one of the top ten beers In the world!!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Got at a bottle shop in Brussels and at a bar. Has some serious floaties. Really enjoyed the taste and smell. Not sure it's my favorite quad but it's definitely up there. Brought two bottles back and recently enjoyed them after cellaring for a year or so and they were delicious.

This being the hardest to find and most sought after let myself, and my significant other down. She likes a sweeter quad and tend to pull more towards Rochefort, and I lean towards St bernardus. Westy was TOO sweet. Body/feel/color all perfect. Just a let down on the taste. But hey, A bad day drinking Westy is better than most other days so take it FWIW.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Appearance – The beverage poured a deep murky brown with some white bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.     Smell – It is hard to nail the nose on this one. I will say it resembles smoky prunes.     Taste – Malty prunes is a good start on the description. There is syrup, raisins, and a higher than expected level of carbonation that brushes away the sweetness. The dark fruits linger in the aftertaste.     Mouthfeel – I was a little surprised by the high carbonation. It brushed aside the sweetness, making the aftertaste drier than expected.     Overall – I admit was expecting a little more. Is the carbonation a symptom of this batch being off? Or is the high machine to forceful on this one?

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Entered from my notes of October 18. This opportunity was provided by the incredibly generous snaotheus upon his return from a trip to Belgium. I compared this to Rochefort 10 and ABT 12 side by side.    Color is dark mahogany with a dense tan head that faded pretty quickly. Smell is all about the yeast and booze - it has a very complex blend of dark fruits, toffee, some honey, and of course, booze. Flavor is dark fruit, brown sugar and booze - very nice. Body is not as full as I expected - medium with a light carbonation. Overall, it's a great beer and deserves its reputation. In the comparison to the other beers, it was the winner - with a very similar flavor profile to the ABT 12. Surprisingly to me, the Rochefort 10 paled in comparison to the other two. I'd like a chance to repeat the tasting to see if that verdict holds - anyone else want to bring me a bottle of W12? :^)

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I cannot really add more to the wonderful reviews displayed here.   Suffice to say that my favourite pub owner ordered a couple of bottles for our little gathering, and even at CDN$20/bottle, it was worth the try. Clearly, at that price, I would not make a habit of purchasing it (though some other pubs sell it for as much as CDN$40).   But I digress.  The nose, the head, the taste - all top class. Strong hints of grapes and so much more overwhelms your senses, just as Heady Topper does.   Brilliance in a bottle. Still, St. Bernardus easily beats it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2011 bottle. Very complex quad, smells not like anything I've had before. Dark fruits, alcohol, almost an oatmeal cookie type scent. Taste is so good, so smooth and balanced. Worth the effort to try.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 12 oz bottle poured into a tableglass. Pours a deep auburn, with a two finger tan head. Baker's yeast on the nose, with fermenting sugar. The palate leads with a full-bodied, yeasty, bread note, accompanied by dates and raisins. Hints of brown sugar are well-accompanied by a warm alcohol undertone, which is the only reminder of the 10ish% ABV. Mouthfeel intermediate. Overall, an exceptional Quad. Not overly spiced like many of the entries from Unibroue or Ommegang nor overly sweet either. There's an excellent harmony between the yeast, spice, sugar, and alcohol notes in this beer that ultimately make this a wonderfully balanced and complex beer.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Here we go! After waiting for a long time I finally got my hands on one of these. Dark liquid, the color of a dark date, surmounted by a beige head that lasts for a long long time and formed by big bubbles. The aroma is so very rich. Dates, figs, dark sugar, almonds, marzipan, honey. Comparing it to Rochefort 10, it promises to be sweeter and less on the fruity side. The taste is a bit weaker than I expected but still phenomenal. Dark fruits, bread and no alcohol whatsoever. I believe I have some bitter aftertaste, on grassy notes, but not very pronounced. Creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation. In the end, an exquisite beer. However, is this the absolute king of quads? I believe it's overall pretty close to Rochefort 10, and extra points might be due to the hype. Don't get me wrong, I think this reputation is deserved, but should be shared with another beer!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 330mL bottle from the fall 2012 American release. Served in a pretentious, matching gold-rimmed Westvleteren XII goblet.     Pours a turbid, dark chestnut with a three quarter finger cap of beige head. Some sort of yeast or particulate is visible in suspension. The foam settles to a beautiful, full, fluffy halo and a wide lingering island. Only a few scattered specks of lace find purchase.     The aroma is fruity with a good but of sweet Belgian yeast up front. Toffee, dark fruit, brown sugar, cocoa and bread round and it the nose. Very nice.     The flavor explodes with dark fruit. Raisins, figs, plum, brown sugar, toffee, fruity and mildly funky Belgian yeast, semi tart cherry skin, caramel, bread, subtle chocolate, apple, honey, hints of earth and a faint tickle of alcohol that is only occasionally noticeable. The flavors drift in and amongst each other and amount to a smooth, delicious blend with everything working in harmony. Truly delicious.     Rich, creamy, full body with soft carbonation. Finishes with pleasing notes of toffee, dark fruit and yeast.     Westvleteren XII definitely stands as best in class of the Belgian quadruples. The flotsam and jetsam in the body does not phase me a bit and I think this is a world class brew in every respect. The price of admission was admittedly high but I am very happy to have tried this fresh and at one and three years old. I'm looking forward to continuing to follow its development over the next five years or so.
