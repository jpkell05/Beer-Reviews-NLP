look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Look - Pours a light clear yellow color, yet darker than a lager. Small head.  Smell - Potent with hop characteristics and lingering bitterness.  Taste - Initially bold with the hop profile with a creamy, yet still bitter finish.   Feel - Medium mouthfeel. Slightly better than average carbonation.  Overall - Bold with the hops and bitterness like an IPA, but with a creamier and smoother flavor as it lingers. The wheat is minimally pronounced. It is hard for me to discern any wheat flavor among the strong hope profile. A strong, and bitter IPA-like brew that overshadows the American wheat characteristics.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 12oz bottle poured into snifter glass...    Look:  Poured orange/almost ochre with very very slight murk, minimal egg-white head.    Smell:  Slight pungent grapefruit, fragrant, sweet pine, honey, and some bread.    Taste:  Sweet spicy mango, peppery, pine hoppiness.    Feel:  Medium body. Crisp and good carbonation with clean bite.    Overall:  This was a good beer. It’s in a class above average for craft. Since I usually have a taste for something very particular at a given time (i.e. hoppy, wheat, roasted malt, etc.), I don’t know that I would get this again. This brew is a cross-section of many styles... a “fusion” of sorts.

Taste is tropical fruits, wheat, orange peel, and a hint of yeast. Some bitterness kicks in towards the end. Lighter body, low carbonation. Easy drinker, not huge on the flavor but enough so. For it's ABV, it's deceptively easy to drink but not a ton of complexity to it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This, is an exceptional beer. Also, it is what made me value Lagunitas brewery very high. It has all of the necessary feel and weight into it, and is not a light beer, but at the same time so drinkable and effort-taking. It just slips right down your throat. As I am not an expert, I wonder what is in this ale beer that differentiates it from others. Out of all the beers I've tasted until now, there certainly is "similar" taste to this but I'm sure nothing's exactly the same. Anyways, out of my few (3~4) years of beer tasting (roughly under 50 kinds), goes right up to the top of my list along with Allagash Tripel Ale. I've also tasted Lagunitas IPA, and while that one is somewhere around top 10, this would be in my top 3. Would recommend this beer to others any day.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 This is what Racer 5 and other "delicious" IPAs should taste like. Gone is that nasty IPA aftertaste, replaced with that golden wheat flavor. Has enough fruity yeast tones to keep it interesting. Smell is fantastic and the lacing and clear golden look is beautiful. Has 7.5% alcohol and you could drink it all day (or at least until you pass out on your pizza). Another winner from my neck of the woods.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pours a slightly foggy straw color with two fingers of white, foamy head. Aroma is straw, orange peel, yeast with bread, biscuit, and pale malts. It smells clean. Flavor profile is wheat, straw, orange peel, and a light yeast finish that comes with a little dry rye spice. There is bread, biscuit and pale malts. Mouth feel is slightly effervescent, which mingles well with a light grainy texture to keep this beer drinking smooth and session-able, and yet with a palpable, soothing texture. Overall, a great, straightforward wheat beer that remains well constrained, while still providing a tasty beverage.    Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.

The bitterness and slight astringency leaves a long after taste. Mellows out after some time.    O: Smells really fresh and bright, but is deceptively hoppy and the alcohol is well hidden. Fruity/honey sweetness permeates throughout

Lagunitas hits it out of the ballpark again!

Aroma was fruity-hoppy when first poured, almost watermelon. Half-way through the glass it transitioned to horse-barn (not wet horse blanket).  Taste is not reminiscent of the aroma. Was okay for the first few sips but moved on to have an odd taste on the back end that's tough to describe, but I'll fall back on "horse barn". I liked the bittering, prominent but not overpowering.   Throughout there was a slickness remaining in my mouth after each swallow.  The redeeming factors were the color and initial aroma immediately after the pour.    Maybe the one I had was past its prime, but if my bottle is indicative of the brew it's not for me.

look: 2.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This is a great beer which defies categorization. Beeradvocate has it listed as an "American Pale Wheat Ale," whatever that is, but I'd say it's closest to an IPA.     I poured from a bottle into a pint glass. It's a clear, pale, golden color, with moderate carbonation (perhaps a little more than average) and a thin but long-lasting head. It's hoppy but not particularly bitter, and there's no annoying bitter aftertaste. The wheat content gives it a smooth malt flavor. Crisp, slightly piney. Given its smooth, refined taste, the relatively high ABV is surprising. Overall, a pleasant, clean-tasting, IPA-like brew.

The beer pours bright golden amber in color with abundant sticky nearly white head. The aroma is mild with pine, light caramel and tangerine intermingled. The taste is piney and citrusy with a little semisweet caramel. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. The finish is nicely bitter with a resinous note, but the wheat keeps everything a little soft and less dry. Overall, very good. Really enjoy this one fresh.

The beer is a little boozy and feel a little thicker for the style.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Lagunitas makes great beers but they don't put the date on the bottle which is frustrating, there is a code for it. The one I am drinking was bottled about two months ago.   Pours a slightly darker than straw color with only moderate carbonation. Decent head of foam. Smells fresh with fairly typical IPA flavors of fruit and pine. Can also smell the wheat malt, it smells really good.   The taste is initially strong hop but it quickly fades to a rich malt on the palate. Tastes of grapefruit, peach, and orange. Finishes crisp and refreshing as expected. Extremely easy to drink for a 7.5%. For those wondering how this compares to Lagunitas IPA, the flavors are a little different. Much more rich maltness with this one. I find Sumpin Sumpin to be lighter body than most beers at this ABV. Overall, it's not an absolute hop bomb but it has lots of sharp flavors and freshness.   Overall grade is a very good A-   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Clear light amber.  Lasting foamy head.  Prominent bright citrus aroma.  Light cereal sweetness.  Complex citrus hoppiness that Lagunitas does quite well. Finishes with a bit of lingering bitterness.  Feels a bit thin, and carbonation is a higher than average.  Tasty hoppy ale.

Smooth finish and mouthfeel with some good carbonation. This one started off really subtle and then the IPA flavors hit me in a gradual, amazing way. Very impressive!

This one is huuuuuge!  First of all, if this is a wheat ale, it was a genius who got rid of that typical German/Belgian yeast and now this is all pale. Because it lets all the hops take control - it smells oranges instead! Amazing! Fruity but not that IPA punch but nice and subtle with minimum bitterness.  And then you drink it and it's all good. Like a pale ale, maybe with a little more characteristic body (guess these are the wheat malts) but everything else is 100% typical American - in a good way. This is a punchy pale - wheat - ale. Outstanding. Loving it bigtime. And we are on 7.5% ABD and nowhere is any booziness. As light as SNPA! This beer is truly a materpiece, full of hidden layers but then again it is so simple that you couldn't be wanting for more. This is a bullseye. Wish all wheat ales were like this.    As the notes are taken, let me quote the real one here:    "So, we're all on collective disability. That's cool. Let's put some ice on it and keep ourselves elevated for a while. So, what's on the tube...? Honey..? Get me a beer from the fridge... Will ya..? Sweetie..? Pleeease..?    Beer Speaks. People Mumble."

Look: A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale is a beautiful golden colour with medium foam.  Smell: A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale assembles an alcohol associated musk.  Taste: A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale has a sweet hoppy flavour.  Feel: A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale has a medium amount of carbonation with a good alcohol content.  Overall: People who enjoy sweet and hoppy beers would be happy with A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale.

Pours a light amber with a faint white head.    Malty aroma with a hint of hops.    Odd flavor --- mostly malt, prickly citric beginning with sweeter finish.     Medium mouthfeel with some prickliness.    This apparently is a a wheat pale ale, so I wish it had more of the wheat element to it.

Smells is best described as citrus like, mostly like grapefruit. Most would find as a good smelling beer     The taste has a citric flavor with a more hoppy aftertaste, the amount of carbonation on this feels about perfect, very drinkable definatlely a favorite. The strength of this beer for me is the easy drinkabliltiy this is the perfect beer to get people into more craft beer, since it’s a delicious with out being too outlandish. A personal fave.

Very pleasant aftertaste. I would definitely drink this year round if Lagunitas would release it year-round.

Left good lacing.    S---Sweet, citrus fruit (orange & grapefruit). A bit of pine in there as well.    T---Hops are prominent. Orange & grapefruit are at the front of all of the fruitiness.     F---Quenching. Nicely carbonated feel helps it go down easy. Feels like one you'd have several of on a hot day (7.5 ABV might make that a questionable idea, though).    O---Lagunitas produces high quality stuff and this falls in line with what they do. Excellent.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Drank in Café Académico, Coimbra.    Label states that the beer has some wheat besides some barley, but coloration isn't that much opaque.    Poured into a Anchor Brewing tumbler glass.    A: The body is yellow and crystalline having no opaqueness at all. Head is white, it's not massive at all, being just a bit weak but creates some lacing.  S: The aroma is just slightly hoppy and citric having some clove in the back, which led me to believe that this beer is an American Wheat Pale Ale. I got to RateBeer and seen that it was an IPA but when I got to BeerAdvocate and Untappd, I could confirm that it is in fact an AWPA. Good stuff.  T: Taste isn't incredible as it is just a little bit bland and empty, having very minimal profiles of citrus. On top, some clove incoming from the wheat and also more sweetness are both present in the beginning of the taste. In the end, the taste's a lot more empty having a finish similar to a lager almost, being only composed with corn-like sweetness and just a small hint of bitterness incoming from the soft hops.  M: Body is low. Carbonation is medium to low. Alcohol is unnoticed though running at 7.5% ABV. Sweetness is medium and bitterness is medium to low.  O: Not a bad American Wheat Pale Ale but could use a lot more flavour.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Bottled 1/31/18, consumed 2/25/18    Poured crystal clear golden & light amber with a good sized head that left good lacing.    Aroma is citrus fruit and piney hops, not very strong but certainly very pleasant.    Taste is much more pronounced fruitiness than the aroma, balanced with sweet bread malt, wheat, and piney & floral hops.    Mouthfeel is medium, easy bitterness for the level, good carbonation, dry finish.    Overall, this is a pretty spectacular wheat ale, especially for the price! IPA lovers, jump right in, this brew delivers in every way. Just can't hate on Lagunitas putting out top quality brews at a great price.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a tall clear glass. The beer has a glowing resplendent gold color, with a slight hint of orange. Has a large head, good retention. Moderate carbonation.    Smells very prominent of fruity and tropical scents, along with a piney composition. Other smells are pineapple, oranges, resin, light caramel, other citrus, and a very faint pepper. Overall very sweet, very pungent.     Has a strong and sour hoppy taste upon the first sip. Bitterness is accompanied by a wheaty and piney body, followed by cloves, some grapefruit, tangerine, oranges, pineapple, and a kick of lemon peel. Basically a bitter hoppy wheat beer with some good spices and tropical mix. Feels creamy smooth and medium on the palette.    This is pretty nice. I feel confused over whether this tastes more wheaty or more IPA.

Finishes with a nice, medium dry bitterness. I'm not really getting any wheat/yeast character from this at all, seems more like a strong Pale Ale to me. A pretty nice one at that though, no discernible boozyness to this at all. I liked this a LOT more than their IPA, with a stronger hop presence and great malt balance.

For a relatively "easily found" beer this is a near go-to for me lately. There's nothing out of place with this brew. Very nice fruity smell straight away, palate is a fruity and hoppy bomb of goodness, already better described by others. easy to drink for an ~7.5% or so wheat ale with a bit of pizazz. This has very good to nearly wonderful body, unlike a few others in this class - and to me, no off-putting linger or anything unexpected. It's a stand-out , excellent, readily available beer; 4.5/5, to me.

This beer manages to capture that intense 420 smell and taste without finishing too bitter. And it's not even a NEIPA! It's priced fairly and my mouth waters every time I pop a cap. I'd rank it 5 across the board if it came in cans.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a clear yellow color with a thin white head. Smell reminds me of a Sierra Nevada pale ale, piney and citrusy.

Overall, I place this more in the league with a SN Torpedo, ABV included, still a solid beer that is in between a pale ale and a true IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 The color is orange and a very little haze. The smell is floral hops and little grainy.  The taste is a little bitter and has a hoppy citric flavor. The body is medium.   I like it but maybe would add a little more dry hop.

T: Sweet malt, and a little sweet fruit, that is balanced out by a strong piney and floral bitterness.    F: Medium to fuller body and creamy smooth carbonation    O: While the aroma isn't very strong, this beer reminds me a lot more of an IPA than a wheat beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Really fantastic ale. I've only seen it in bottles but this would make a great canned beer, too. Bright and crisp, modern flavor with medium strong hoppiness which can come across a little strong on its own but great with food. High alcohol content but the hops takes the edge off the sugar content so the alcohol and sweetness is tamed from a flavor standpoint. If you are going for a one and done beer night A Little Sumpin' ale would be an excellent choice. Whatever recipe came together for this one, which is my favorite of the Lagunitas line, really holds together. It is a standalone classic. Both refreshing and flavorful. It is an aromatic ale with no off tastes. It is sure to be a favorite and likeable even to non beer drinkers. This is my favorite beer when drinking one beer.

It si described as “Silky and Smooth” and lives up to this expectation very well . The sweet fruit that you can not only smell but taste over powers the hops just enough. Consider this a Sour Patch Kid of a beer , The color is Dark and golden yellow , with a tropical nose and the right amount of head. at 64 IBU and 7.5% ABV this Ale is always great choice.

A super complex hop and rich floral flavor that is still easy to drink. I keep looking for a better beer and have not found one yet.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 From a 355ml bottle served at 9 degrees Celsius into a snifter. Best before date: 24.03.2018    Look: The beer pours a brilliant gold with 2cm of white, puffy head that dissipates into a partial film after 2+ minutes. Exceptional lacing. Maybe a weisen glass would have increased the head and its retention.    Smell: Mild intensity and sweet-ish balance. American, citrusy, floral, and piney hops. Low malt character.    Taste: Same notes as the aroma. No esters or phenols.    Feel: Medium body with moderate carbonation. Creamy with some restrained alcohol warming.    Overall: Not as hoppy as IPA's or some APA's but certainly hoppier than your average weissbier. Less yeast, more hops. 7.5% ABV is well-hidden. It's a good brew.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A very good quality Ale. Smell is citrus and hops, and the taste is exactly as the smell indicates. Hops are at the end of the beer, but it is blended well. Overall, i enjoy the wheat based ales, and this is no different. A good refreshing beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours pure gold into a fifteen ounce mug the same temperature as the beer. Two finger dense white head that dissipates slowly. Some nice lacing. Lots of streaming tiny bubbles.    Very mild on the nose with some citrus malts and maybe some ripe white grapefruit. A touch of wheat malt.    The first thing with the flavor is mild citrus hops. Not bitter at all. Malts are there but not outstanding. The surprising thing is that its tastes like really good beer. Dry finish but crisp and refreshing. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation.     A very good all around beer that you could drink all day. Session beer at its finest. Whether or not it meets the standard for the type, I don't know neither do I care:)). Cheers!!

The frothy 2 finger head lasts for the whole glass and drapes it in foam. Delicate orange, lemon, floral notes in the nose. The taste is hoppy with a distinct orange character. Grapefruit and some aspirin in the back. A bit of tart, clean wheat maltiness provides some balance. The mouthfeel is light bodied with smooth moderate carbonation. The finish is moderately bitter and abundantly fruity.     This is a fantastic American Pale Wheat. Super hoppy and boozy for the style, but complex and delicious. A classic and a must try.

Hop forward, citrusy, piney, with a nice bite of a grapefruit rind, A medium body, and deceptively drinkable despite the 7.5% alcohol when in fact it has more alcohol than most single IPAs. I was basically crushing it before I looked at the label. There is nothing unique here but it is incredibly well crafted.

No carbonation was seen rising. The smell had the citrus and pine up front with some light malts in the background. The taste had a bit more pine in front than the rest of the flavors. The palate sits about a medium with nothing harsh on the tongue, standard. Overall, wow, I actually did not think this beer was going to be this good.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Nice white lacing head with a clear golden minimum weight body . Floral minimum bitter hop "likely cascade" with a under layers of citrus, grapefruit and peach. Dry and short finish, the bitterness doesn't linger. For the 7.5% weight it is fairly easy drinking and very crushable "Likely the wheat grain used". Well made and I like it close to room temp. Little Sumpin' is another generic IPA and nobody is missing anything if it's skipped. But if you like IPA's it's recommenced.

Smells amazing: tropical fruits, cannabis, pine, and grapefruit. Pours a beautiful gold with a decent head and nice lace. Taste is grapefruit, honey note with a nice hoppy bite but not overdone or overpowering on the hops. I love this beer! One of my favorites. I know there is debate among some beerheads whether this is an IPA and in my humble opinion it is and is one of the best IPAs if not the best. For what it's worth I get no wheat flavors from this beer at all.    Quick tip: this pairs excellently with thai food

It's hard to find much complexity in this, so there is not much reason you should ever have it, unless you always wanted to get drunk on flavoured water.

Aroma - Pine sap, honey, a bit of weed but it isn't 420 blaze it levels of dank.  Taste - Pink grapefruit, sugar, a resinous pine note. Malt is light and crackery. Sweeter towards the finish with an oily pine sap flavor that I've grown to enjoy from Lagunitas' beers.  Feel - Medium bodied, fine bubbles, creamy but finishes refreshing and dry. Alcohol well hidden. Incredibly drinkable, which is typical from this brewery.    Overall - I'm really more of a malt guy. I tend to gravitate more towards barleywines, brown ales and Belgians, but I can enjoy a beer like this. Good hop flavor but has some malt to back it up.

The taste and feel reminds me more of an IPA. Strongly carbonated beer with a light white head.    = A real winner here. I normally don't indulge in wheat ales but this brew is distinct and can pass for a great IPA. One of the best wheat ales I've ever had.

It has all the bitterness of a good Cali IPA, with a good bready balance, and none of that ick that ruins most wheat beers that people tell me are supposed to be "refreshing."    Well this is refreshing--and delicious.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Look - clear and golden with a white head, great retention, and pretty lacing.  Smell - crisp hops in the form of citrus and pine along with caramel malts and faint yeast notes.  Taste - rich hoppy flavors are strongest, similar to the nose, but there's also a sweet malty backbone that rounds it out. It finishes dry with yeast notes lingering in the aftertaste.   Feel - high carbonation, medium body, and smooth finish.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This is the first real craft beer I've tried, and I was very impressed by it's quality and relative affordability.  The look is just plain awesome, with a golden color and creamy 1.5 finger head.  You can smell the alcohol, but you also get floral scents; a lot of citrus notes, not very off putting.  The taste is extraordinarily citrusy and bitter, but not too harsh, grapefruit is what I can pick out the most, subtle maltiness in the flavor. Is rather hop forward for a wheat beer (not a bad thing), and very vibrant on the palate  The feel is also like drinking grapefruit juice, although a lot smoother. Not harsh by any means, but you can feel the bitterness on the back end. Very refreshing to drink.  This was by dar rhe hoppiest beer iv tried. For a wheat ale, it drinks a lot like an IPA with its hop fowardness, which again, isn't a bad thing. This was a very refreshing beer to drink, especially at a barbecue! I'm kinda mad that I only had 2 beers out if the 6 pack I bought, but that's what beer is for, right? To enjoy with good company during fun times! Glad I had this for my first real craft beer.

While I always had my eye on it while shopping for a good opener, I finally got the right chance to buy it. It was only a sixer, and I paid a decent $12 for it with taxes and everything; well worth the money I'd say. It poured beautifully, I truly do not like drinking out of a bottle if I can avoid I will. It caught me buy surprise but it was perfect, i wasn't expecting it to hit the spot the way it did. I didn't pair it with anything, I had it with a few buddies, and I'll have to say it's one of the beers I will be buying for occasions from here on out.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Mostly clear with a golden amber color. Bubbly head with solid retention and lacing. Aroma is fruit and citrus with some bread malt.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pale, translucent yellow. Smells of wheat, yeast, orange, and a hint of berry. Taste is driven by piney hops upfront, followed by a nice, slick, malt finish. Overall, a strong, well-balanced beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Another fine pale ale from lagunitas..    Big malt background to balance,out any amount of hops they want to add..    My favorite so far is still their day time session ale but this could replace it easily and has more abv.    Lagunitas knows how to brew an ipa/apa/pale ale

It has a nice clear hue and developed a decent head when poured into a tulip glass. The aroma is nice with hints of apricot/citrus and it finishes very clean. Feel is great, although the beer needs a rather vigorous pour to develop a nice head.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A drinkable hoppy ale, with a well balanced profile.    Foam quickly dissipates, and the first taste semi-sweet, citrusy, only slightly bitter, and very drinkable.    It is a fairly strong beer, but doesn't taste so. You have to watch out with this one.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This is an ideal beer for someone who likes wheat and fruit undertones in beer. Pours with a nice dusky amber color, raises a good head. Scent is a little sour, possibly the only off putting attribute of this beer. Taste is wonderful, with hints of peach and apple; good mouth feel, but not thick. Easy to drink.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 I poured it into a ceramic mug (all ive got at college) Beautiful orange yellow amber type color. Head was small, off white, size of head probably reduced by the container and my cruddy wash job.   Smells fruity, pineapple maybe, citrus with a hoppy smell at the very end.     Taste is sweet initially with a kind of hoppy bite to it, the sweetness persists for a while, becoming really nice in the middle of my swallow before giving in to hop bitterness in the aftertaste. The sweetness might put some people off but it seems well balanced to me, and definitely doesn't give away the alcohol content. Do yourself a favor and stock up on this one, I have had a craving for it for months. Overall maybe the best ipa I have had so far.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Look: 4.75  A beautiful gold color and very clear. A 2-finger head was generated from a 12oz bottle pour. Decent head retention. A nice and vigorous bubbling continues on.     Smell: 4.25  A pungent citrus and pine aroma. A slight caramel/malty sweetness as well. It is quite sweet and tart smelling.    Taste: 4.75  A nice hoppy bite at first. The bitterness lingers even though sweet malt and toffee wedges in. It has a bit of a smoky flavor when the hops and malt back off. It is quite savory and buttery tasting.    Feel: 4.5  Medium bodied. Quite bubbly and interesting on the tongue.    Overall: 4.5  This is a great IPA from Laguanitas (yet another). I would most definitely buy a 6 pack of this (or any package). Bought as a single in a mixed 6.

Nice.    S: Pear, apricot and cantaloupe with a tangy undertone of pineapple, blood orange and passion fruit, ending in black peppery spicy notes.    T: Sour initially, with apricot and pineapple building into blood orange, grapefruit, tangerine, cloves, pepper, and bitter pine for a finish. Very hop-forward.    F: Creamy, smooth, delicious. Exactly what I hope for from beer.    O: Fantastic IPA. Perhaps the greatest ever brewed on such a large scale.

They recommended Sumpin' Sumpin' as having some citrus and good balance wheat IPA, and boy they were right. Plus its a Chicago beer and I love the Windy City. Middle of the road amber clear color, smell is a mix of hops, wheat, citrus, smooth going down and a little bitter finish. A nice alternative to Fresh Squeezed. I would definitely recommend it as a regular beer to have in your fridge, your friends will be impressed.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass. Dark amber, visible carbonation, light quarter finger head, consistent lacing.     Smell is light. There is citrus, pine, resin, raspberries, light wheat,    Taste is the bomb. Crisp citrus, wheat, hop, some spice. It starts wheat then everything else comes in layers. Damn. It's all there, just such balance and in order. That's always an accomplishment, nothing hits hits you over the head.     Feels so damn good. Good carbonation,light oils, dryness, clean finish. ABV is very well hidden, I always like that.    What is it A wheat? An IPA? Not sure. If you love both, it gives you both. If you only love one or the other, well it gives you enough, too. It's a fine offering, so satisfying. I am always happy to see this on my local store shelf. Great beer.

Tastes of orange zest, hops, wheat, and some yeast. Medium in body and carbonation. Overall an almost perfect example for an american wheat ale. This was not only my first Lagunitas from long ago, but the first craft beer (and legal beer) that I ever tried. And it didn't disappoint.

Memorable.     12oz. cold bottle - no date    Pours a cloudy orange/gold-copper with a thin white head. Leaves a nice film on the glass.   The taste is oranges/citrus; fruity mixed with hops. Crisp hints of pine, wheat and spice. Bright and fresh. My guess is this brew ages poorly. It tastes hoppier than many wheat Americans. Delicious.     For a mass market beer that can be found at the specialties and grocery chains alike - nationally, it's special. It's a outstanding warm weather beer but it's available year round.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Bottle at De Paas. Clear golden with a thin white head. Notes of oranges, grapefruit, caramel and pine resin Medium body, medium carbonation and a bitter-sweet aftertaste.

The taste was fascinating. The clean creaminess of wheat shines through mellow and juicy to start but the finish is citrussy with a lightly sweet mandarin orange and balanced with the herbaceous green hops bitterness. Nicely balanced. I especially appreciated the creamy texture which surprisingly went nicely with the orange tartness.

It just screams, "try me".    Smell: hints of citrus (perhaps acai berry?), lingering hoppiness. Slight coriander-like spiciness.    Taste: whoa so unique. Not quite a wheat beer, not quite an ipa. It really stands out. Quite complex. Mid-palate hops (amarillo or centennial hops) with a scrumptious citrus taste that stays in your mouth for hours.     Feel: not overly bitter, very nice going down. High drinkability.    Overall: lil' sumpin sumpin is simply outstanding.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 I get a nose of citrus hops with this beer. To me it tastes like a good IPA like a Hopdevil or similar.

Wet lingering faint bitterness.

look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 The various iterations of the "little sumpin'" moniker have yielded some "fun to try" beers, but good ol original sumpin' is still sumpin' special.    Poured into a pint glass, it doesn't look that impressive, a medium amber color, lots of bubbles, a small soapy head. It's not Lagunitas' most impressive smelling beer either, a quick shot of hops and pine, anD then, boozy alcohol tingles.     But we drink beer with our mouths. And lil' sumpin' delivers. Great mouthfeel, substantial, but clean, and the carbonation makes this 7.5 very drinkable. The taste is great, hop forward, with bread malts and a bit of warm alcohol on the tail end. Clean finish, with a slight lingering (but pleasant) bitterness.    This is an excellent American hoppy wheat ale...highly reccomended.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Before knowing exactly what I was drinking, assumed this beer was an unusually balanced IPA. Definite hoppiness, citrus, grapefruit and pine with a pleasant bitterness, IBU 64. Paralleled with smooth, sweet wheat aroma and taste that linger in the palette. An easy drinker, smooth, balanced, and delicious. At 7.5%, this hoppy wheat ale will get you there in couple. Easily one of my recent favorites from lagunitas, a welcome shift from their IPA I usually get. Will be enjoying again.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Out of the bottle boured a medium copper, fitered clear, with a white frothy persistent head. Immediately hit with fruity hops evoking notes of pineapple, mango and peach, also resinous pine, and a relatively moderate caramel malt backbone. On the palate more fruit replays with peach perceived more as sweet canned peaches. Pleasnt lingering hop bitterness balanced with the malt. Rich and refreshing.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 L: Pale amber color. Large foamy white head.    S: Very hoppy nose. I get pineapple and grapefruit aromas.     T: Lots of citrus flavors up front. Some malt and bitterness in the finish.    F: Very smooth and refreshing.     O: I am a big fan of this style, and this is the best hoppy wheat I have had thus far. I am a "ticker" for the most part and don't go out of my way to try most beers more than once, but this is one I will have to come back to.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale  (ABV: 7.5%) (IBU: 65)    This category of an American pale wheat ale is essentially an American rendition of a Hefeweizen/Weissbier.   The style belends the best charactersitics of pale ales and wheat beers allowing for a blast of American centered hops with an apparent level of sweetness from the grains used in the brewing process. The combination of these 2 styles allow for a complex blend of flavors and aromas to emerge from the glass.    AROMA - orange and lemon peel zest, mild grapefruit presence, grassy earthyness, light caramel notes, smells like an IPA with its powerful hop aromas    APPEARANCE – clear honey amber hue, bright white thick head, dense streaks of lacing     FLAVOR – dominating hop characteristics ranging from floral/piney to citrus hoppiness, ruby grapefruit zest, honey sweetness, lemon and oragne zest, slight hints of bread with a light wheat finish,    MOUTHFEEL – silky smooth, crisp carbonation with slight dryness mid-palate, soft bready finish,     OVERALL – this is the definition of a hoppy wheat beer; whenever you find the word "American" in the beer's style category you can almost guarantee an immense hop presence, hop heads will enjoy this wheat ale deviation from their classic hoppy IPA's. This pale wheat ale is more along the lines of an American IPA style with a touch of wheat, which is completely fine.    In fact, on the bottle's label it notes the ingredients are: Hops, malt, hops, yeast, hops, water and hops. Sensing a dominating ingredient at all? Nonetheless, a delicious hybrid combination of hop profiles with slight honey sweetness and touch of grain.

look: 2.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.5 12oz bottle into am IPA glass. Slightly cloudy, pale yellow in color. Aroma is dark and dank, causing expectations of a fine IPA. Taste is way different than the smell. Yeasty and "wheaty" up front with a hoppy/yeasty finish. Lightly carbonated for a light mouthfeel. Overall, somewhat disappointing. From the aroma, was expecting something more juicy and hoppy but was left disappointed.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I like that I can get this beer relatively fresh in the middle of nowhere. Pours a yellow color with some cloudiness that shows off the 50% wheat grain bill. Very enjoyable C hop aroma, you definitely can make a nice aromatic beer with C hops despite some often prevalent subjective wisdom running contrary to that thought.    Plenty of good green vegetal C hop goodness in the taste, bitter but not overly. Mouthfeel really does wheat beers well, nice and light, dry body that really lets the hops shine.     Easily top 1st tier wheat beer, done very well, better than almost any other I can think of. Easy availability will hurt its score on the BA top beers board, not rare enough, but to those who aren't into Pokemon level stuff, this really satisfies taste buds and the wallet. Sorry, no fedex bux here.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Enjoying a glass of this in-tap at Lou Malnati's pizzeria in Chicago while I wait for the pizza to arrive. Served in paint glass, this beer is a vey clear, medium golden color with a white head that's about half an inch thick when first served. Head settles pretty quickly to a medium sized ring lining the inside of the glass. Barely any lacing to speak of. Aromas of slightly toasted, somewhat biscuity, caramel malt notes and certainly some wheat, rounded out with a bit if hops. The taste pretty. Much follow suit with slightly atoasted, biscuity, fairly mildly sweet caramel malt presence along with some wheat notes that give way to n earthy, slightly citrusy, floral hop presence. Good balance of flavors. Has a very crisp, slightly prickly, somewhat smooth and frothy medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish. Beau to drink in a good way.    Eric

Both the hoppiness and the mouthfeel remind me more of a hoppy amber or a hoppy brown (DFH Indian Brown?), and that's a good thing. There's a real kick to this, and I got a kick out of it.

Good carbonation and lacing.     S: Powerful aroma, with an upfront hop presence, with some pine and a little bread. Gets your attention quickly!    T: Very nicely balanced between the hop, wheat and malt. The hops linger in the aftertaste, but not in a bad way.    F: Extremely Smooth finish. Creamy and full without being overly thick.    O: Becoming one of my favorite beers, especially if Safeway continues its $15/twelve pack deal.. Very smooth and drinkable, which can be a little dangerous at 7.5% ABV   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Fair warning; I'm rating this beer after having a couple. Lagunitas is fast becoming one of my favorite brands and Little Sumpin' Sumpin' is a wonderfully pleasing ale. It has an excellent balance of hops citrus flavor and light body. The bitterness is mild and the finish it smooth. I will have this one again. Cheers!

A bleached white head of densely packed foam rests on the surface with a depth of 1 cm and slowly fades to a sturdy surface layer. Some tight lattice on the sides of the glass. The aroma is generally sweet and fruity with orange and lemon notes and a bit of a floral presence.  First sip reveals alight to average body with fine and tingly carbonation. Beer slides down my belly very easily after each sip.  Flavor is a bit of grainy malt and some wheat twang but moves to a bitey grapefruit rind flavor that lingers on my tongue after each sip. I dont get any hints of the booze and the beer is very easy to drink and is quite refreshing as I take each swallow. Burps are hoppy with pine and grapefruit showing up again.  This is a crisp refreshing beer that I am enjoying and I would recommend to folks that like the lighter body of a wheat ale with some solid hop character and complexity.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bottle into a weizen glass.    What a great wheat ale! The most hop delivery I've experienced without any unpleasant bitterness or aftertaste.  Had this early in my "career" and was a bit overwhelmed by the grapefruitiness, but revisiting it was the right choice.    Pours clear and brassy with a one-finger creamy head. That pillow of creamy foam sticks around til the end and coats the glass like crazy.  A soothing but powerful big grapefruit aroma with sweet pineapple.  Taste is in-your-face huge with a sweet mix of floral citrus and grapefruit. Some bitterness at swallow sticks around, but is mellow against the sweet hop zing and nice malty, wheat grain finish.  A smooth feeling drink that's moderately carbonated.

Citrus and tobacco mingled with peppercorns. Medium mouthfeel... a little bit sticky. Dry and hoppy on the finish.    O: Another great beer from Lagunitas. The hoppy wheat whatchamacallit works very well. This is one of those 'will drink any time' kinds of brews.

"A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale"  12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, production coded but without freshness dating    "A Little Sumpin' Sumpin'" is another one of those beers that has always just slipped by me without my ever getting around to reviewing it. As I've come across these beer (there have been many) I've noticed three thing: 1) they tend to be beers that I'd consider standbys, and 2) perhaps because of that they tend to be beers that I drink on tap (I don't generally like to review beers in bars and only do it when I have to). Finally, I usually assume that I've already reviewed them because I drink them so much! All of those thing go towards suggesting that they're great beers.     Let's get the easy stuff over quick: mainly clear deep gold body, frothy/creamy off-white head, excellent head retention, very good lacing. Medium body with a fine-bubbled standard carbonation.    The aroma is bright and fresh, but not overtly bold. It's floral and citrusy with Sanguinely orange, soft grapefruit, and a very slight bit of pine over a sweetish, biscuity/bready malt base.    The flavor isn't much different, and what makes the beer work so well is its balance. It's soft and supple, yet hoppy and strong. Everything melds together in one round ball. It's fruity, then more piney/herbal hoppy and malty, and finally bitter and drying in the finish with a little spritz of alcohol.     Straddling the line between a being an amped up American pale ale and an American IPA, "Little Sumpin' Sumpin'" delivers. Remarkably enjoyable, and drinkable.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 This a great looking beer. It reminds me of an ice-cream malt. Tall, creamy head with a sold gold color and small carbonation bubbles. The aroma is citrusy with hints of grapefruit. The flavor is sweet and fruity and reminds of orange and grapefruit. It is punctuated with a quick and diluted bitterness that rounds out the strong flavors. The alcohol taste is imperceptible. The mouthfeel is probably the best part. It is robust and interestingly textured at first and becomes something akin to flat soda as it washes down. Fantastic. An excellent summer ale.

The color is a slightly hazy orange with a thick white head and beautiful lacing. I tasted distinct citrus notes most notably orange with possibly some subtle grapefruit back notes. While I'm generally not a fan of overly hoppy beers this was very pleasant and I felt well balanced.

It can be alot larger if poured more agressively. The body has a yellow/orangish color with a slight haze and no sediment at the bottom. There is carbonation thoughout the glass and tons of white snowy lacing.  Nose: You get pine, citrus, and grapefruit mainly.   Taste: I tasted grapefruit, citrus, apricot(once it is warmer) and tropical fruits. You can expect bitter hops that is farely present on the aftertaste. The alcohol is not extremely noticeable for the 7.5% ABV's.   moulthfeel: light and crisp  Overall: It is really not that cloudy for a wheat ale, but it is a pale wheat ale, so maybe that is why. Anytime it is a beer with wheat in it I would like to see some chunky sediment in there, but I can't complain because I always enjoy this ale. It is always consistent whether it's had in the bar, or at home in the bottle. It satisfies the craving for a light bodied beer that has hop bitterness, without being overly bitter. It is fruity without being too sweet and still tastes like beer. How do they do it? Lil' Sumpin' Sumpin' is the best of it's kind for sure!

A delicious honeyed malt flavor leads the taste; I'm surprised how delicate the hops are given their prominence in the nose and the label's report of 64.20 IBU. The honey and fruit guide the flavor and the hops are always present but never interrupt, never overwhelm, never seem out of balance. Mouthfeel clean. What a surprise.    Brown bottle poured into a glass. Did not see a date on the bottle, but if it were fresher it would only be better, I suppose.

While this is good beer and it went well with a greasy pizza, I had Allagash's White next to it. And Sumpin' is over-rated in my book. While the wheat softens both beers, nothing will ever soften the hops in Sumpin'.  Dropped my rating considerably when you think that a beer's role is more than to cut the grease from a bad pizza.  I like lagunitas as a company, but only a few select beers of theirs thrill a malt- head like me.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Into a pint glass, it poured a very bright and clear golden orange with a minimal, soft white head.   The smell is awesome.  The nose is packed up front with light fruit/citrus, slightly earthy hop notes, fruity esters, and malt sweetness.   The bitterness is quite nice against the malt, very smooth. The hop flavor follows with the nose in a fruit/citrus direction with light lingering bitterness. There is a sweet, grainy malt flavor with a taste of wheat that props itself right up next to the hops. Although the taste of the yeast is rather neutral, the fruit-like esters provide another level of flavor and enjoyment.   It has a relatively light mouthfeel, carbonation is about normal.   I thoroughly enjoy this brew!   One of my favorites from Lagunitas and a very drinkable beer.   Cheers!

It smells of malt, grapefruit, pine, honey, and floral hops. The taste is much maltier than I anticipated but in a good way. The taste also features grapefruit, pine, caramel, and hops. The balance between malt and hop is outstanding This ale is medium-bodied, lightly carbonated, and with an ABV of 7.5%, it is very easy to drink. Overall, this is an outstanding ale, deserving of its excellent rating and reputation. You can drink this one casually or accompanying a hearty meal. It's outstanding!

Felt malt-heavy in flavor and feel and the thickness on display here was unwelcome rather than rich. I was getting some tropical fruit flavor and aroma (as a matter of fact a good amount on the aroma) but a few sips in I just wanted the Born Yesterday rather than this. This just feels clunky and burly by comparison and without the pop or flavor dynamic.     It doesn't help that I couldn't for the life of me figure out the date this was bottled. An old Lagunitas complaint.

There are sweet wheat notes as well, though they are very mild  T: Hops once again are most prominent, definitely resinous in character, somewhat floral as well. However, these bitter aspects are perfectly rounded out by a nice sweet character from the malts used. Well balanced flavor  F: Super solid, very silky and smooth, carbonation is medium and crisp. Goes back easy and has a nice bite of bitterness.  O: Great beer. Hops are a little 1 note but I like the idea behind this beer and found it quite enjoyable.

Mild, small bubbles rising. Very nice, thick lacing down the glass.  AROMA: A mix of big piney notes and caramel malt. Maybe some citrus rind lurking far in the background.  TASTE: I would say just as described in the aroma. Good balance between sweet and bitter. Mild building bitterness over the course of the beer.  FEEL: Medium body, smooth on the palate. A little slick up front, drying on the finish. Carbonation is medium full.  OVERALL: I like big pine notes and a nice sweet malt balance, so this one is a winner, to me.

Taste Is not as good as the smell here but still pretty darn good, a lot more bitter than expected can really taste the hops, and I think the over riding taste is partially fermented apples. Mouthfeel is typical of an IPA, can't even taste the 7.5 percent truly dangerous on a mid Summer's night ha.   Overall a great offering that's offered even at local grocery stores with minimal selection. Would reccomend 4/5

I've had less bitter IPAs than this, but it was still enjoyable, although it seemed like one regardless.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a bottle dated December 18th, 2015 I believe (352 5, Julian-dating). Yellow gold, slightly pale wheat beer look, a little opaque with a bright white foam that lingers. Smell is very hoppy, resinous citrus and pine, just a little creamy textured. Taste is on point with the smell but a bit more relaxed, with a cool, refreshing wheat backbone that is almost equally as apparent as the mellow but potent hoppy flavors. Very drinkable sessiony ale, interesting take on both IPA and wheat styles with a bit of a dominant IPA character. White lacing stacking up the glass. Cheers.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Looks great, golden. Fluffy white head. Smells amazing, it's been a while since I've had a wheat, my favorite style, so this smell has me super excited. So crisp.   It tastes American. Kind of pale, kind of spicy, tied loosely together by its yeast. I think I could call this a session beer. The carbonation is enjoyable in a strange way with this one.

Pours a beautiful amber color with a thick head that retains it's wonderful pine and citrus aroma. Taste mimics aroma with a slight sweetness. I first had this one on one of the hottest days last summer and fell in love with it. Just had another tonight, Feb. 20th and it was just as good. It is just a very fine unpretentious beer that has never left me bored. Every time I drink one it is like anew. Complex in its simplicity.

Appearance: It poured a nice clear clean golden copper colour with a one finger off white head that stuck around for a while and left some nice lacing.    Aroma: Strong grapefruit, pine and mandarin with a hint of bready wheat malt sweetness. There’s also a hint of lime.    Taste: Grapefruit, lemon zest and pine bitterness with orange, mandarin and light honey sweetness. The finish is a light bitterness.    Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with medium carbonation.    Overall: This was not bad but perhaps started out a little on the sweet side for me. I didn’t get much of the wheatiness though, but the lightly bitter finish was nice.

I would consider it a golden-style india pale ale, as the color is bright yellow and has a butter and biscuit taste. Great mixture of sappy pine notes with citrus flavor as well. This one goes down easy, and also has a nice ABV at 7.5%.

Taste: Very much like the nose. Tasty.    Mouthfeel: a bittersweet aftertaste lingers.     Overall: a very nice, easily accessible beer.

Color honey amber with a dash of orange.  S: Grapefruit, tangerines, and sourdough bread. Not getting much of the pine that others have described, compared to an IPA.  T: Heavy on the hops for a Pale Ale. Well-balanced and full, with fruit up front and some somewhat bitter pine, grass and spice in the back end. Can just barely taste the wheat. Every sip makes me want more.  M: Medium-bodied and smooth. Tingles all the way down. Refreshing to the end.  O: One of my favorite all-around beers, enjoyable for hopheads and wheat-lovers alike.

The reason I gave its looks such high marks is in the little things, the head looked very dense and sticky, the rush of bubbles; it was all very appealing.     S: This worried me when I first opened the bottle. There was a very strong pine smell, I was expecting a more balanced beer since it is a wheat ale but it smelled almost like an IPA. On the whole though the sent was well done: pine, maybe grass, plus grapefruit and other citrus and fruit with a slight hint of bread. Not what I expected, but good.    T: Much more balanced then the scent implied. There is a large amount of hops up front, not to bitter but they still make a statement. This is followed by citrus fruits, and at the end the wheat and bread flavors, though these were the weakest overall.     M: Well carbonated giving a thick frothy feel. The tingle of the bitter hops can be felt on the tongue. It finishes smooth leaving a pine/citrus aftertaste. Very refreshing.    O: While I am not a big fan of hoppy beers and I was not expecting so much hops in this one in particular, I found myself really enjoying this beer. It was balanced and refreshing, there was a good complexity to the flavors and they matched nicely together. I certainly would recommend this beer with the caveat that one should be prepared for a lot of hops and a hint of wheat, which is actually not a bad combo.

Bright citrus hop aroma. Lemon, grapefruit, and bitter orange. Light wheat malt and biscuit.    Wheat comes through stronger on tongue than the nose. Biscuit and dough. Grapefruit hops. More citrus in the form of lemon, orange rind, and nectarine.    Smooth mild mouth feel with good hop bite. Medium carbonation. Citrus lingers. Just the right amount of bitterness.    Big citrus with good malt balance. Drinks like a light IPA more than a wheat ale.

While it's somewhat mass produced and available everywhere, that a good thing for all.

Left a lot of lacing and a thin layer of foam on top that lasted til the end. Smell was a little off putting (my bottle was undated, could have been old). Smelled a little like Lysol mixed with rubbing alcohol. There was definitely an unpleasant alcohol burn that tasted a little like rubbing alcohol, also. I realize this is a little higher than average ABV than a typical beer, but at the same time, I've had equally high ABV beers without that taste. If I looked past the alcohol burn, the beer was great; balanced with just the right amount of hops and citrusy flavors. I don't think it's quite as good as others here say, but it was okay. I'd be willing to try it again and see if my bottle really was bad.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Poured this beer into a weizen glass creating a 3 inch head with nice retention and lacing down the whole side of the glass that pretty much stayed there as I drank this beer. Aroma is all hops. There is wheat breadiness and sweetness somewhere in there but the hops takes over. Taste is basically all hops front, middle and back. The good part is that the hops is very balanced. Not too much and does not stay on the palate too long. The part that may not appeal to everyone is that the hops basically takes over the whole thing. Wheat beers are pretty mild so throwing so much hoppy flavor in there basically makes this a one-note type deal. Solid drinking beer just not enough complexity for me.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Aroma of citrussy, grassy hops. A bit tropical. Somewhat sweet smelling. Fresh bread malt aroma. Pine needles, grapefruit, and a little honey.    Pours clear light amber with an off-white head. Decent retention and good lacing.    Juicy citrus fruits on the palate. Marmalade and pine. Floury wheat flavor rounds things off. Some sweetness upfront, honey-like. Finishes fairly dry though.    Crisp medium body, medium carbonation. Mouthfilling but not cloying. Some hop resin lingers with some floury wheat.    Drinks more like an IPA with notable wheat flavor. Not complaining though.

I'm not even sure what food one could pair this with - it's a bit on the sticky side    O: it's halfway to a double IPA - just label it so... even at 2.5 months old, this IS showing age, for sure... it's a fine hoppy beer, but it almost seems like a potluck(?), scratch recipe... this has to be one of the beers (first time having this in years) from Lagunitas that initial turned me off on this brewery (Sucks regained my attention)... really a trash IPA w/ no personality - an uncomfortably drunk party guest that passes out, flopping down on the dumpy couch that is your tastebuds

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This beer pours a crystal clear bright golden orange color with a 2 finger bright white head. There is good retention throughout and not much lacing. Smell is lemon, floral, pineapple, grassiness, and pine. Taste is the same with moderate bitterness. Feel is light, crisp and well carbonated. Overall this beer is complex yet suble. Too subtle for my liking, but very drinkable.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 DATE TASTED: December 4, 2015 ... GLASSWARE: Brew at the Zoo pint... OCCASION: watching the Cavs/Pelicans with a second rating in one night... APPEARANCE: a bronze, sparsely effervescent body; head is off-white, crowning with bubbly froth and a quarter-finger showing.... AROMA: at first, a noticeably light, aromatic hops bomb of Cascade, Centennial, and Columbus hops... some definitive pungent wheaty yeasts dampen the aroma... PALATE: medium-bodied, worthwhile mouthfeel with enough warming weight to suggest its 7.5% ABV...a lasting, pleasant aftertaste...a bit crunchy, and engaging...TASTE:the label claims simplicity, and the taste profile approximates its promise, with a yeasty oddity pushed upward by a hoppy citrus juiciness... a bit of spruce tip ends up in this as well... OVERALL: as promised, a beer that tantalizes and pleases in equal measure... another beer that I (embarrassingly, finally) sampled at Tom's beer fest last week... Lagunitas delivers again....
