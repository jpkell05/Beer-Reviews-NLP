look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 2017 version - pours a dark ruby brown colour with 1/2 finger tannish head.   Aroma slightly spicy bourbon, toffee, touch of booziness; hints of peat and smoke.   Taste starts malty and sweet with caramel, dark fruits, molasses, and bourbon/scotch, but the a touch more of the oak, peaty flavour with accumulation of bitterness.  The peaty bitterness carries to a rich smooth and malty slightly boozy finish.  Thick rich mouthfeel with slight astringent effec, but pleasantly so. Really tasty.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 Pours a very deep deep brown, black in the right lighting, but with a very faint reddish glow from beneath. A finger of light tan foam rests atop an obviously viscous body. Sticky.     Nose: On the nose, first and foremost is a rich sticky caramel malt sweetness. There are wisps of notes one might expect from a Highland whisky dram, like apple, orange peel, dried cherry, fig, raisin, plum, and the oak. Unfortunately, I pick up no smoke or peat notes. Something I was particularly excited for. The caramel, vanilla, oak, and even slight molasses aromas register more as bourbon to me. Still, smell is rich and dense, and sweet. Quite similar to Curmudgeon's Better Half, and it should make sense that it smells like bourbon. It's not aged in Scotch barrels, it's aged in bourbon barrels.    Palate: Opens up sweet and malty with thick caramel, toffee, vanilla, cherry, prune, a touch of chocolate, hint of molasses - and then shifts to drier, woody notes, oak, leather, and then shifts slightly bitter into lots of barrel char and, yes, a nice little wisp of smoke in the finish. The bourbon, barrel char, and smoke become more prominent the more you drink, and start to linger longer, balancing out the sweetness a little bit, and becoming almost tannic. You begin to think it's actually the sweetness that's balancing out the ever-growing bitterness. It's not too much, but it's right on the line.     Mouthfeel: This ale is just amazing thick, sticky, viscous, and slick, while both leaving a coating in your mouth, and a drying finish with the charry notes. It's awesome. That feeling when you imagine that perfectly thick, chewy, gooey dessert beer, and you're NOT let down. Nectar.     Overall: This is a good (not so) wee heavy ale. No, it's a fantastic one. There's a lot going on, and it's bold and impressive, and makes a name for itself. I wish the bitter charry finish was a little toned down, letting some more of the smoke and nuance come through, as it becomes a bit aggressive after a while, but then again, maybe it would be too sweet without the bitter balcony point? Who knows. I'd have preferred to see this aged in Islay (or at least some kind of) Scotch barrels, opposed to bourbon, but hey. What can you do? This isn't perfect, but compared to its stylistic counterparts, it stands steadfast and true. A must try.

Six years old and aged to perfection. A lovely amber color with foam that kicked up an inch. Flavor was beautiful with melow bourbon flavors. Overall outstanding.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 355 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before Jul 20 2018 (2017 batch, 11.1%) and served slightly chilled. Not the ideal candidate for review (given its age), but what're ya gonna do - I'm just trying to clean my cellar out.    Pours a very dark mahogany brown colour, with ruby red highlights and some flocculence. One finger of frothy, tan-coloured head rises to the surface, lasting for no more than 90 seconds as it quickly wilts down to a soapy collar of bubbly foam. The scattered lines of lacing are a bit scant, but it looks good otherwise. Straight-up bourbon whiskey is by far the most noticeable element of the aroma - bold and unrelenting, with oak wood, vanilla, treacle and toffee adding some depth to the nose. The alcohol fumes are also difficult to miss, though the opposite is true of its hints of date, raisin and chocolate.    A beast of a beer, of that there can be no doubt; the bourbon whiskey remains dominant, with rich dark malt flavours of treacle, toffee and toasted nuts also coming through in force. Fruity notes of date and raisin crop up by mid-sip, with barrel character of oak and vanilla not far behind. Finishes herbal and a little spicy, with suggestions of black cherry and butterscotch coming through at the beginning of a long, shamelessly boozy aftertaste that includes some charred wood flavour. Full-bodied, with low carbonation levels that barely register; feels smooth and soft on the palate, with (slight) numbing and warming effects from the ethanol. Reasonably drinkable, perhaps even dangerously so.    Final Grade: 4.13, an A-. Backwoods Bastard is not a subtle beer, but that shouldn't come as a shock to those who are familiar with Founders' BA series. Honestly, I think I'd take Dirty Bastard over this BBA variant, nine times out of ten - though to be fair, I don't love bourbon, I merely tolerate it - and this is the very definition of a bourbon bomb, with the spirit totally overwhelming the base wee heavy. If that's what you're in the mood for, then look no further, I guess - but if you're like me, this beer will serve as more of an interesting diversion vs. a mind blowing must-try. Worth a go if you can find it... I'll update this review as needed, if I stumble upon a fresh bottle.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 A beautiful dark beer whose appearance is only held back by the lack of head retention. An incredibly smooth sip with some bourbon bite on the backend that makes for a delicious sipping brew. Not a beer that I would buy all of the time due to its strong nature, but one that I still seriously enjoyed and would drink from time to time.

The bourbon is strong and very forward, but then you get a nice sweetness of caramel/maple syrup, with a noticeable lingering bourbon after taste with a bit of bitter abv. A very nice style, perfect for the end of a chilly day working outside and relaxing.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 2017 Release.    This beer pours a deep rusty brown, murky and dark, but with a reddish hue that you can spot in certain lighting. The head is about two and a half fingers thick, frothy and leaving small archipelagos of lace around the glass as it settles.    Sweet, dark fruit, oak, malt, and molasses greet the nose. It’s got a subtle but present peat and as it warms, hints of chocolate as well. At first I wasn’t a huge fan of the nose , but as it warms I really get a well-balanced complexity that only improves with every sip.    For 11+%, I expected a heavier, more in-your-face flavor profile. Granted, this is 2017’s release, so it seems that time has only mellowed this beer. Peat, malt, bitter fruit, booze, and light hops characterize a beer that functions well together as a whole, but I expected just a little more when combining the complimentary oak bourbon barrels and scotch ale style.    Smooth, medium mouthfeel. A fairly low but apparent carbonation. Smooth, warm, and not overly boozy. Sticky finish.

Rich. complex malt flavors explode in the first sip. Peaty, roasty, turbinado sugar, vanilla all in the mix. Oakiness and warming alcohol in the back. Ripe berries and cocoa too. Full bodied with light, creamy carbonation. Light bitterness and thick maltiness in the finish. Alcohol heft is understated throughout.    A fantastic Wee Heavy, a celebration of malts. Juicy and complex. A must try world class beer.

A finger of head was produced that did not produce any lace but retained exceptionally well.    Smell: Very potent, but I don't think I am a fan of what this brew portends. In particular I pickup a strong molasses note, powerfully roasted malt and a solvent like quality that comes from a high alcohol brew that doesn't hide that fact well. Warming brings it out more, but it is completely irrelevant as it's strong at time of pour.    Taste: Shortbread and toffee malt starts us out masterfully as there is just the right amount of underlying sweetness, it continues to build with a slight charred oak hit with hints of raisins. Sadly while doing so, what I feared creeps into the beer, a powerful alcohol twang that punctuates the beer with some earthy hops giving it a very strong whiskey like note. Don't get me wrong, it's still good, but that undisguised alcohol should either be concealed or embraced without as much sweetness to start.    Mouthfeel: As stated, it has a solvent quality to it that is undesirable to me, unless you are really playing up the scotch and whiskey aspect. This one does at the end, but certainly doesn't at the start. That leads me to my biggest issue with the beer, it's transitioning, and it's not too often I encounter this problem (because most brewers don't seem to be able to pull it off). Most times when I take issue with transitioning, it's because the beer doesn't go from one flavor to another in a smooth fashion. That it feels either rocky or a 90 degree turn. I don't get that here, as it seems to make it journey from almost excessively sweet, to boozy, bitter, charred whiskey in a fairly graceful fashion. The issue is that it's simply too far a spectrum in such a short period of time. It's like a one day cruise. Sure, it's nice and I get to my destination, but it seems like the cruise was a waste and I could have flown for cheaper. Anyways, the carbonation is good and the aftertaste is still a bit boozy and cloyingly sweet.    Drinkability: Not as heavy as I would expect from something this boozy, but just on the heavier end of medium bodied. It's not quite a meal, but would say an appetizer for sure. Not exactly what I could call refreshing, but Scotch ale doesn't usually fill that niche. I like that it avoids dry aspects but I'm not a big fan of the feeling it leaves.    Final Thoughts: When I drank this, my mind actually wandered to a quote from a Sherlock Holmes adventure. I decided to look it up. It was from "The Adventure of the Norwood builder" where Holmes explaining how he caught the criminal in this adventure said "But he had not that supreme gift of the artist, the knowledge of when to stop." which pretty much echoes my sentiment on a lot of beer from the US (apart from the tried and true stereotype that macro lager is water, but I digress). This beer I feel perfectly expresses that sentiment. There is such an extreme transition here, that it comes across as drowning out it's own substance. Cranking the volume to 11 often deafens the listener to the music. Pretty much, the niche of this beer is after dinner in the fall or winter instead of whisky, because dinner wasn't substantial enough. As good as this beer is, it's far too small a niche for my liking.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 1.5 | feel: 2.25 | overall: 1.5 I was very disappointed by this beer and was not even able to finish it. I am a huge fan of Founders and especially of their Dirty Bastard, so I figured that I would naturally enjoy the Backwoods Bastard. I was incorrect. The scotch flavor was so overpowering that I could not enjoy it, and it tasted nothing like beer.    With all the positive reviews, I wonder now if there was something wrong with the one I was served. If someone offers me one in the future, I would be willing to give it another try and modify my review if it was different. But as it stands, I can't recommend this to anyone who wants a drinkable beer.

This beer has a great price point at around $14/4pk and drinks best at about the 2-3yr mark. This beer is pretty hot and not great fresh, and so I'd definitely recommend some time on it. Other than Lagunitas' High West-ified, this is probably the best BA value you can find, and definitely my favorite from Founder's offerings. So happy they made this available year round! I stocked up and so should you.

Tastes of heavy malty syrupy malts with some fruity and spicy notes, and light hops. Very chewy mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. There is no doubt that this is a very well made beer. But it is a little too syrupy sweet and malty for my taste. It could stand a few more hops and a little less malts. Still, a very good beer, but one at a time is enough to satisfy you for a while. Would not recommend this for a session beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Vintage 2016 (bottled on 10/6/16)    Look: deep amber-brown with a short-lied but beautiful off-white head; lots of lacing follows each sip    Smell: lightly charred oak chips tossed with dark fruit strike first, synchronizing perfectly with the oncoming bourbon and vanilla     Taste: the more decadent side of the fruits and bourbon arrive, but never become too cloying amongst scotch notes which have now become firmly established as the backbone of the flavor profile; an unexpectedly savory dark chocolate finish also presents itself on occasion     Feel: so smooth and creamy, and there really is no trace of alcohol in this    Overall: this is almost stunningly well-structured, and the 1.5 years of aging has only seemed to reveal the nuance in this beer's myriad of flavor even further. I'm usually one for more of a bite to my higher ABV brews, but the character shown in this one despite the lack of a kick just can't be ignored; I'm no expert on the style by any means, but it's tough to imagine another scotch ale topping this, at least in terms of flavor and mouthfeel.

I was super excited when I saw this was waiting for me at home. Cracking this bottle has a slow eruption of foam that requires quick thinking to get it in the glass.    Appearance - Pours clear and the darkest shade of ruby I've ever seen. Near black unless held up to natural light when a mahogany and ruby mixture appears again. Capped with two fingers of yellowy tan head, pretty decent retention, curtains of lacing stick to the glass.    Smell - Oh Yeah! Single malt whiskey is apparent on the nose, with toffee and butterscotch, figs, raisins and dates, with hints of oak as well as bourbon. Complex, inviting, everything good it's got in spades. Smells like a boozy Christmas cake too.    Taste - Hard to describe since there's so much going on. Initially sweet with toffee and butterscotch and caramel, followed by a hit of booze (bourbon mostly). Some earthy hops shine through momentarily before oak and whiskey come through to enhance the middling bitterness. Figs and raisins are interspersed. If I have a complaints it's the the full breadth of flavors don't linger on the plate quite as long as I'd hoped, because they are some delicious flavors.    Mouthfeel - Carbonation is present, but super smooth and sticky, this slides down the throat way too easily. A nice little whiskey burn at the end, but luscious, thick and slick.     Overall - Yeah, this is about as good as a wee heavy can get, loads of flavor, amazing aromatics and a feel to die for. The only thing I'm missing is smoke, but with some high quality whiskey flavors in there, I can live without the smoke, I might try this a bit colder to see how the flavors change while warming up, but hats off to FOunders on creating a near perfect Wee Heavy.

Rich, creamy smooth feel up front followed by pleasant boozy warmth through the finish. Medium high, boozy bourbon flavors with sweet dark and toasted malt flavors. Medium light, earthy hop bitterness through the middle is difficult to distinguish from the prickly, boozy bite. Dark malt with dark caramel notes on the back end with hints of dark toasted crust. Finished with mellow, sweet, boozy bourbon notes, hints of vanilla and earthy dark malt. Although I am not a bourbon drinker, this was pretty tasty. Definitely a sipper. Malt character was able to show through just enough to balance the boozy scotch presence. Fabulous feel , with pleasant warmth.

The head is a nice half finger, colored a hazelnut brown. The lacing is absolutely superb, very thick.    Smell - First note for me is strong oaked bourbon, but there are subtle hints of vanilla here as well. A bit of sweet fruit comes through as well, most likely raisins.    Taste - The immediate flavor is strong bourbon, has that nice spiced bite at the back of the throat as well. Subtle hints of cherry and vanilla.    Feel - Full bodied and chewy. Not overly thick and actually has a little bit of carbonation which works great here.    Overall - This is a fantastic scotch ale, great oaked bourbon flavor with a nice spicy kick complimented with sweet raisins and molasses. Definitely a slow sipper, hints of vanilla and spice really play up as the beer warms.

Taste complex and fantastic, low carbonation. Brown sugar, some fruit I can't put my finger on maybe dark cherry, roasted and caramelized malt, a hint of bitter chocolate perhaps. Touch of caramel in every sip. And of course the bourbon! It is not overly boozy, just a friendly reminder. Made for the perfect dessert beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Dark orange-brown colour, pouring with acidity and a decent head.  Smells of bourbon, caramel and fermented grapes.  The taste is surprising, with a mellow sweet initial sensation, hiding some dark fruits, honey, sweet cherries with some fermented fruits. The woody, oak whiskey barrel scents are leaving their mark, after which a really dry feel on the palate is covering everything and a lingering alcoholic feel, like after a bourbon is leaving you the sensation that you forgot what was in the glass.  Very interesting and well-crafted beer, but somehow the aftertaste is leaving room for improvement.

This drinks like a Bourbon and it is my favorite Bourbon barrel aged beer yet. It tastes like someone mixed two fingers of Buffalo Trace with something between a scottish ale and a light thin stout.    The nose is good, but not great. It's lighter than I expected for something so dark. The initial flavors to me are dark red berries mixed with brown sugar and vanilla. Lots of that Bourbon influence coming through. A little smokiness and a tart flavor at the end.    Really good stuff.

The nose was bourbon, chocolate, and a little smoke. This brew is complex to say the least, malty, bready, black cherry, and of course bourbon notes took turns throughout. As it warmed a boozy vanilla started to come through. This was a pleasure to drink; boozy yet balanced, and until I sell a kidney and get some KBS, it’s my favorite Founders offering.

Two fingers of loosely packed small bubbled head which produce lazy curtains of foamy blanketing lacing and legs on the swirl.    Smell: Bourbon and vanilla up front dissolves into brown sugar, dates and figs, with a slightly sour, fruity milk chocolate on the back end. This lingering finish is almost like smelling a chocolate covered raspberry. Dark malts and smoky roast comes out as the beer warms.    Taste: Bourbon, vanilla, dark brown sugar, and fruity molasses. This follows with hints of smoky chocolate, tannins, and roasted malt as the beer warms. Very, very drinkable for a big beer.    Feel: This beer initially feels thick and creamy as it enters your mouth, but that's quickly dashed by an effervescent, almost bottle conditioned mouth feel, giving it a quick, smooth finish.    Overall: Very well balanced for such a complex beer. All the notes play perfectly off each other. Just on a side note, this beer actually seemed a little more complex when it is colder.

Intoxicating aroma of bourbon, vanilla, red berries, especially redcurrant, dark fruit: blackcurrant, fig, plum; and bready malt. Taste is incredibly complex, dominated by dark, bready, caramel malts with a lovely, mellow bourbon note and strong notes of vanilla, oak and redcurrant. Notes of toffee, dark fruit, chocolate and smoke as well. Finishes with a great combination of light sweetness, medium bitterness and redcurrant. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel with low carbonisation. An expertly balanced Scotch Ale that is very enjoyable indeed.

Before you start reviewing beers on beer advocate gain some beer drinking experience firs. Alright let's get on with the review folks. The 11% abv is perfectly hidden for the 2017 batch which founders sometimes has problem trying to do but nailed it on the head with this batch. Vanilla, oaky bourbon, maple, sweet malts on the nose and taste. All I can say is if you do not like this brew then you do not like bourbon barrel aged scotch ales. Go back to drinking your cheap corn syrup filled macro lagers if you don't appreciate a well crafted beer like Backwoods Bastard. Cheers! A   
look: 1 | smell: 1 | taste: 1 | feel: 1 | overall: 1 Don't waste your money. Unless you find a ten year old bottle. Hopefully after that long the nasty vanilla flavor has died out. Way too much vanilla. Boulevard BBQ is a good example of a bourbon barrel aged brew.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Bottle - from 4 pack, racking date 5 weeks from tasting according to the date stamp ......pours a lightly hazed medium to dark red amber color with an average, frothy glass-lacing, lasting, beige head. Aroma is intoxicatingly complex and pungent - burnt treacle, oak, vanilla, smoke, caramel, fusel and grassy tones. Flavor is big in front with malts, cocoa, died dark fruits, smoke...gets more complex as it settles on the palate and flavors intermingle earthy caramel tones with roasty vanilla pod notes, light hopping is more herbal than bitter - long wet warming finish as the alcohol is detected for the firs time....rich oily complex character in this finish....first rate barreled strong beer not unlike traditional British strong ales which were hard to tell from barley wines. Great for sipping with a rich desert of a fine Dominican cigar.

Aroma is rather faint compared to an IPA but there is some chocolate and most notably a smooth boozy sweet smell from the bourbon. Wow, I'm going to have to drink this slowly. The first sip hits you with some chocolatey roasted malts but then the bourbon flows in and dominates the end of each sip. That is a kick your ass beer, but the taste is all pleasant as opposed to the harshness of some of the imperial stouts I've had. I'm still not a huge fan of this style, but this one was quite enjoyable.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 12 ounce bottle poured into a Whiskey Snifter. For the start of this, I’ve enjoyed this beer many of times in my past. This is the first time I thought to capture my opinion and overall thoughts of this brew. This Bastard pours a gorgeous color. Deep Amber transparent body that grabs on the level of being Burgundy. This brew is crowned with a deep Khaki soapy Head. Very Impressive to eyes.     The Aroma should dictate where the Bastard is going to lead us. This first grabs your nostrils with a touch of booze and Toasted Grains. Secondary aromas of Caramel and Raisins that have been soaked in Bourbon. A slight buttery note is apparent but not offensive. Very nice!     Da Flavah! This first hits the palate with a semi-sweet Toasted Malt Character. As the Bastard takes his time showing you what he’s about, flavors of Caramel and slight Raisins show up first. Then a splash of the Bourbon Characters come into play. Notes of Char, Cinnamon and Booze play around your tastebuds and compliments the Base Beer nicely. This finishes in a medium Luxury level...neither Rough nor Shallow just right and on time. Booze Bitterness hits as a closer and the aftertaste is where all the flavors come together...Symmetry. The feel of the brew is Medium-light playful body with tight fizzy carbonation.     Overall: This Bastard is an Outstanding Brew! Founders really put some Heart and Soul into the Making of this....Bastard. I appreciate it that they did. All the flavors compliment each other in a unified manner. This brew is both Luxurious and Aggressive at the same time... The only downfall and only “complaint” has to be how the brew feels on the palate (First World Problems, I know). When you have such Amazing flavors going on, you’d expect the feel to be Rich with Accenting Carbonation. It’s a bit lackluster to me... At the end of the day, I’ll still grab this Bastard because he’s an enjoyable Bastard, like an Uncle or Work Mate. All in All this Brew is Recommended!

A premium, hearty, great brew.     Looks dark reddish brown. A thin head.   Smells of creamy chocolate, wood, dried cherries, vanilla, and a hint of almond.   Tastes similar with an enhanced woody bourbon character and a high degree of wafting alcohol.   Feels full bodied, but not too heavy. A little smooth, a little sticky and coating. Quite warming.

Never tried it before and as a follow up to KBS, Breakfast Stout and CBS, I thought "what could go wrong"?  Well, this. This disgusting, brie smelling, bourbon, whiskey-cheese tasting yuckiness. Just gross.   I am not even going to get into anything with this brew, as it truly is for Backwoods Bastards, which I am not.   One of the worst beer I ever had.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Founders produces a lot of good beers. Some of their of their best beers are specialty beers found on tap at their pub in Grand Rapids, MI; however, this is probably the best bottled Scotch Ale I have tasted. It has a robust flavor, a lot of complexity that makes one reluctant to swallow.

The after taste actually reminded me of beercase cheese, which is not a good thing to be reminded of. I've been trying to forget about beercase cheese, and then this brew comes along....    Drinking it is a good experience, with a thick mouthfeel and some nice barrel notes. Flavor is on the bitter, earthy side, especially the finish, with some faint sweet or yeasty undertones. Earthy flavors are what bring-up beercase memories. Beercase also has pooh flavors, not present here, fortunately. In my experience, earthy, while nice in small quantities, is not too difficult to achieve. Just throw some dirt and bark in, and you're going to get earthy. I can like earthy, but I'm not going to think it is amazing.    The image on the label of a backwoods bastard fits rather well with the flavor profile. Did he bathe in the tun?

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Its body is a gorgeous mahogany red that's visible only when held up to the light. It's more of a chestnut brown otherwise. A creamy inch of tan head boasts good retention relative to its ABV.     Big, young bourbon seeps out of the glass. Slow and deep vanilla and oak with heavy caramel. New leather and clean ethanol give it a liveliness. Notes of chocolate pudding and fig newton make it extra dessert-y.     Heaps of gooshy figs and sticky raisins seamlessly meld with creamy oak and vanilla. The bourbon is sanded down, smoothed out and delicate rather than heavy. Creme brulee and round caramel come with a streak of sweet booze. An extra level of ooze comes in the form of molasses and old leather.     There's so much complexity in terms of heavy, deep, rich bourbon and dark fruit flavors yet its body is still able to have a sense of delicacy and neatness. Every component melds together flawlessly. Its chewy and creamy texture is a very enjoyable added bonus. Its 11.2% ABV is found only in its dry finish and lingering warming sensation. It's masterfully hidden in both the aroma and flavor.    Harmony and balance are left in perfect form with its lengthy stay in bourbon barrels. I'm very impressed at how well all of its components come together to make one complex impression with a leveled impression of intensity.

Mouthfeel is a full leaning medium that stops just short of coating the mouth leaving behind a distinct scotch aftertaste.    Overall this is a solid beer from a solid brewery.

Dark brown with a quickly receding beige head. No lacing. Not a remarkable looking brew but I've never bought a beer based on looks.    Smell is phenomenal. Bourbon malts. Unbelievable.    Taste is superb. It's like a bourbon beer. No noticeable hop presence. Malty, bourbon, caramel sweetness with a mild bourbon aftertaste.     Mouthfeel is perfect. Super smooth.     Overall, a wonderful winter time sipper. I highly recommend letting this beer warm. I let it sit out for close to an hour before drinking. I would imagine it's probably around 50 degrees when I drink it. This is a great beer and I'm glad Founders is making it a year round offering.

Look: The beer pours a clear, very dark brown with 5cm of dense, light brown head that dissipates into a craggy cap in 3+ minutes. Great lacing and good overall retention especially given the 11.1% ABV.    Smell: Medium-strong intensity with sweet balance. Rich and complex. Notes of dark fruit (raisins and prunes), milk chocolate, cooked sugar (caramel/toffee), and oak. Slightly vinous with a touch of minerality. The nose is a harmonious mix of fruit, sugar, and barrel-aging all soaked in alcohol – a dessert in a glass!    Taste: Bam! Strong and sweet – though not cloying. Significant oak presence with additional notes of caramel/toffee, milk chocolate, booze, and dark fruit (raisins and prunes). The finish is long, strong, and sweet with pronounced oak and ethanol. Absolutely delicious.     Feel: Full body with mild carbonation. Creamy, thick, and slightly chewy viscosity with notable alcohol warmth. This one has an impressive presence on the palate.    Overall: I love Founders – I haven't yet had a beer by them that I don't adore. A definite sipper, Backwoods Bastard is not for the faint-hearted; it's a punch in the mouth with plenty of alcohol to take you out fast. The brew is very complex in nature and displays excellent craftsmanship. As far as I'm concerned, this is a must try beverage. A companion to sit down and contemplate life with.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25 While reviewing this I poured into a 10oz snifter. I want to give a fair comparison to the first time I had Dirty Bastard on tap.     Look: A very deep amber with a highly retained beige head. Very nice to look at.    Nose: Bourbon, caramel, and orange peel, but mostly bourbon. The nose is nice, but the bourbon drains out the other characteristics I enjoyed from the standard Dirty bastard: butterscotch and caramel in particular.     Taste: Very overpowering bourbon--almost too heavy in my opinion. But, it finishes out with the nice caramel characteristic I remember enjoying from the original. It finishes with the taste of pure alcohol which really isn't my thing. The orange peel doesn't come through.     Mouthfeel: Wonderful. It is medium bodied, creamy, and smooth. Definitely helps with the high bourbon presence.     Overall: A fun beer to try. I enjoy it, but I prefer Dirty Bastard on tap. Bourbon Barrel aged variants tend to be a notch up, but the was the opposite for me unfortunately.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 A nice reddish-Amber color with light tan head, lots of lacing. Nice flavor of bourbon, can be strong if you're not into bourbon, and hints of toffee, maybe some chocolate with a sweet smooth finish.

Very little head, not surprising considering the alcohol content.    Smell is a bit sweet, like caramel. Little fruit as well, and the oak gives it a smell that reminds me a bit of the outdoors.    Lot of caramel and booze up front, seems whiskey like. Picking up fruit notes, mainly cherry. There is an earthines from the oak, and leaves a lingering burn from the alcohol at the finish.    Little on the harsh side, there is a burn to it, but not exactly a bad thing.    Overall a nice diversion, as normally I an inclined towards Belgian beers. This is a nice complex beer, and a good one for a chilly night. If you like a big boozy beer that is also complex, give it a try.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 The beer pours dark reddish brown with just a thin ring of foam. The smell is all oak for me. The taste is oak, nuts and slight fruit, and very well blended. It goes down much lighter and smoother than expected, so be careful with this one. Overall it's a nice beer I hope I find again.

Lots of ooey gooey caramel and milk chocolate.     Highly recommended. I would go out of my way to acquire this beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Shocked! I really wasn't expecting... the smell. Even now, writing this, I'm taking whiffs. When the label says "Backwoods," it's truth in labeling, for sure. Sawdust. Compost? Definitely decay. Dank. Like in the basement of a basement dank. If one really likes the smell of nature - the very earthy, stinky smell of nature, the smell of this beer will do the trick.    I don't think I like the smell. But I'm not sure. I hate to do this, but... you know how if you stick a fingertip in your navel and smell it, you are repulsed and intrigued at the same time? Or... maybe that's just me. if so, never mind.    The look is interesting. Strange lacing like I've never seen before. Spots of lace, like measles, along the glass.    The taste is kind of sweet... at first. And then... maybe liquid compost? It's actually rather complex, but hard to describe. Like the look, it's interesting. Is the flavor good? I'm just not sure. But I'm drinking it, and not inclined to drain pour it.    This beer would go well with watching "Deliverance." I'm not even kidding. Whoever named this beer did so for a pretty good reason. Take a few sips while listening to "Dueling Banjos." This is an ominous beer.

Pours a clear, deep reddish brown with a nice one-finger light tan head, which dissipates fairly quickly with minimal lacing. Initial impression is smoky caramel, vanilla, booze, and a hint of dark fruits. Alcohol is pretty much front-and-center, and unapologetic about it. Somewhat surprisingly, the mouthfeel is fairly hefty and quite smooth despite the ABV. This might be a good cellaring candidate, but I've come to the conclusion that if I only have one bottle I'm gonna drink it fresh. Finish is boozy but clean, with just a hint of residual bitterness. Good sipper.

Opened on 11/2/17    A strange brownish, nearly black looking liquid until you hold it up to some light, then you see it's a very dark red and amber color. Brilliant hues. A small, but full cover of tan colored foam, thick and bubbly.     The aroma is simply unreal in complexity. Large amounts of classicly sweet, caramel and toffee, slightly toasty Scottish malt. Roasty, smokey, maple syrup type sweet effect with a dry, earthy hop thing in the back ground, vanilla oak cask just brings in more layers.     The heavy and thick mouthfeel directly relates to the massive amount of malted barley and the aging techniques on Cask, oak barrels. Campfire style roasty marshmallows, oak wood, dates and peppery herbs over a scotch style whiskey and caramel is easily identified within the malt charecter. The hops give a decent balance of dry/earthy undertones and a bitter bite in the finish.     There's nothing "wee" about this Scottish ale, it's ALL heavy! Fat complexity best left for the professional beer geek/Advocate. This one should come with a warning:, Caution: do not stop on tracks!

S: Right up front with notes of toffee/caramel, woodiness, and light/bright alcohol.   T: I could say that it's right in line with the nose, but that would be a disservice. Backwoods Bastard really knocks it out of the park here. Up front it is a little bittersweet, bourbony, and roasted malt with a vanilla and barrel wood to back it up. The fantastic balance makes it perfect and the bitterness keeps the cloying at bay.   M: Medium/full body with lingering aftertaste. Minimal carbonation which I think could be increased slightly to give it a little more bite.  O: My bottle was almost 2 years old, and from my experience, it's better that way, I'll see how far it can be pushed. Fresh or aged, this beer is still one of the best in my book.

Look: poured into a tulip glass, a deep mahogany with a significant head that holds pretty well and leaves decent lacing. Really nice looking.     Smell: deep bourbon with caramel, dried fruit, maybe some molasses. Malts come through along with a hint of bourbon. Really enticing.    Taste: strong malts, nuts, burnt toffee, bourbon-soaked fruit. A little hop bitterness that’s like oily burnt toast. Mild chocolate, maybe slight smoke or peatiness. Very well balanced and complex taste. I think the aging really smoothed the rougher edges and made the bourbon milder with more malt tones. Highly recommend aging a year. I have a 2015 vintage I can’t wait to try now.     Feel: Rich, thick, much improved from aging. Oily feel instead of alcohol which was sharper when fresh.     Overall, I never thought Backwoods Bastard was all that great, but I had only had it fresh. One year of aging makes this more like Bell’s Black Note, or even Founders CBS, ex the maple, which means this is really good. Highly recommend aging it.    July 2018 Update  Another 2016 bottle so just over a year and a half aging. Very similar to the last review but a little less head and lacing. Maybe a little less fullness in the body. But the flavors are as good or better. Can’t wait to try after two years aging.

Look: Pours dark brown to form a nearly-opaque, almost cola-like body. Minimal off-white head dissipates rapidly to lacing.     Smell: Relatively subdued nose with faint hints of toffee, wood (from the barrel) and bright alcohol ester.     Taste: This is where the Backwoods Bastard really shines. Up front the tongue is bittersweet burnt caramel, bourbon, and sweet malt with a back palate formed of lingering honey and vanilla notes with a faint hardwood bitterness keeping it from getting cloying. A delicious and beautifully balanced brew!    Feel: Medium body with lingering syrup on the tongue. Minimal carbonation.    According to the bottles it was put out in 2015, so with at least two years aging it comes out pretty damn tasty.

Alcohol is definitely noticeable. Very malty and lots of bourbon character.    F: Oily and thick, this is a big beer.    O: This is a very malty and beast of a barrel aged beer, highly recommended.

The beer pours a brown color with snow globe particles throughout. Two inches of tan head settle into a barely there ring around the glass. The aroma is oak and vanilla with only a suggestion of bourbon. The taste is a rich, slightly smokey malt with a notable bourbon barrel flavor coming in behind. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, moderately carbonated and somewhat soft leaving a barrel heat on the tongue once swallowed. Overall, very good. I am not a bourbon fan and it is not a fan of me. This is the third beer I've tasted from this four pack and I do enjoy these more with age. It's a trade off losing heat and bourbon prominence but getting floaties that are a little distracting. This bottle was stored in my basement around 60 degrees.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a thistle, the appearance was a mostly dark brown close to black color with a finger's worth of white foamy head that softened to leave some thin speckled sliding lace.  The aroma had a superb blend of sweet caramel/toffee malts, dark bread, nice level amount of peat, light amount of smoke, sweet wood, vanilla, some earthiness and just a hint of allspice.  The flavor brought all of the previously mentioned aromas together in an awesome manner, even the allspice but even that seems mostly to be just an afterthought in this beer. Some dark fruits slide in underneath. The aftertaste yields to the sweetness of the wood, dark fruits, dark bread, caramel/toffee malts and the peat.  The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a clear sipping quality about it. A fresh bottle of this, I have found tends to be a bit stronger in the boozy heat quality while an aged bottle of this, the booziness tends to subside to create an exceptionally smooth well rounded quality rolling over my tongue. At no time during the life of this beer, I have never found anything cloying about this.  Overall, call this a combined "fresh" to "aged" review of this beer, if you will, but no matter whenever I have this beer, it always is an absolutely fantastic experience.

Pours hazy very dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, and date; with lighter notes of chocolate, leather, tobacco, smoke, herbal, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready/light roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and fruity yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, and date; with lighter notes of chocolate, leather, tobacco, smoke, herbal, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light herbal bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, brown bread, leather, tobacco, light smoke, herbal, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and fruity yeast flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from bitter/spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/silky, and lightly sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 11.2%, with no barrel booziness. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged scotch ale. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.

It pours a tawny deep brown color topping up with a finger of foamy light tan head that stands for a while before collapsing to some everlasting bubble sheet on the surface and leaving some spotty and patchy lacing on the glass-side.    It is very malty and sweet in the aroma with notes of caramel, toffee, brown sugar, burnt coconut-like, some smoked, roasted, toasted biscuit, brown bread, and wood. The bourbon barrel profile lends its oaky, spicy, vanilla, and some fruit while hop provides its scents of earthy and spice. There are also notes of dark fruit and licorice to add up the depth.    Malt and malt and malt and bourbon through the palate sensation, it is led by rich malt bill of caramel, toffee, brown sugar, burnt coconut-like, some smoked, roasted, toasted biscuit, brown bread, and wood just like the aroma while the bourbon barrel-aged provides its oaky, spicy, vanilla, and some fruity flavors together with earthiness and spice from hop as well as some dark fruit and licorice. There is some bitterness at the almost end from both roasted malt and hop while the aftertaste is lasting with pleasant bitterness and some residual malt sweetness and roasted.    The body is rather full but not sticky or syrupy with smooth mouthfeel and moderate crisp carbonation. The overall feeling is very well-rounded with a pleasantly dry finish.    This one is a supreme malty beast that is amped up with oaky and bourbon barrel profile making it deep and rich also very tasty and very good for sipping.

Pours a dark cola color and consistency with one finger of tan head that fades to a bubbly crown but rises with a swirl of the snifter. The nose is strong enough but I had a hard time picking out individual aromas other than sweet caramel and some bourbon. My first couple of sips were straight up coconut which is perplexing to me. This character fades but never leaves as other flavors open up. Dark fruit, caramel and bourbon are most notable. I don't find it very boozy though it does finish with some heat. Medium to full in body and I would say both creamy and a little frothy.     A great tasting sipper. I wish I had tried this one years ago!

Light hoppy bitterness of the finish. Medium full body, low-moderate carbonation. Dry, slightly bitter finish. A fantastic example of a BA scotch ale.

Many times for me these hyped beers end up being a anticlimactic experience - where others describe an almost divine experience, my palate ends up being sadly unimpressed. Well, not the case here. Though it wasn't entirely impressive going into the glass, once it settled, it was something to behold. The brew has a dark caramel color, very dark, with tan head that keeps around and light amount of lacing. The smell was almost perfect, almost, as you are assailed with roasted malts, the strong boozy scent of bourbon, and chocolate, definitely some chocolate notes in there. The mouthfeel is carbonated, but not heavily, it is certainly full-bodied, and has a strong astringent quality on the tongue. Quite possibly this is the my least favorite aspect of the brew. The taste is truly special - bourbon, chocolate notes, the roasted malts - everything that I smelled I tasted as well, a big plus in my book.     So what I experienced was certainly up to the hype - this is certainly a bastard of a beer.

Nose is earthy raisin and wood with hints of dark chocolate and toffee.    The taste follows. Scotch Ales aren't typically my thing, nor are beers that overdo the barrel character. This is pretty restrained though, particularly for an 11% ABV beer. Scotch, wood, and dark fruit. Suggestions of anise, caramel, and dark chocolate.     Mouthfeel is medium. An initial zip of carbonation tapers into a smooth finish.     Overall, do you like Scotch Ales? This is definitely a good one. Just not my go-to flavor profile or style. Becomes a touch astringent as it approaches room temperature.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 The 2016 iteration of this barrel-aged Scotch Ale is a great-looking beer: a large, pebbly peach/tan head sits atop an effervescent, deep-brown beer, leaving excellent lacing in the form of dense sheets and thick bands. The nose is big and heady: bourbon and more modest coconutty oak lactones over a fairly rich, light-complected caramel character that shows a bit of butterscotch at the top; significant alcohol overtones ride atop everything else. Up front, the palate is darkish, slightly bitter caramel with hints of bourbon; mid-palate the malt character becomes darker yet as a semi-sweet chocolate character joins the caramel. The bourbon and coconut notes are much more subtle than on the nose, acting more as accents than as the center of attention. Significant alcohol overtones keep the malt well in check, preventing the beer from coming across as the least bit sweet. The finish is a good hit of caramel and booze, and is quite warming; the linger is a lasting modest oaky bitterness that has a slight solvent-like tang. Retrogustative olfaction is redolent of bourbon, and is quite boozy. Mouthfeel is commensurate with the medium body, and is slightly warming; the texture is medium-creamy, slightly slick, and slightly peppery from the somewhat restrained carbonation.

Smells of toffee, caramel, roasted grains, light bourbon, woody notes, oak barrels, dark fruit, cocoa, hints of vanilla and coconut, and a wave of sweet malty aromas. The malty dominance brings out brown sugar, wheat bread, syrup and spent mash, then finishing off with some more bourbon. The bourbon is soft and mixes well, it reminds me of a well aged KBS or Bourbon County Stout.    Tastes sweet and malty up front with toasted grains that seem rum soaked, followed by vanilla, toasted oak, bourbon, brown sugar, toffee, dark fruit, raisins, maple syrup, tea leaf, mild piney hops, sticks and/or earthy notes, wood and cocoa powder. The flavor lacks any smoked grains and appear supplemented by the bourbon barrel accents. Really, really complex and tasty even though it deviates from a traditional Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy.    Mouthfeel is very smooth yet thick with texture while seeming thin as it slides down easy, even with the light burn from the booze, the evident ABV and mild carbonation. It's dominated by malty bread components with recurring caramel, oak, bourbon and sweet fruity flavors. Overall a fine beer that was dynamic and quite enjoyable.

The aroma is somewhat unbalanced with very strong bourbon and vanilla at the very fore, with only a hint of malt and peat in the background.     The flavor follows its nose in both good and bad ways. There is a good balance of malts and hops (a touch at the end) but the bourbon, vanilla, and ethanol is pretty prevalent.     The flavor is big, the body is not. Like many barrel aged offerings I've tried lately, this one is a little thin. However, the carbonation is excellent and helps keep what is otherwise a sweet beer from getting cloying.    Overall this is fine, but if I want a good off-beat wee-heavy I will stick with Founders's other "Bastard." The bourbon is just a bit too strong on this one. I'm wondering if this one is just too young. I'm going to tuck a couple of bottles away and try them to see if the bourbon notes will mellow.

And I don't own any proper Founders glass anyway. Best by 04/06/17...    Backwoods bastard is pretty heavy, as puts the label 'Extra Strong Beer' (11,1%)..Oh, 'bière extra forte' it's even in french. We appreciate it, but I guess this translation is more aimed at the québécois, because we normally don't get this in France.    This has a brownish color, taste bourbon, brown sugar, milk.. this is definitely a very complex brew and I don't have the knowledge or palate to detect every aroma. I've been milking this for an hour now, still do as I write this. You don't chug a beer like that uh?    Overall, an excellent wee heavy which is a style I don't remember ever trying, and I have proudly added another major American brewery to my 'bucket list'. Still looking forward to try new ones... Cheers!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 I poured a 2014 into a tulip glass while watching a movie. It was over 2 years old and had aged beautifully. Dark amberish with a decent head. It smelled like raisins and figs with a sweetness that said "try me". It was very smooth with the perfect amount of heat and enough of the bourbon to give that taste that I love without overpowering the great scotch ale that it is. I loved it.

Taste caramel and vanilla. Also strong Bourbon and hints of smoke and dark fruit. Finish is semi-sweet with vanilla, malty linger with a touch of bitter. High side of full-bodied. Creamy medium carbonation.

Pours a slightly hazy, dark brown-amber with a thin light khaki head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of deep caramel malt, dates and figs, hint of plums, bourbon. Flavor follows with caramel malt, toffee, dates, figs, dried plums, bourbon and a touch of oak and peat. Medium bodied with good creaminess, nice mouth feel. It's clear why this has a good reputation. All the classic flavors of a scotch ale with a good bourbon overtone. Well balanced with integrated flavors. Many good scotch ales have a little astringency in the finish; that is absent here, very smooth from start to finish. I see why Founders has such a following. Glad to see them in the West Coast. I will get this one again.

Appearance: A clear deep amber brown colour with a one finger tanned head that had decent retention and left nice spotty lacing.    Aroma: Caramel, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon and booze with perhaps a hint of sweet dark fruit.    Taste: It’s what you expect from the aroma with sweet melted caramel, toffee, vanilla, raisins, oak and bourbon with a light nuttiness on the finish.    Mouthfeel: Creamy, full bodied with low carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden yet there is a nice lasting alcohol warmth.    Overall: Just great!

First, the nose, huge notes of bourbon,  Butterscotch, caramel, and malt  Earthy, beautiful tones of spice   This beer is without a fault.     And the flavor- oh, the flavor!  So much barrel and balanced still   Sweet fruit, anise, and some heat  I wish my cup was always fill.    I've had a lot of barrel aged beers,  Hundreds of them, at least  This one here is the perfect combo  Of malt and hops and yeast.

Lucky my buddy wanted to share this one. Sweet caramel, little bit of toffee, with a perfect bourbon finish that definitely smoothed out as the years have passed  Feel: perfect for a beer of this alcohol content. Smooth and velvety.   Overall: One of my favorite beers, and age only made it better, in my opinion. If you can find an aged version on tap or in bottles, go and get it, you will not regret it.

I hadn't been drinking as much beer in the past several years, but this was a game changer. It sent me on a path to seek out more and more different craft beers and really get back into it. The only thing slightly negative about it for me is that it can be a little too intense. I can only handle one bottle in a sitting, and it needs to be a looong sitting to avoid feeling wasted.    It looks amazing poured out, but I enjoy it straight from the bottle too, because I don't get that powerful eye watering effect of breathing into the glass on accident or the non-beer-drinkin' hubby's comments on the smell filling up the room. Another benefit of drinking from the bottle is looking at the label. You look straight into his eyes every time you need a reminder that you do not eff with the Backwoods Bastard and you do not eff around with this beer.

M: I thought the 2014 version was smoother and creamier, but I have no complaints about 2016.    O: One of my favorite beers.

Aroma is of scotch, barrel notes, malt, caramel.    Taste is amazing follows the aroma with a boozyness upfront of scotch then fades into slight smoke, vanilla barrel notes mid swallow. Finishes with a nice scotch boozy heat.    Mouth feel is thick viscous, creamy, full. You know your drinking something substantial.   One of the best.

Sticky legs, but next to no lacing.    Bourbon in the nose - potent with hints of stone fruit and sweet malt, but the base beer is largely overwhelmed by the bourbon aromatics (tobacco, vanilla, leather, candy-corn, etc.).    Flavor follows the nose with greater intensity of both the bourbon (including a flourish of alcohol) and the malt (chewy and rich without being cloying or grainy). Low bitterness, and no obvious hop contribution flavor-wise. Faintly smokey medium-dry finish with successive waves of melanoidins and stone fruit with a hint of sherry-aged single malt. More spirit than barrel throughout.    Rich yet somehow thin mouth-feel; carbonation could be a bit higher maybe.    Very excited to have this available locally, though the price is becoming prohibitive ($4.50/12oz), and while the bourbon contributes very good flavor, it doesn't necessarily elevate the style.

Pours a deep, dark, just short of opaque mahogany with a finger-thick off-white, beige head that dissipated at somewhat slowly and left a little bit of lacing. Carbonation is evident on the sides of the glass when swirled and held up to the light. Smell is big bold caramel, bourbon, molasses, and a touch of spice. Taste follows suit, but of course, more pronounced. Marshmallowy combo of malts and Bourbon is killer and, like the Dirty Bastard, the touch of caramelly sweetness and the loving hop bite, work like a dream together. The feel is full bodied and relatively thick with a carbonation that is lively, but not overly so. Overall, I absolutely love this beer and can't wait to see what age will do for it. Can't recommend this highly enough. Layers of complexity, flavors from across the spectrum, and not too ridiculous a price, either. For me, I'd call it perfect.

Nice two fingers of khaki head that settles to a half-finger. Sheets of lacing and good retention. (4.25)	    S:	  Rich dark fruits, slight tannins, oaky barrel character, roasted nuts. (4.25)	    T:	  Rich and hearty with little detectable alcohol. Cocoa powder, molasses, dried cherries, slight bourbon oaky warmth, layers of toffee coated, nutty malt. (4.25)	    M:	  Smooth, rich, drinkable, warming-but-not-boozy, medium-plus body, soft carbonation. (4.25)	    O:	  Excellent Scotch ale, excellent barrel character.   This is a tasty, drinkable beer with rich layers of toffee and fruit cake. The barrel is there and is a perfect level for my preferences: present but not omni-present and the wood comes through a little stronger than the booze that was previously in it. Alcohol is well-hidden, all-around enjoyable beer. Seriously, 11 ABV?!?! Crazy!   I would definitely have this one again. (4.5)   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 The wait is over as I finally cracked open a bottle of Backwoods Bastard for the 1st time and have to say with how much anticipation I had for this beer I am highly disappointed. Perhaps my glassware wasn't very appropriate as I poured it into a goblet but still it's not as delicious as Founders Dirty Bastard which I expected this to be similar just stronger.  Alright so poured into a goblet and color is of a caramel chocolate brown, almost resembles that of maple syrup with a very thin lining head right from the get go. It's a 12oz bottle yet 3 months since it was bottled the carbonation has already shrunk as now it look like 11oz or less which is surprising as I had always read that this type of beer is good for aging but if that is so why has an ounce already been reduced? Nevertheless I still have 3 that I plan on aging which perhaps next year I will think differently about this beer.    The aroma is quite mild with smells of oak and scotch but not as powerful as expected or even as powerful as the dirty bastard.    The feel of this beer is light and smooth with a mild sizzle.    Taste is that of scotch and not beer and when it comes to what I'd rather choose it would be scotch. It's a scotch with some barley and mild carbonation. Tastes also include oak, caramel, vanilla, malt, and butterscotch. Not a bad November-March beer but not as good as I had come to expect.

The color is similar to a raisin dark violet black. The head is creamy beige. Taste something like raisins and sweet. It tastes naturally sweet as if it was pressed fruit. The alcohol is noticeable at first but later not so much as my tongue got use to the new flavor. It lingers on on the tongue after swallowing. I prefer to let it sit on my tongue for 3 seconds before swallowing. It ends crisp and clean. This is a beer that is most certainly a sit back and relax after dinner. I would only need one for the remainder of the night. Not an everyday beer or one that I would drink in a day. It must be a one a day and only after a good meal. Classy.

Price: $14.99 for a 4-pack  Purchased: Oct. 25, 2016   Consumed: Oct. 30, 2016  Reviewed as: Scotch / Wee Heavy  Misc.: 2016 release; Bottled Sept. 22, 2016 at 5:56 p.m. ET    Had been wanting to try this one for a long time. Finally saw it in stores for the first time at Bine & Vine. Wanted to get just a 12-oz. bottle, but they only had them in 4-packs. Ended up pulling the trigger for $14.99, picking up the last one. The label says it all - Scotch-Style Aged in Oak Bourbon Barrels.    Poured a dark brown-to-light-black color with two fingers of khaki-tan frothy head. A few bubble streams coming up at various points on the glass. World-class spiderweb foamy lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.50)    Smelled a mix of boozy bourbon and deep oaky notes. Wow, very appealing. Digging deeper got vanilla, caramel, toffee, leathery tobacco, raisins, dates, oak chips, cocoa, sticky dark fruits and Whoppers candy. Cooled down on the nose as it went down. Really had me wanting to try it. (Smell - 4.50)     Tasted very similar to the nose, but maybe not quite as good. Getting woody oak chips, smooth bourbon, subdued vanilla, raisins, dates, some earthy tobacco, cocoa, bitter dark chocolate, roasty malts, more dark fruits (plum?), caramel malts, touch of brown sugar, still getting Whoppers candy, maybe the malted chocolate, and toasted toffee. Wow, feeling that 11.2 pct. warming down my stomach. This is wonderful. (Taste - 4.25)    Full body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, warming finish. (Feel - 4.50)    This was just awesome. Even better than I thought it was going to be. (Overall - 4.50)    4.40 | 98 | A

I am reviewing an aged bottle**    Bottled 10/7/14; drank 11/16/15 @ the Yarchives.     Poured from the bottle into a glass.    Opaque orange/brown appearance.     A rough pour yielded a small khaki head which quickly dissipated; strong lace.     Caramel, cream soda & faint oak notes in the nose.     Thick, creamy mouthfeel.     Oak, cream soda & molasses flavors up front; dark caramel notes on the finish. Almost no booze heat. A year made a big, positive difference on this beer; it has aged into a rich dessert treat.

The flavor features vanilla, rice puddings, fig, chocolate, cinnamon, raising, and a hint if bubblegum, The mouthfeel is full, soft, rich, and sticky. Overall this is a simply amazing beer. The flavors a full but in excellent balances, and there is a rich, almost vinous quality here that is utterly charming.

Smell is vanilla, oak, light raisin/aged fruit, caramel, then some boozy heat but not exactly 'bourbon' like.     Taste is on the same plane as the aroma with vanilla heavy, oak undertones, caramel and figs/raisins; further warming brings forth some coconut, toffee and nuts. Booziness is strong, but not in anyway detracting - pleasant warming like a good bourbon based drink.     Mouthfeel has moderate carbonation, some sharper bite at the end.     Overall a pleasantly drinkable beer with deep flavors and some strong booziness with surprisingly strong vanilla/coconut like flavors.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 This is almost a perfect beer for me. I was already a fan of Dirty Bastard but the aging in bourbon barrels just puts it over the top. I will be aging this over time to see how this goes as well as purchasing subsequent years offerings. The ratings I give should speak for themselves (btw poured from a 12 oz 10/05/16 bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip glass) but the feel in the mouth was just superb in how filling it was.    2/12/2018 update. Poured into a Lost Abbey tulip. Age has not removed the barrel taste or the carbonation, still has a nice head, but maybe it's slightly more balanced and the mouthfeel is still outstanding. If nothing else, this makes me even more happy that it will soon be available year round.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.75 Look:   Pours a muddy brown color with a half finger, beige head.    Aroma:   Rich with lots of sticky toffee, caramel, molasses and mild fudge. Somewhat fruity and candy like with hints of sweet red licorice and candied apples. Has a faint woody character. Alcohol is detectable on the nose.    Taste:  Very sweet. Upfront you get a smooth and rich albeit slightly alcoholic toffee, butterscotch and molasses flavor.There are spicy notes of cinnamon, cola, smoked oak wood and vanilla beans in the background. Vague notions of licorice and candied apples hiding somewhere. It ends on more boozy notes of really sweet caramel, red fruits, and chocolate.    Feel:  Very sticky and sugary sweet on the tongue. Borderline slimy. As previously mentioned it's slightly hot and alcoholic. Heavy body with low carbonation.    Overall:  The flavor is good, but it's too sweet for me. A one and done beer in my opinion. Something I really have to be in the right type of mood for in order to enjoy properly.

Bottled 22 September 2016.  3.75/4/4.75/4.5/4.5  A: Pours surprisingly clear nut brown, but turns deep mahogany red in the glass. No head.  S: Smells sweet and syrupy. Maple syrup, not cough syrup. Hella malt like a good scotch ale should.  T/M: Taste is astoundingly rich and deep. Huge caramel sugars roll and roll, forcing the tongue to slog through the sheer volume of flavor. The flavors come in a narrow band, akin to one another -- maple, whiskey, caramel, butterscotch, brown sugar, dense bread. Even if the notes are close together, their intensity makes up for a lack of variety. Thick without ever quite being sticky. Mild carbonation. A sipper and a chewer.  O: A heavy-hitting beer that knows exactly what it wants to do and smashes into that goal with considerable force. If you don't like dark, autumnal flavors (maple, bourbon, rich Demerara) look elsewhere than this malt bomb.    Notes  Bottle tasting notes (mostly including for use of 'scintilla'):   "Expect lovely, warm smells of single malt sctoch, oaky bourbon barrels, smoke, sweet caramel and roasted malts. A bot of earthy spice and a scintilla of dark fruit. It's a kick-back sipper made to excite the palate."

Also have had this on tap at the Nashua Garden, a 12oz pour for $4.00 during Happy Hour!!    Poured a 12oz bottle into a small tulip. It is a very dense, opaque bier, but there are some lovely ruby/garnet highlights showing when held up to the light. Has very little head to speak of save for some fine, light tan bubbles gathering at the edge of the glass. Lacing is on the light side as well. The aroma is superb, with the bourbon blending with some caramel and peat for a great olfactory experience. The body is medium-plus and a touch chewy, and the liquid is satiny smooth going down.     Flavor has some caramel sweetness and brown sugar hitting the palate first. The bourbon is easily detected, mixing in with a bit of vanilla, some peaty malts and a hint of oak. Doesn't have much of your typical hoppy action, but it does finish with some earthy notes. The alcohol is, scarily, well-hidden in this tasty Bastard.

Once I brought the glass to my nose definite caramel notes were noticeable with just a subtle hint of raisin.     T- There is a light but very perceptible flavor of bourbon with very light charred oak that is enhanced and plays well with the sweetness of roasted malt. There is a slight and pleasant back end bitterness that is almost chocolaty.     F- Very light on the tongue and surprisingly smooth and clean for an 11.6% beer.     Overall I would agree with a previous reviewer that this is to date my favorite Scotch Ale and highly recommend it.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 From bottle at home in a stunted Pilsner Ommegang glass. 2016 Release.    Me Oh My...Thanks to Ben, at Whole Foods, without whom I would have passed this by.     Label says "ale aged in oak bourbon barrels". I'm big on the bourbon barrel aged stuff, but look more to porters & stouts & have overlooked this fine brew for some time.    It ain't cheap but I've come to accept my trashy attraction to the big boys & their big prices. Herein is a competitively priced big flavored brew, that, category aside stands tall. My prejudice would have passed it over for being a mere ale. That it is not.    The color is a deep mahogany with a stingy head & negligible lacing. The aroma is more full then big. There's the oak,of coarse, but also rich vanilla & lots of raisin & caramel. The big surprise is the mouthful. It exceeds what I would expect from an ale. It pushes the boundaries.    My take was a great surprise of a full bodied, big flavored, adult strength treat that deserve a place on anyone's list.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 One of the few beers I've had in my life that receives constant hype and then actually lives up to said hype. Excellent Scotch ale that exceeds the great Oskar Blues "Old Chub", and does in fact improve upon the already great Dirty Bastard. It keeps the chewy salted caramel texture of Dirty Bastard, then jacks up the alcohol content and polishes it with bourbon barrel maturity. The one issue I have with Scotch Ale (one of the most reliably tasty styles) is that it can be a bit too sweet, but the bronze of a toasted oak barrel is the perfect solution. Bourbon barrel aging has become a cliche in the craft beer world, but it benefits this style of beer even more than the strong American stouts to which it's usually applied. It's got texture and smoothness for days, suaveness in a glass.

A - Pours a garnet red with half a finger's width of tight white bubbles that quickly recede into a thin ring. Alcohol legs observed with spotty lacing.  S - The nose is yet to open up as the beer is still cold. Can detect mild barrel notes (wood), torched sugar, raisins. Smells sweet.  T - For a beer at 11.2% with barrel influence, this drinks amazingly smooth. Warmth felt in the chest after the liquid has gone down the windpipe. Save for that, there is no hint that this beer is north of 10% ABV. Starts out slightly sweet, and immediately the barrel influence is felt, with notes of almond and vanilla tempering the sweetness. The hops are just enough to create an amazingly well-balanced beer. The backend is all barrel, this one.  F - The mouthfeel is slightly thinner than what I would expect for a beer this rich, but that is not a negative. Just goes to show that Founders has crafted an incredibly drinkable beer, that will appeal equally to the uninitiated as well as the connoisseurs. It would not be hard to put down a few of these in a hurry!  O - I've heard great things about this beer with a few months on it, but in my opinion, this is good to go fresh. I still have a few more bottles that I will likely sample at 3 months' interval - but that is just for intellectual curiosity. If you have just one bottle, it wouldn't be a mistake to drink up now.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured into a snifter/tulip/wine hybrid glass from a 12 oz bottle    A - Swampy blood red and soil brown with a less than one finger creamy tan head and some sugar legs and lacing    S - This ale even smells creamy. Bourbon and oak are on point, wow. Vanilla, sugar, caramel, some sarsaparilla, booze, tons of malt both dry, sweet and a tad roasted, green and brown earth, peat, over ripe fruits, baking spices, very yeasty, a little floral and the hops are super earthy.     T - Creamy malts, bourbon and scotch barrels, slight smoke (maybe peat), slight earthy hops, cracker yeast, tons of vanilla, a bit of baking spices minus the cinnamon, sugar up the wazoo, fruit leather (berries and figs), caramel, molasses and just plain awesome.     M - Full bodied, great balance, great complexity, medium balance, medium acidity and a awesome barrel aged ride from beginning to end.     D/O - This one is awesome fresh and also made for the cellar. Perfect for all times of the year,but it does fit the fall winter weather perfectly. Something to considering sipping on for Thanksgiving, Christmas and for sure on New Year's eve and day. If you want to impress those at your dinner party or just a social gathering. Founders does it again.     Final thoughts - A high price at $15 per four-pack but the taste and 11.2% ABV will make up for all that. The "Old Ale" on tap would be super amazing.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Pours opaque, dark brown with ruby highlights. A small, tightly packed rim of cappuccino head.    Oozing big hits of browned butter and caramel. Add some boozy fruit and I'm dreaming of Christmas pudding and cake batter. Palette follows, just smacking of sweet, smoky bourbon.     A slow sipper for sure. Overpowering for some, but a great aging candidate.

Flavorful, full, and engaging. Excellent.

Doesn't taste anything like a scotch ale, it is hoppy, which scotch ales aren't and you can barely taste the oak aging..  I should have known this beer wasn't going to be that grate considering it was made by an American brewing company, I think if your going to label something a scotch ale it should be made like a scotch ale. The IBU's on this beer are 55 and they shouldn't be even half that, also I can taste the fact that there American grown hops and not English hops like a scotch ale is supposed to be.... All in all though its not that bad, it's just not as good as the rateings are saying it is

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 9/26/16, 1 month old, Served at 45 degrees in a snifter.     Backwoods pours a mahogany and prune juice colored body, much like its brother, the Dirty Bastard. The head is tall and egg foam yellow, spilling over and staying at 2 fingers in my snifter. The body when held up to the light looks a lot like a cranberry-cherry cocktail. Just deep, dark reds with a little light at the bottom.     Wouldn't you know, it smells just like Dirty Bastard. Raisin, prune, plum, maybe some fig and cherry notes. Very faint bourbon barrel.     The flavor of this beer is pretty singular...but still a bit complex. Its got the signature DB flavor, but what surrounds it is enhanced notes of dark cherry, fig, and a shot of whiskey. Some hottness, dryness, and peated malt finish out the profile. The more it warms it develops licorice flavors as well.     Feel is sticky, hot, dry, and smooth...in that order.     Overall, a bit disappointed here. I was expecting more from this BBA version but alas, it's simply DB with some enhanced notes. Not even close to KBS like some are raving about - KBS is in a different zip code entirely. I'm glad I got a chance to try one rather than investing in a 4 pack. For the price, it's a loser.

Taste is an outstanding deep malty/toffee undertone with a strong bourbon aftertaste. Overall, this is another great, buy-as-much-as-you-can-while-its-around Founder's classic! I will be cellaring a few alongside my KBS for a year and 3 years to see how age makes this incredible beer taste!!

Sweet malts and maybe a tad bit of toffe. Some bread as well. Smells like a Trappist.     Taste of sweet malts, oak and a tad of bourbon and toffe. Very bready and Very smooth for its alcohol content.     Mouth was very nice. Medium bodied with a nice oaky smooth finish.     I would definetly drink this guy again. I think I would prefer a breakfast stout instead, but a solid beer nonetheless   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a hazy deep brown with smallish cream colored head. Head dissipates a bit quicker than expected leaving spots of lace and a ring around the glass. Nose is dates, burnt sugars, vanilla, barrel cellar mustiness, and a bit of sour apple. Flavor follows, and although initially sweet, turns much drier that expected and quite woody with mostly oak into the finish where it wasn't very present early. Hot/boozy even after cellaring for 1 year. Mouthfeel is not cloying at all, but just medium with the booze thinking it out. Overall, a good beer, but I can't go as high as most here as I just don't think it comes together cohesively in the end.

Rich maltiness in the aroma, big hints of oak and bourbon with doses of brown sugar and caramel. Following the nose well, big brown sugar, sweet malt and caramel hit the palate initially with nice sweet bourbon kick in the back end. Medium mouthfeel, somewhat boozy after taste with low carbonation.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Absolutely delectable beer. One of my very favorites, Wee Heavy or otherwise.    Pours a deep, dark brown with touches of cherry-wood on the edges, with a soft two-finger tan head that initially holds up well, then settles to a tidy residual foam on the surface of the liquid and provides faint streaks of sticky lacing down the glass.    The aromas truly shine, with an abundance of bourbon -- toffee, charred oak, smoked peat, tobacco, and molasses -- leading the way, followed by decadent doses of dark chocolate, medium roast coffee beans, vanilla, fig newtons, raisins, roasted nuts, and dried fruits. There's some hop presence, as well, with small touches of grassiness and pine resin. But the dark malts and bourbon barrel characteristics are what this baby is all about, and they are incredible.    The tongue follows the nose, and very nearly keeps up with that remarkably high standard. I get an initial note of bitter dark roast coffee, but that is quickly overtaken by waves of semi-sweet chocolate, caramel, vanilla, pecans, oak, brown sugar, and dark berry jam. It's decadent, but not overly sweet, with a wonderful balance and potpourri of flavors. The malts are deep and rich, and the bourbon influences are spot on. Absolutely delicious.    Feel is a touch thin given the hearty flavor profile and dark depths, but still creamy and coating. Carbonation level is perfect (i.e., minimal), and the booze provides only a traces of heat. This one is incredibly easy to drink.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Ordered it from Beer52, and poured to a regular kitchen glass due to lack of proper beer glass.    A: The body is black with amber hues with a very nice beige head that showed lots of consistency, lacing and will to be on top of the beer for all time.  S: The aroma was just perfect, this is totally my kind of beer. You could smell tons of bourbon on this, presenting itself like the basic pillars of the aroma only allowing you to smell the malt a bit later. Gosh, amazing.  T: When you first sip the beer, it's very sweet with a very big profile of awesome bourbon that goes along very well with the malts. Technically, it seems that the "bourbon-ness" of the beer is the same characteristic the malty one, but only read differently on different mouth/tongue zones.   M: The body is medium to high. No bitterness in the end but no one asked for it. To finish it great style, the alcohol goes unnoticed, which makes this a very noble beer. Mouth-wise, perfect, 5.0.  O: I've had very few Founders beers in the past, this is for sure my favorite.

The barrel does not predominate the smell like other barrel aged beers. Definitely prevalent boozy oaky barrel but balanced out by the sweetness of the actual beer. Notes of toffee and caramel with a touch of butterscotch. Taste follows the smell but the butterscotch becomes more pronounced. The sweet taste of the beer predominates with a lingering hop/burnt bitterness hint on the back end. It is surprisingly viscous but still medium heavy body. Definitely coats your lips and leaves them a little sticky but nothing out of this world. Overall I would say this is an excellent Scotch ale the only improved with the barrel aging. The barrel definitely added a nice complexity to what is most likely an already great beer. Definitely worth seeking out.

Bourbon barrels make a nice sweet bourbony note on the aroma of the Scottish malt, while the flavor is a really nice balance and finish of scotch ale and bourbon barrel. Develops on the taste buds like a fine scotch. Freakin excellent. There is a slight bitterness and that is why this is not a 5 (some may not even notice!). Still, worth seeking, worth buying enough bottles for aging, and a steal for it's 11.6% of smiles it pours on the mind.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Dark red/brown. Thin head. Some lacing. Carbonation dies away slowly.

Smoother and easier to drink as it warms.  Definitely a sipper but the alcohol is a bit too much for my liking.

Thanks @WesMantooth for sending this along in your Founders-full second NBS BIF#3 box!    Deep chestnut brown pour with a light creamy ring around the lid and a dragon spiral of effervescence across the central gathering point. Artistically appealing?    Nose provides some traditional layers of caramel and boozy raisin and leather and tobacco. Some dried dark fruits in there as well. As it warms these become more prominent. Bourbon is primarily relegated to finishing touch duties with some round oakiness and a smootheness in the finish.    Flavour provides an interesting study between the butterscotch/toffee and oak and then on the other side we have some distinguished guests from the lands of leather and dried prune and the like. Comes together beautifully though. Barrel serves to tie it all together beautifully. Smoothe and drinkable, though the alcohol isn't quite as masterfully hidden as some other contemporaries. Highly recommend, and excited to see what my other, older bottles are doing these days...    Thanks Corey!

Seems like alot of the complexities open up with a 20 minute warmup phase, but this is still too hot.    F: A little sticky but I want more body. This need a soft character to invite all these flavors. And it's just not present.    O: I guess some people just masturbate furiously to any Founder's release. This is indeed a bastardized brew.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a barrel aged snifter - blind tasting.     Pours a crisp reddish hue with a thin tan head. Head slowly dissipates leaving a thin tan lacing along the top. Great color for the style.     Smell was of raisins, blackcurrant, and oak, maple. An overarching boozy smell was noted, hallmark of barrel aging. Also got some minor notes of peat and scotch - very pleasant for the style.     Taste is immediately remarkable because it is so smooth and mellow. Notes of vanilla, wood, raisins, prunes come through giving way to undertones of bourbon soaked oak, bready malts, biscuits finally finishing with a pleasant mild bitter taste.     Feel was thin and light, but not watery - tons of flavors here keep it hefty but its still very drinkable. Medium carbonation keeps it crisp.     Overall this was tasted as part of a blind tasting of five barrel aged wee heavies. Wonderful example of the style - and given the availability and price point for this one, its unbeatable.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottle courtesy of the largesse of @Ri0. Acording to the rear label, this was bottled on September 26th, 2015    Poured into an Iron Goat snifter, this was a very dark brown color, but took on a rubyish tint when held up to light. There was initially a large, creamy, beige-tan colored head, but it dropped fairly quickly, leaving spotty lace.     Big, boozy, oaky and sweet aroma to this. There’s elements of toffee, caramel, licorice, vanilla, smoke, wood and bourbon.    Wow! This is a complex-tasting beer, with all the elements noted above, for the most part tremendously well balanced against one another. There’s a fair amount of bourbon heat up front, but not enough to drown out the other elements.     Fairly full bodied, with a creamy mouthfeel.    I'm really glad this comes in a 12oz bottle. A bomber would have been too much of a good thing. Although it’s got some “heat” to it, this is a quite drinkable beer for something at the bigger end of the style. Still, I can’t help but feel that a couple years laydown this might be truly amazing. Something to fantasize about in a dream future where Founders is distributed to Washington. Huge shout out to Ri0 for getting me one of these!

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 5 2015 vintage poured at cellar temp into a snifter.    L: Deep red with a tan head, some residual lacing. Lots of sediment in this bottle, don't remember seeing that before. Interesting how brown the foam is compared to how red the beer itself. I love how brown the lacing stays.  S: Bourbon, caramel, toffee. Like a savory bourbon candy. I could sit and smell this all night.  T: Smoky malts, caramel, bourbon and butter. Butterscotch, I guess! 11.6% ABV is very smooth. Heavy bourbon but not a strong alcohol flavor. So smooth and rich. Intoxicating.  F: Carbonation is surprisingly active but provides a creamy mouthfeel. Definitely thicker than your average beer. Not oily or filmy.  O: I go back and forth between this and the Central Waters version. Both are about as good as beer gets, in my book. Don't chill it or you'll miss the warm, smooth bourbon glow. I had it on tap once and it was fully chilled. Caused some odd sharp flavors to come out and couldn't smell the sweet notes. Drink slowly at cellar temp and let the taste and aroma open up as it warms. Dirty Bastard is pretty good, not my favorite; Backwoods is on another level.

Aroma: whiskey   Taste: whiskey is strong, caramel, toast, plum , grape. Not smooth. a bit strong.   Feel: medium carbonation, acidic.   Not my cup of tea. I think barrel aging works better with thicker/darker beers.  **  11/01/2016  Bottle (9/26/16) to snifter.    Coming around on this. Definately enjoying this much more than 2 years ago. I did not note the date back then, but this is very fresh.    Aroma, look, taste, feel notes are all still accurate, I am just enjoying this more. OA 2.84 way up to 4.01.    **  04/27/2017  Founders tasting with DC.    **

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 APPEARANCE: More or less an opaque, mahogany-brown. A half finger of khaki head that settles quickly to a ring. Good carbonation when rocking the glass from side to side. Some spotty lacing and legs down the glass.  AROMA: Big brown sugar, mild bourbon/alcohol, lots of dark dried fruits/raisin, figs. A tiny bit of smoke.   TASTE: Very smooth and sweet up front, molasses, dark dried fruits, bourbon comes out on the finish.  FEEL: Medium carbonation, very dry all the way through the sip, full body and pretty chewy.  OVERALL: Nice sipper. The bourbon quality continues to build as you drink but it's not a boozy mess, very flavorful. Sip and relax with this one.

Pours a dark burgundy with thin tan head that quickly dissipates to a ring of small bubbles around edge of glass. Little light passing through. Smell is straight up bourbon and caramel. Taste follows the nose. Pick up bourbon immediately transitioning to sweet caramel and some spiciness I can't quite put my finger on. Alcohol burn lingers and becomes a little off-putting for my taste. Definitely a sipper at 11.6%. Thicker mouthfeel which I enjoyed in this beer. Overall nice beer to try but I've preferred lower ABV scotch ales to this.

Smells of barrel, toffee, certainly a bit of brown sugar. Taste is complex! Caramel, toffee, TONS of barrel, and a bit of hops. Other flavors in there too, but I love how the barrel comes through.    This is one of my favorite beers. It never disappoints me! If you enjoy BBA scotch ales, this is a must try. I snagged three four packs so I can one a month. Ages well.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Pours reddish brown with little head. Nose is full of coconut, caramel and barrel char. Palate has the caramel sweetness mix with some barrel charred burned sugar flavors. Doesn't taste 11.6 abv at all. I could sip on this all day, just the right mix of bourbon barrel and base beer. I find some barrel aged imperial stouts to be too much going on, too heavy. This is better in my opinion, a simpler base beer with some great barrel flavors. Only offputting thing is that there is some similarity to cough syrup on the nose and taste, but alot of bourbon aged beers have that characteristic.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 *Bottled 10/27/14    Pours a deep, garnet color with a modest cap of cream suds. Mild aroma smells of toffee, brown sugar, cherries, and vanilla. Swaths of speckled lacing adorn the glass as the beer recedes.    The taste is sweet and boozy up front, featuring brown sugar, toasted bread, cherry cough syrup, and woody, buttery bourbon with notes of vanilla. Mild, herbal hops lurk beneath the malt and bourbon foreground. Medium-heavy body and mild carbonation make for a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Palpable stickiness lingers on the lips between sips.    Overall, this is a nice scotch ale that might even be a little too barrel-forward, if I may say so. I don’t know if the fact that this bottle is pushing 17 months makes a difference, but that was my impression. Either way, there’s no denying the quality of the craftsmanship here.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 12 oz bottle from 2015 poured into a tulip glass    Appearance: Pours a dark carmelly brown color. Left a foamy and very light tan head that lingered for a minute or so. Lots and lots of solids suspended in this beer. Looks chewy.    Aroma: All carmel, malt and whiskey.    Taste: The carmel malt aroma carry through proportionately to the flavor. First you get a densely sweet and delicious malt, then the smoky whiskey barrel finish.    Mouthfeel: Thick and viscous sugary nectar. nice smooth finish that leaves a thin coating on the mouth and makes the flavor of the beer linger for a while. very pleasant.    Overall: I like the combo of a scottish ale with a barrel aging treatment, although the scottish ale varieties are admittedly not my favorite. The smoky whiskey flavors do a nice job of balancing the super sweet brew that it accompanies.

Sugary sweet aroma with bourbon notes, dark fruit, hint of vanilla. Taste is similar, complex blend of maple/brown sugar, bourbon, wood, raisins, burnt notes. None of the flavors overpowers. Some earthy bitterness lingers past the semi dry finish. A little booze coming through at the end. Medium mouthfeel. Very good brew, so many flavors.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Scary dude on label. I better like this. Nuff said.    Pours a very nice murky brown/copper ale with a nice sized cream colored head. Light lacing.    Nice sweet caramel aromas with some sweet malt and boozy bourbon soaked dark fruits.    Taste is long sweet malt yum, more caramel (like the aroma), bourbon, brown sugar, molasses and just a kiss of hop spice on the tongue. The booze warmness is definitely present but doesn't distract from each sip.    Overall this was a home run. Obviously the past reviews can attest to that, but I consider myself lucky to finally partake in all that is Founders. They know how to brew beer and this is a fantastic brew for the style. Hell it could probably win some Barleywine contests as well. Amazing stuff.

The palate follows the nose. The bourbon is appropriately subdued, and allows the Wee-Heavy notes (more rich toffee, molasses, and brown sugar) to come through more strongly. Mouthfeel is medium-thick/thick, with minimal carbonation. One of the quintessential Wee Heavies in my mind. An outstanding beer.
