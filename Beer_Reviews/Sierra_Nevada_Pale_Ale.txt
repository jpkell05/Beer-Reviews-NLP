Not a style I drink as often as others, but I like to mix it up from time to time. A good representation of the style. Hoppy. Medium carbonation. Seems pale ale and IPA is a pretty easy style to do. Most of these taste about the same. Really hard to mess up a pale or an IPA.

Color is amber, nice and clear.     Smell of pine and citrus.     Taste is grapefruit bitterness up front, then pine, a floral hop finish then rounded out by the caramel malt that's necessary to balance this hop forward American Pale Ale.    Clean and crisp with medium-high carbonation, this is an all occasions beer that pairs well with a wide variety of foods.      I'm reviewing this beer after drinking it many, many times. It's like running into an old friend and thinking, "What could we possibly have to talk about" but then before you know it you're laughing, reliving old glories and catching up on new events.     Excellent. Hightly recomended. If I had to put together my perfect flight of beer, this would make the cut.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Pours a creamy white head. Color is a crystal clear pale amber.     Nose is crackers and toast with floral and citrus. Some dried citrus fruit in there as well.     Taste starts lightly bitter with toasty malt character. The middle opens up to a more crackery malt note with, with the hop flavors opening up to present dried citrus and floral notes. The finish opens up more of the bitterness and just slightly dries the mouth, making you want another sip. There is a sweetness that rides throught the entire sip that is never overpowering.     The mouthfeel is the slightest bit aqueous, but not so much that it's a turn off. The carbonation is right where it needs to be for an APA (this is THE APA, so it's expected.     Overall, you really can't go wrong with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. It's the one of the standard APAs that every beer drinker has had at least once, and it's always pleasant to go back to it. A perfect partner for a good burger and a solid way to introduce somebody to the wonderful world of hoppy American bears.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours a beautiful clear amber, thin white head and active carbonation.  Smell is malty sweet with notes of apple, pine and caramel. Very pleasantly cohesive and complex.   Taste is wonderfully crisp, piney and grassy notes lead, into a lightly caramel/rich malt body, it all tails of into a piney/citrusy hop finish. Classic for a reason, this is a taste that is hard to get sick of.  Mouthfeel is super clean, definitely a drinker. Leaves nothing but refreshment behind.   Overall this is an undisputable classic in the american beer market. For those of us deep in the modern craft scene it can seem out dated or passe but as someone deep in a stint of modern IPAs and big stouts I can testify to the refreshing, crisp delight this beer still brings. Don't be scared, it's just a classic

Sierra makes them too.

From the clean amber color to the lovely floral scent, the piney elements in the full-bodied taste, it is my 'house' beer, hands down.

Aroma is pale and light bready malt with floral and citrus hops. Taste is similar but more robust with citrus and a little pine in the hop profile. Finishes dry, astringent, peppery and bitter.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 IPAs everywhere owe this beer a thank-you card. It is the gateway to the bitter, soapy world of IPA. Slightly bitter yet still a little sweet taste. Floral but not intimidating scent. Toasty color and moderate head. Pours nice into your everyday pint glass. A great overall beer and a great way to try something new if you’ve been stuck to macros.

All this beer is, is a near perfect display of simplicity and quality. With the exception of a few rotating local brews I cycle in, this is my go-to when eating dinner or just relaxing after work.     With the already abundant collection of reviews, I'd rather skip the formality and just talk about my favorite part: The hoppy, "spicy" bite at the end. To me, this truly does set this pale ale apart from others. Some are too smooth and don't have enough attitude, but this has a perfect punch. Nice smooth beginning, citrus and light hoppy notes, and then, the moment that makes you want more. A slightly dry finish into a tantalizing sightly bitter, fairly hoppy, and perfectly spicy ending. This beer likely won't hit your novelty-seeking dopaminergic threshold, but it deserves a spot in any rotation when you just want a really good beer.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Wow! Wonderful tasty delightful ale! Exceptional in every thing.  Looks nice, I love the presentation. Looks like a classic and iconic beer. The aroma is a blast of brightness, grapefruit citrus with light hints of malt. Smells like a summer day when all the kids on the block have a fruity ice pop or snow cone. The taste is where it gets good. Wonderful top end sweetness that leads straight into those American citrusy hop notes. Grapefruit lingering around with a backbone of malt. The finish is semi dry with hop bite bitterness in the end. That semi dryness leads you to want another sip. Over the time drinking, the hops begin to build, making the beer rich and feeling very satisfied. The feel is light to medium with a bit of body. The carbonation is medium. Very smooth and easy to drink. Its a winner and a new American Classic. Credited as the Godfather of Craft beer movement. I can see why. Its damn good!

Something that reminds me of a lager for some reason, still very good.  Taste: a good balance between hops and malt, as expected from an APA. Hops is more on the grassy side than as I would have thought from the smell, with some citrus notes to go with it. Malty flavours rather biscuit-y. Some alcohol as well, but subdued enough. Probably the most textbook I've ever drunk.  Feel: medium to light body with still a touch of silkiness. Warmth from the alcohol without burning. Classic.  Overall: It may not shock and awe. Most probably, if you're an user of this site it won't. Yet it's got everything and doesn't miss much else. Very enjoyable.

Very nice.    Taste is clean, malty sweetness, lemon, bit of spice. Not much pine or bitterness, definitely more malty than hoppy, but it’s a well balanced and refreshing beer.     Medium light bodied, solid carbonation. Clean and smooth drinking. An enjoyable very sessionable ale.    Very good APA that still holds well its legend status as a pioneer of the craft boom. Exemplary for the style. Easy 8/10 beer for me overall, 10/10 in the style.

It's simply as fine a crafted American Ale as can be had!

Generous head is slow to dissipate, leaving a nice lacing on the glass.  Smells great - fresh malt, sweet tropical fruit, slight hop aroma. Sierra Nevada always seems to have that fresh crafted beer smell  Taste is crisp and refined. Not a massive bitterness but pine is a featured flavor. Also getting various citrus and slight pineapple. Can really tasted the malted barley on the back end. Goes very well with Italian and Mexican food. Not as complex or rich as the Torpedo IPA but that is to be expected, this is very solid for what it is designed to be, a very drinkable but tasty brew.  Grade is an A-   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Perhaps the definitive American Pale Ale. Hoppy but ridiculously drinkable. A great way to introduce someone to craft ales.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 This is a decent beer. The most impressive thing about this beer, for me, is that it operates in two separate consciousnesses. On one hand, the hoppy, fruity, and piney aromas and first sips make the drinker immediately aware that this beer has piggy-backed off of a trend towards more unnecessary hop action while a fine beer hides underneath. Such a move pacifies the beer hipsters, no doubt, but this beer is, fortunately, worthy of more praise than simply acknowledgement over the adequate execution of a trend. I can taste a simple, solid American ale beneath all of the pretense. A hit of corn, of wheat, of that perfect ale balance hides in the aftertaste, wishing it could have been realized.

On the dark side for a pale, the color is clear amber.  Sweet toasted malt and piney hops dominate the smell.  Taste is floral and piney hops at first with a very malty middle, followed by a spicy/bitter hop finish.  Medium/light body is rounded off by the high semi-sweet malt presents and medium carbonation.   On the dark side for the style, the malt bill is noteworthy. Lots of hops yet balanced. I do like single hop beers.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I had a draft served in a large frosty mug in a restaurant last night where I usually order a Sam Boston lager, but they've discontinued it on draft. This 'pale ale' is much darker than its name suggests. A rich amber with a good head, quite lacy. It smells enticing. The flavor is full bodied rich and pleasant, not far off my go-to Sam Adams. I'd be happy to drink it again.    Taste Test  Samuel Adams Boston Lager vs. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale  Appearance: Very similar, clear Amber with a white head. The Pale Ale is perhaps slightly paler. Sam's head is perhaps slightly more persistent  Smell: Too similar for me to differentiate, as one who is olfactorily disabled.  Feel: Sam is perhaps slightly more carbonated  Flavor: Pale Ale has the faintest hint of hops  Overall: These two beers, despite one being a lager and one being an ale, are remarkably similar. Both are good.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Pours a clear, deep gold/light amber coloration with a medium, fizzy head. Smells faintly of biscuity, bready malt, with a certain graininess coming through as well and the merest hint of citrus and pine. Taste is a good balance of biscuity malt and citrus hops, with just a hint of pine coming through and an underlaying grainy and slightly flowery note. Finishes with crisp, light/medium bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel with a light/medium body and medium carbonation. I wasn't gonna review this as first, as my bottle is a good six months old. However, reading the other reviews and knowing that SN are actually masters of brewing beers that keep well, I feel that the beer is actually supposed to have this slightly understated malt/hop presence, which is kind of typical of a classic, old school Pale Ale, I suppose. It's well balanced, crisp and easy-drinking, but lacks a certain bite and doesn't really seem that special. Maybe it really is better fresh, who knows. EDIT: Having an 11 week old bottle now and while it does have that understated aroma/flavour to it, the citrus notes do seem somewhat more vibrant than I remember them.

Great beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Bottled 1/16/18, consumed 3/10/18    Poured crystal clear deep amber with a small head that left a little bit of lacing.    Aroma is most toasted bread, very up front and dominating. Some malt notes, maybe a bit of spices faintly, but I didn't really get anything related to hops.    Taste follows aroma and is all toast. Very old school, other end of the spectrum from a lot of hoppy pale ales these days. Slightly more spicy notes. There is a prevalent funkiness in the yeast or something that is not found in a lot of pale ales or IPAs these days (except Belgian ones obviously). I honestly didn't get much fruit, pine, or other hop notes.     Mouthfeel is medium, pretty refined feeling, good bitterness.    Overall, more bready and malty than I'm looking for in pale ale. I can easily see why this has been a timeless classic; that being said there are quite a few other more hop-forward, year-round pale ales these days that I prefer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from bottle to pint glass. Copper color and a nice few fingers of foam. Balanced in every respect: not too sweet or bitter, but crafted in a way that the malt is clearly delineated from the lemon zest/grapefruit/piney hops. Clean finish.

Nice crisp lager easy finish. Easy to drink a 6 pack but not as bad as commercial light lagers. My least favorite from Sierra Nevada but still not bad.

Had this beer dozens of times, never knew I haven't rated in the past. Amber pour with white head. Beautiful hops aroma, love the aroma and taste. Nice balance of hops and malt, bitter and pleasant. Very solid mouth feel, carbonation holds well, firm going down. Overall very good Pale Ale, well done Sierra Nevada!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.5 This beer is true to the style of IPAs. It's not too hoppy like a lot of other American IPAs.. Poured into a standard pint glass, I got a finger of head with moderate carbonation. The smell is beautiful with cascade hoppes being the most prominent. When you drink it, you immediately notice the hop profile along with a good balance of malt backbone. The finish is a light bitterness from the cascade hoppes that leaves fuji wanting another sip. If someone were to ask me what is an IPA Style Beer this is what I would show them! All around fantastic go to beer year around.

Extremely well balanced--all components of the flavor come together and form a smooth synergy, nothing in particular stands out. The mouthfeel is full and creamy (simply taking swigs from a bottle generates a thick head inside of the bottle) while the beer still manages to be refreshing. Maybe the most easy drinking beer I've ever had.

Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy, amber/gold type color with a short, frothy white head.    Aroma: Clean and fruity. Some pine and hop. Maybe apricot, grapefruit.    Taste: Follows nose. Really a terrific pale ale - pops with fruity flavor and hops without being even slightly overpowering. Grapefruit's there, some more citrusy taste is there. Faint winey type note.    Mouthfeel: Super drinkable. You just want to drink this all day.    Overall: A classic beer. Template for a lot of much more expensive beers, and it's better than most of them.

Several of our convenience stores in my city keep this on hand regularly. When I can’t get to the craft beer shop the next town over, I usually grab a 6-pack of this. Beautiful golden color. It has a nice pine-citrus aroma. It has a citrusy taste with a wheat finish. It has a pleasant lingering aftertaste. It has a great feel as you sip (or chug). Sierra Nevada pale ale is a solid choice for an everyday ale.

Pours a dark orange/amber with a small/med head. The carbonation is very present and inviting through a glass. Nose has citrise and the floral cascade hops come through very well. First off, there's carbonic bite, followed by citrisey, orangeyness. Then a malt sweet followed by a distinct drying bitterness that almost begs you to enjoy this slowley. There's not a ton a body but certainly a ton going on from start to finish. Which is why I will continue to drink this ale as a go to!

I am biased towards this beer because I have hauled many loads out of their Chico brewery over the last 18 years and they have always been exceptionally nice.     Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is the quintessential example of its style.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Served from tap into a conical pint glass at Red Rooster in Cutchogue, NY.   A: Pours a clear, inviting amber to light copper color with a one inch head, solid retention and elaborate lacing.   S: Bouquet of lemon citrus and pine overlay and caramel maltiness.   T: Elements of palate follow nose, but caramel malt backbone predominates. Bitterness nicely subdued, but contributed to complexity and crisp finish.   M: Light to medium bodied. Solid carbonation.   O: At or near the top of the style. Subtle and complex.

Yes, the hops are prevalent but it’s really the malt backbone which takes the cake. Beautiful amber coloring with enough bubbles to make it look like you’re drinking a real beverage.    This beer does an amazing job hitting a slightly higher than 5.0 abv while also being full flavor and not watery. One of my all time faforties.

It is smooth with a good aftertaste too. I like it.  Feel: So smooth! Best beer I've tried all week! this beer is something a little bit strong for me, but when in the mood for something decent, i just paid 3.49 for a 1 pint 8 oz beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 My first truly great American beer, which I originally came across in Northern California in the mid-80s. Found some reasonably fresh bottles at the Safeway and realized I'd never reviewed it.     Pours a clear deep gold. Three fingers of foam creates the definitive "dense and rocky head." Good lacing.     Smell is initially fresh pine resin and sweet citrus, which gives way to more earthy and floral notes. Taste follows, with a pleasantly bitter finish. Feel has substance for the ABV but super drinkable.     This beer was radically amazing 30 years ago. Now it's a fine classic.

S: Tangerine, citrus and some malt sweetness. The smell just invites a large sip.  T: Not citrus like you would expect from the aroma. Pine, orange zest, grass.  O: An good offering from a stellar brewery. Well put together pale ale. I enjoy the faint citrus taste with the dry, hop finish. One could wish for a larger selection of Sierra Nevada beers to make it into Ontario. Although a classic, I feel they make better and it would be great to get a hold of some.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a clear glass.     Very clear and rich amber color and moderate carbonation. Thick head. Smells piney and has a refined barley aroma. Tastes somewhat wheaty and heavily floral, fairly spicy in the hops, a citrusy hint, but all very smooth. Pretty complex, but very well-rounded.    Good beer.

look: 4 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 Well. The classic pale ale, the one that started it all, I get it. Craft, yet mass produced and widely available at a good price point, I get it.  The goal posts keep moving. We have APAs hopped like IPAs, IPAs that taste like DIPAs, DIPAs made to knock you unconscious. You go back to this one and what do you get? An underwhelming amber colored ale with a faint aroma of citrusy hops and bready/grainy malt, a bitter, dry taste with some balancing sweetness, medium body, and a short slightly bitter finish.  Maybe I'm just hooked on the current trends, but for now I'm enjoying the ride. Returning to this classic is jarring. I'm glad it's around, but I won't get another one anytime soon.

look: 3.25 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3 From a 500ml can served at 10 degrees Celsius into a tulip. The beer warmed up to room temperature during consumption. Best before date: 16.09.2017    Look: The beer pours a clear medium amber with 4cm of off-white head that fades into a partial film in 2+ minutes.    Aroma: Faint intensity even after warming. Some citrusy, piney hops with balancing pale malts. A bit soapy. Lackluster.    Taste: Same as the aroma, nothing to add. The finish is short, faint, and bitter.    Feel: Medium body with lively carbonation. Crisp.    Overall: It's never a good sign if I'm in the middle of a review and I get distracted and start doing other stuff. It happened with this beer and I came back to finish what I started at room temperature. I'm disappointed but I will probably try it again on draft or a bottle when given the chance and nothing more interesting is available. I really don't understand the high ratings.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Flowers, forest and citrus aroma upfront. Pour is golden clear, but last inch landing makes it hazy and full of hoppy particules. Frothy, steady head. 2 fibgers tall, not persisting but leaving a decent lacing. Aroma included some moderate light biscuity notes.  High hop flavor. Moderate bitterness and moderate, grainy sweetness.  Medium body, watery, medium high carbo. Salty. Long bitter finish bit astringent. Perfumy alcohol.    Not bad!

Taste is sweet malts forward followed by good citrus hops. Nice balance. Nothing outstanding.    Good carbonation lends it way to a smooth medium mouthfeel.    Overall a good drinkable beer. Quite sessional.

Great representation of the style and one of my top three SN beers. Good price for a 12 pack.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Clear copper/amber, one finger head.    Smells grainy/bready mostly, with a slight fruity touch. Alcohol kinda muddies everything, very surprising on a 5.6% ABV brew. Piney aromas after it warms.    Taste is much more fruity: lime, citrus. Mango? A bit peppery and spicy, sweet. Apples too. Alcohol is very present but doesn't blend in very well. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Honey.    Very light carbonation. Kinda heavy.    Interesting. It's sweeter than most APA's I'm used to, but not overbearingly so. All in all, it's a bit stiff: it tastes nice, but it's a bit "dense", if that makes any lick of sense to you. Nothing really pops, it's a bit too uniform.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 When I want an APA that is easy going and easy to find and not watered down by some company that doesn't care about beer (like AB). This is what I reach for.  Pours a nice light semi-golden color yielding a one finger white head in my pint glass. Foamy speckled lacing graces the sides of the glass nicely. The smell is centered around some spicy yet grassy sweet hops, malts only slightly come out as the beer warms. Same as the taste, the palate is moderately carbonated with bitter aftertaste and finish. Overall, good for style and good for me.    This may be a simple one, but it's an APA and I don't expect it to be in the same ring as Heady Topper, a Crooked Stave Sour or even Deschutes' The Abyss. I think most people get my point if they're reading this. Cheers to great easy drinking APA's that go steady with easy to find food.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 A nearly perfect brew, I poured it into a pint glass at just above freezing temperature, it poured with nearly no head (perhaps because I had it cold as possible) yet appeared highly carbonated, the color was a perfect amber, the smell is sweet and hoppy, the taste is an almost perfect blend of hops and sweetness , the only complaint I have about the taste is I got a bitter aftertaste that seemed strange, this may be from my own mouth though and not the beer. Overall, highly recommended, my second favorite full flavor ipa thus far

This gives a 2 finger head.   The color is a medium cloudy straw, because some yeast is left in the bottle.   The aroma is a slight piney citrus.   The taste is a distinct piney crispness with light notes of citrus. Bitterness is moderate toward the middle to back of the palate with a hint of malt which offers a smooth finish. I just find this to be one of the best palate cleansing, refreshing beverage any time of the year.  Overall, this has been my go-to beer since Ballantine XXX Ale went out of business.

I've enjoyed this beer both as draft as well as bottled. My review delves mostly into my experience drinking from the bottle. The color is a dark cloudly straw, owing to the bottle conditioning that leaves some yeast in each bottle. A creamy head lingers. The smell is fairly subdued, giving off more hints of citrus than Cascade hops. The taste however makes up for this by asserting the crispness of the hops which are complemented by light notes of citrus. Bitterness is mild to moderate due to the beer's maltiness which offers a smooth finish. As mentioned before, this is my go-to pale which I find can be enjoyed on nearly any occasion.

The beer is bright orange copper in color with thick off white head and strong lacing. The aroma is caramel malt and a hint of citrus. The taste follows with caramel and a slightly bitter citrus finish. Mouthfeel is full, adequately carbonated and semi dry. Overall, very good and most likely unbeatable in it's price range.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 This beer pours a nice Amber color. The head was white. Nice lacing on the glass.  The nose is minimal.

Craft beers are well known of their selected and high quality ingredients and the mastery of their brewing. Brewmasters are like artists who compose a masterpiece by putting the right amount of ingredients together and combining them in the right way to achieve a unique brew, outstanding taste, smell, feel - and nonetheless, experience.  I am convinced that when we drink a masterfully brewed craft beer, our impression is different based on the type and amount of ingredients, let alone how and where they have been made or grown. Sierra Nevada has shown me that an unparalleled greatness exists in the art of master brewing by creating a true experience in a bottle: their own, one and only Pale Ale.  I am not an advocate of uncontrolled substances but I must admit that having had a pint of this Pale Ale I was overwhelmed by the great Nature of the Californian woods and mountains of the Sierra Nevadas, the foothills of the Rockies. I felt for the first time in my life that the Cascade hops grown in Californian soil and raised by the sun and rain of that microclima convey an experience through the natural water, grains and yeast of California, as if I were there if I closed my eyes, as if I could feel its wind on my skin, could smell the air of the Pacific or of the depth of the shadowy forests and could even hear the rustling of the trees, the gurgling of a nearby stream... as if that scenery on the label has come alive.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is such a psychedelic beer. When you drink it, you intake nature in its purest form and you travel through time and space to re-live something wonderfully natural.  A masterpiece in brewing beer, a perfect harmony of tastes and a depth like no other. This is a must for all BeerAdvocate. This is the Alpha and Omega of (American) craft brewing IMHO.

Bitterness is kept in balance by warm malt, hint of light caramel and white bread. Finish is very long with a really nice nuttiness from yeast. Finishes dry but not abrasive. Delicious.

They've been pumping this pale ale out for decades now and they have established themselves as a leader in brewing industry.    I didn't like this beer the first time I tried it (18-19). That's the thing about it: you get used to it. It has so many flavors going on at once that it can be difficult to understand for noobie beer-drinkers. Eventually you'll find a new flavor to enjoy every time you take a sip. I simply have yet to find a pale ale that is as consistent, delicious, and reliable as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. I personally associate it with many great Northern California memories over the past 15 years.    Get one ridiculously ice cold, pour it into a frozen beer glass, and enjoy on the hottest summer day of the year. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Poured from bottle, 1.5 finger head with significant lacing. Hazy light brown almost bronze colour. The smell is of straight up cascade hops and a little bit of acidity. The smell translates directly into flavor, with the cascade hops up front on the palette. There is a citrus almost lemon-lime element present, and a weak malt backbone is also present but doesn't add much for balance or sweetness. As it warms it seems to get more bitter. My bottle did not have very significant carbonation, which I found slightly strange since I've had this beer plenty of times before and it did. Maybe someone shook the bottle. YMMV with that. Mouthfeel was as you'd expect a pale ale to be otherwise, a little on the thin side.   Overall this is one of my go to beers when I'm looking for something a little more hoppy. It's flavor is heavily skewed towards hops over the malt and makes a nice change of pace without completely obliterating your taste buds like a full on IPA does. The 37 IBU rating seems low. If you like cascade hops, try this!

Thick creamy off white head that stands 1 finger tall with very good retention and sticky lacing.Light orange colored body with good clarity,and small amounts of sediment.Very low carbonation with a hard pour.    On the nose I get piney and floral hops with earthy,sweet,and caramel malts.Not much else,kind of a subdued and uneventful aroma,though not unpleasant.    On the palate I get sweet and caramel malts up front,piney hops in the middle,and floral hops balanced by earthy malts on the back end.    The mouth feel is medium with a sticky texture,dry finsh,and good amount of oxidation on the tongue.    This is a pretty solid APA,not my favorite but definitely up there.Good malt / hop balance with a nice bitter backbone.I've had it before this,and will drink it again.Recommended if for some reason you haven't tried it yet.

While everything is quite average, ie not great, not bad, I especially don't like the unbalanced after bitter taste. While it's drinkable because of it's complex fruity smell, it's only good for pairing for light food, ie, not too tasty nor too salty food.

Quality of most , in not all, Sierra products is one reason I continue to support this brewery. This is the "gateway" beer into craft beer for many people. Not much can be said about this beer that hasn't been said 3000 times. I spent a month in Erope and I was shocked to find out that the only American made beer served in the hotel was Sierra Nevada Pale. A great, smooth beer, great price , well made !

Hazy orange amber in color, the pour forms up very thick creamy off-white head that stays with remarkable retention before slowly sinking to an eternal foamy layer on the surface and leaving plenty of sticky lacing patch and spot.    Lots of biscuity malt as a base in a nose, hop discloses slightly thereafter with notes of pine, floral, spicy, earthy, citrus, and grapefruit.    Delicious and great balance, sweet and biscuit malt lays as the backbone of the flavor structure while hop comes into play providing its spicy, earthy, pine, citrus, grapefruit, and medium resiny bitterness.    Medium body with good crispness and some lively carbonation, smooth mouthfeel, dry finish.    Classic APA indeed, it is well-rounded and perfectly balance. A truly inspired beer.

That being said to me its a little to crisp and bitter, not super smooth or easy drinking. Kind of thin and not thirst quenching. Definitely not a bad beer just nothing special to me, more of an east coast guy I guess.

Lots of stick-to-the-glass lacing.    Smell was a nice balance of resinous, floral, and citrus hops supported by a biscuity malt smell. Wonderful, the citrus was just a hint.    The taste followed along, with a bit of bitterness up front, then the hops come in with the floral, milder than expected resin, then a bit if brightness from the citrus that seems more orange or tangerine than the usual grapefruit. Well-balanced, nice malt presence that put me in mind of a pilsener. A little biscuit, a little sweet.    Medium to light on the body, drying enough to invite another sip. Carbonation in the just right zone.    Overall, this is a great beer and I believe you have to add in the value. Available just about everywhere year round and at a very reasonable price. Good take on the style, SN delivers a well-balanced, flavorful beer.

I live in PA close to the DE border where I get a 12-pack of each in cans for less than $30. I appreciate IPAs, strong ales from Belgium, seasonals, stouts, etc., but these are my day-to-days.    Why? Four reasons: 1. balance, 2. quality, 3. availability, 4. price. Price has become a dirty word on beer review sites but these beers represent a great value. They're fantadtic representations of their respective styles produced in high enough volume to make them widely available at a fair price without resorting to gimmicks.     Plenty of others give descriptions of look, flavor, taste. Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is a high-quality brew that rivals the great beers of Germany but is uniquely American. It's just fantastic. The day I tire of SNPA is the day I tire of beer.

L: Pretty golden color with thick three finger white head that slowly recedes into a lasting finger head. Great lacing that stays put.     S: Spicy, floral and earthy almost crushed leaves hop smell initially, transforms into a mellow biscuity aroma.     T: Smoothness like a straight razor shave consisting of sharp crisp bitterness from the hops to begin the complexity of this beer. You get a wonderful menagerie of floral, citrus, earthen and spicy hops. Mellowing out from there the malted barley comes through to take hold. Very well balanced.     F: The medium to low body of this beer with the refreshing balanced complexity to create one of the most easily drinkable beers out there.     O: I recently developed a taste for hoppier beers that thus far I heavily disliked. After realizing this I decided i must try one of the all-time American Pale Ale staples. I was swept away by this beer and will recommend this to most anyone. Well done Sierra Nevada.

While it has inspired countless breweries to start a hops and IBU arms race, Pale Ale is here to stay for what you go back to when you want a taste of perfection. Not only is it the benchmark for taste, but also price and availability. If service is the rent we pay for living, Pale Ale is the rent Sierra Nevada pays to the world of beer.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 12oz pkgd 09/07/16. Pint glass. Brassy orange color, moderate white head, crystal clear as SN is want to do. Piny and citrusy hop aroma, which could easily be an IPA. Flavor comes through strong with that same one-dimensional hop sharpness, but finishes with a biscuit malt aftertaste of toasted grain and a hint of caramel. But the bitter and sweet flavors don't work together and compliment each other. Rather, the malt flavor only serves to disqualify this beer from being a hoppy, West coast IPA.    As a pale ale I find this beer to be a failure, and as an IPA, it's just not very good. I deeply regret this this beer has become a benchmark for American Pale Ale, because I think there are some great APAs, and they don't taste anything like this one. I would much prefer this beer broken down into its components and served to me as separate ales: the aroma, bitterness, malt body, and color are all fine, but don't belong together in the same glass.    I do think this beer may be better in a fresh bottle than on tap.

It pours a pale orange color with one finger of milky-white head and lacing with excellent retention. The smell features grass, pine needles, floral hops, and a whiff of citrus. The taste opens with a nice malt base with grapefruit and a blast of bitter hops. It is super dry and crisp. It's moderately carbonated and with a 5.6% ABV it's very easy to drink. There's a reason this is considered a classic: it's consistently well-crafted, tasty, and refreshing. This is a great beer with which to introduce a friend to the world of craft.

Rolling Rock used to compare when it was brewed by Latrobe but now it's brewed by Annheiser Busch and is awful. Sierra Nevada stays true to its roots and now brews the only delicious pale ale I can think of. Not to mention it is the beer that got me into IPA's, took me,away from commercial beers, first to inform me there are better brews out there , and it is Sierra Nevada's signature. An American classic. Although better straight out of the bottle this time poured into a tulip:  Look: golden with a fluffy head.  Aroma: pine and citrus.  Feel: medium, malty, and hoppy.  Taste: spicy, floral, earthy, piney, malty, hoppy, citrus, and a lameness dryness only found in Sierra and Rolling Rock.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Nice color. I'm getting a subtle scent of citrus and pine on the nose with a nice malt in the background. Everything is working for this beer so far. Ok, so I'm getting a lot of subtle flavors. It's got some hop bitterness and citrus notes to start then flowing into a nice malt finish. I would not call this a bitter beer. It's somewhat carbonated and slightly dry on the finish. Nothing overpowering here but a solid good tasting and well balanced beer. I like this.

The body is med to full and finishs dry leaving you waiting for another sip. Excellent!    This beer still hold up to this very day and the quality of the beer speaks for it self. This beer came out in 1980. Imagine drinking it then for the first time, a bottle conditioned, all natural, hoppy pale ale with no fillers!     What can I say, A beloved classic, a pioneer in American craft brewing, a beer that has truly stood the test of time, a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.

Smells of cut pine and citrus rind, biscuity caramel malt, wet stone and freshly cut flowers.    Tastes of lightly honeyed bread crust, orange and grapefruit rind and more sappy pine.    Feels soft and fluffy. Medium bodied with frothy carbonation. Finishes dry.    Verdict: Recommended. Tasty and easy to drink.

M: Medium bodied also a little lighter very bubbly on the tongue though.     O: It isn't a bad beer but probably one of my least favorites from this brewery. It isn't exceptional in any way shape or form.

Simple and nice.    Mouthfeel: medium bodied, the right carbonation, crisp and refreshing. Grapefruit aftertaste.    Overall: a very nice and enjoyable APA, a simple one. Refreshing, good taste and mouthfeel.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 This flagship APA pours a light orange color with a medium foamy off-white head. The smell is fairly hoppy with citrus notes and some slightly lighter pine notes. The taste is fairly similar with some orange and grapefruit citrus tones dominating and an undercurrent of pine and malty slightly sweet, toasted bread flavors. The body is light to medium and the finish is semi-dry. Overall it’s a crisp and refreshing beer. The hoppiness is quite restrained compared to many other APAs that I’ve had (especially from California), but when this first came out I’m sure it was considered pretty hoppy. I personally prefer it to some of the hop bomb APAs that I’ve tried, though I’m sure that many would disagree with me. To me this is a simple beer, but one that is has great clean flavors and nice balance, for sure a classic.

O: I have always been a stouts/porters guy and I am just starting to venture out into pale ales/ IPAs etc... I know this is one of the gold standard American pales ales, so I thought I would give it a go. Nothing big and bold about this but it is enjoyable. It would make a good session beer.

Still perfectly balanced and immensely drinkable. Great beer!   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3 Ah my first ale of any kind pale, or IPA. This was introduced to me years ago by my friend Brian Watring. I think my thoughts at the time were bitter, Christmas tree along that line. This gave me a fine appreciation of the soon to try IPAs which I came to enjoy.  Poured into a English pub glass. Orange, golden colour, almost like an Oktoberfest.  Aroma off the bat, metallic, much like Yuengling Lord Chesterfield, or maybe thats cause I just read my review of that one, smell again..no, definitely metallic, but not off putting. Dry,  Its been awhile, but the piney notes I dont really find anymore. More of a dry hop, dry malt, biscuit taste. Light easy drinking beer. Very good, although I know not as intriguing as when I first sipped the "green goblin". The price is still reasonable for a craft brew.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Don't revisit this as often, and for some reason, never rated it before. 12 oz can from 6/13/16 poured into a Guinness style pint glass. Pours a clear, golden orange with a half finger of fluffy white head. Retention goes down to a thin lace at medium speed. Aroma is full of pine, mild citrus, and a tinge of cracker. The flavor matches the nose, with a very crisp semi-bitter finish. The feel is medium light, with a medium level of carbonation. One of the original session beers, and definitely one of the first non macro beers that got me steered in the right direction. Bring the pale back America.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 12 oz bottle poured into English pint glass.    L - Pours a clear, copper-amber color with a dense, creamy off-white head that remains throughout. Nice lacing sticks to the sides. Microbubbles are streamy and effervescent. It just looks like a nice beer from a nicely-designed bottle.    S - In putting my nose to the glass, it's not as strong, or overpowering, as I'd expected. Slight piney hop, grainy malt, citrus rind. Typical of most pale ales I've drank.    T - Very balanced between hops and malts, just the right amount of bittersweet. Starts out with a strong citrus/pine hop bite. Malty biscuit sweetness and citrus fruit follows. A nice, dry, slightly spicy finish that's very pleasant.     F - Light-to-medium bodied, moderate carbonation, almost drinks like a light beer but very smooth and drinkable.     O - Have had this on tap and in bottles and cans. Still one of my favorites, just now having one and rating it in honor of late musician Elliott Smith's birthday (he drank it/liked it). It's definitely a very well-balanced, solid representation of an American pale ale. Bitter and hoppy but also sweet and smooth, great for summer and year-round. Cheers.

A pefrect example of this style is of course the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  Look: Pouring it in a Nonic glass, it has a dark orange, amber, kinda coppery color. Very pale and "dirty" with some low carbonation and a 1/2 finger white foamy head.  Aroma: Mild aroma, very citrusy (smells like pine) with hints of caramel and tones of bitter fruits and roast malt.  Taste: Smooth & dry feel, and bitter from the hops with some standard carbonation  Overall, is a great American handcrafted beer and a classic example of the American Pale Ale style. Very drinkable and affordable. A must try. Cheers

Drank immediately before one of the newly popular low abv session IPAs(blue point). This blows that beer away in terms of hop character, body and overall drinkability.

Going back to the body, it's yellow perfect appearing to be almost a pilsner.  S: The aroma has hints of banana and citrusy profiles. It's very soft.  T & M: Can you imagine an awesome IPA with citrusy, kind of hoppy and mostly tropical flavors? Basically it's that but it lacks the bitterness in the end. It's soo great, it seems a beer made in heaven.  O: It's my first Sierra Nevada and I'm totally stoked. It's now clear to me why this beer is classical, it's really a higher product.

Once done it's not unpleasant just a generic tamed hoppiness between the citrus fruit (lemon-grapefruit) and pine needle domains. After a few minutes a quizzically alluring rotten smell seeps into the hop fumes.     The taste is overwhelmingly that of gritty, chewy pilsner, even slightly candied, grains and almost absent of what was expected in the aroma. The late aftertaste does harken back, however, to those lemon-like, bitter fruit hops. But it is the mouth-filling bread crust malt character which dominates.

Doesn’t go flat as lacing continues.    Smell: 3.75  Not very aromatic, but you can make out malt, hops, slightly tart fruit, citrus.    Taste: 4.5  Slight hop bitterness at first. Almost to an IPA level of hop bitterness. Quickly kicks into savory spices, citrus, peach, and mango. Its slightly sweet, but then dries out abruptly. Maltier and darker than expected (for something listed as a pale ale). Goes a bit to the bitter side on the tail end and hop flavors turn up the intensity.     Feel: 4  Right on the edge of light, but teetering on the medium bodied side. Feels a bit thin when the carbonation dies out.     Overall: 4.25  Great beer. Better than I expected. I have heard about S.N.’s Pale Ale and, since listed as a Pale Ale, I had stayed away from it. I tend to not like light Pilsners or Pale Ales, but this brew is better than a lot of IPAs that I have had. It is hoppier and maltier than I expected and very flavorful. I am pleasantly surprised with this one.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 A real classic—and still well-rated, despite its ubiquity, for good reason.     Good, if moderate, visible effervescence; nice golden-brown limpidity; solid head and superb lacing. Spicy notes of green-peppercorn and wet thyme floating upon an undercurrent of grapefruit juice and orange-rind; the malt expresses subtle sweet aromas, as well, but in the hopped mix these are transmuted to impressions of sticky citric sugars, like some sort of lemon-infused rock-candy. Refreshing flavors, never overwhelmed by this pale ale's medium-plus mouthfeel: more juiciness, with notes of grapefruit, lemon, d'Anjou pear, and pineapple, all of which is underwritten by a smooth, golden-malty texture, and all of which gives way to some malt-husk and herbaceous, thyme-hop bite.     A great sessionable ale that is, justifiably, the template on which so many subsequent APAs have innovated.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 I have been drinking this beer since the 90s and have have always considered it to be decent. It may not be a favorite, but I can remember so many occasions in which it was the best beer available, and I was truly grateful. The color is a nice amber color, and the smell is caramel malt and some grain. The flavor is malty, a bit sweet, with a bitter aftertaste. A bit watery on the finish. A solid beer though overall.

look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3 The Budweisser of Pale Ales? Maybe that's a bit harsh. The carbonation reminds me of a mass-produced American Lager, the malts seem non-existent, and the hops are an ugly mix of pine sap and bitterness. When I see this at a gas station, I grab it, because it's usually the best option you'll find there. Unfortunately it fits the mold of a gas station beer.

Smells of some citus hops but not enough to over power the sweet malt aroma. Tastes of citrus and pine but not overpowering. Leaves a nice bitter taste at the end. Apparent malt character. Feels smooth with medium carbonation. Overall an awesome pale ale, have had it many times and it never fails to be one of the best beers in the session.

Smell is mild and hoppy, lemon and a bit of pine. Good balance of flavors, a little bit of pine and some bread. A little lingering bitterness that doesn't last too long. Very drinkable, good all around beer. Certainly a summer time staple.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Well here we go, review #1801. . . and we have our second perfect 5 score.    Comes across an amazing beauty full of dark gold, caramel and amber appearance with just under 1" of white head. Aroma smacks of old school dry hopping with Cascades. Caramel notes from the malt.     Taste, just heaven, hoppy, yet a sturdy malt bill providing caramel backbone. Hop flavor is plenty of forest, grapefruit. A delicious bitter edge remains through the entire mouthfeel. A darker citrus edge throughout. Barely sweet malt presence that is smooth while the hops provide bitterness, and an almost Magnum hop like spice edge to it.    The absolute classic American pale ale.

Nor dense neither watery.... nice bubbling. Very drinkable and refreshing. Aftertaste is asome. An excellent beer.

Hops are the only thing I notice when I smell as my nose isn't the best at these things. Once I start drinking it starts really refreshing with a lingering bitterness. I'm not a giant fan of hoppy beers but this one manages to win me over. The only thing that I don't care for is the lingering bitterness. Having said that it isn't a big deal. Sierra Nevada Pale ale is a beer I've seen all over the place and haven't given its day in court for some time. I now understand its popularity is well earned.

This is a classic beer from Sierra Nevada - Always easy drinking, flavorful and well crafted. In the realm of APAs this is more earthy, bitter, and a touch spicy thanks to the cascade hops. Great balance between the hops and the malt here as this is a very balanced beer.

MJ's 1999 "Guide" gave it 4 of 4 stars (very rare) and said "it has a teasing balance between the piney Juniper-tasting Cascade hops and the fruitiness of the top-fermenting yeast."  Listed in the "1001", this classic deserves to be there and craft brewing would be different today were it not for this Pale Ale's offering a tasty alternative so early and making so much of the craft market.  Reviewed also and favorably in Roger Protz' CAMRA classic "300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 A few suspended particles away from crystal clear. Brilliant orange honey color, active bubbles, and decent foam retention along the top. Smells like a walk through a cool pine forest. Tastes piney and citrusy with a malty, biscuity finish. A biting mouth feel from all those bubbles. A quality, well-made APA that does it right.

Orange citrus, pine, and light grapefruit. On the light side of medium bodied. Crisp but smooth. Light malt lays down the base on the palate with a balancing bitterness and pine-rubbed orange. Finishes fairly dry and quick with fading citrus.    The first I had this beer I was blown away by it's bright citrus and solid bitterness but after years of palate shift, it just comes off mild and average.

Chilled to 38 degrees, poured into large wine glass.    Look: Hazy gold orange with 1/2 inch off white head that dissipated quickly leaving a ring of foam and light lacing. Good carbonation.    Smell: Overtones of citrus (orange and tangerine), spice and a light pine resin.    Taste: Citrus and pine hops balanced by a light malt sweetness. Spiced Dry finish. Lightly grassy aftertaste.    Mouthfeel: Full bodied and well carbonated, sharp.    Overall: Despite the age of this sample I was pleasantly surprised. This is a very drinkable pale ale but I want to try a fresher bottle and compare this review to the new one. This deserves a second look to see if the legend of this brew holds up.
