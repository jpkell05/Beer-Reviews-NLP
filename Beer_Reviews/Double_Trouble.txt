look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Double Trouble has an amber appearance with a surprisingly mild aroma (slight pine scent). I was surprised at the amount of malt in this beer, but it had a really good hop bite at both the front and the back of the taste. The feel, due to the malt, was slightly creamy. A very good Imperial IPA, even with the high malt content in the body (which itself was good, just unusual for an imperial style IPA).

Smell is fairly mild. Smells of corn and barley with a hint of hops. Surprisingly not a stronger smell.    Taste is hoppy both front and rear of mouth. Good balance with some seeeter malt but leaves a bitter aftertaste.    Mouthfeel is light with lower carbonation.    Overall a great IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 12-oz bottle into pint glass in October 2018. Bottled-on date of 05/17/18 listed on the label, and drank less than 1 month after purchase.    Appearance: Medium gold body with 2-finger light-tan head. Beer is a clear and brilliant coloring, and not much hazing like other Imperial IPAs. Head lasts a minutes before decreasing to a thin covering, and it leaves a lot of lacing on the glass.    Smell: Huge aroma filled with a strong hops aroma, and includes citrus, pepper, and pine smells. A little more sweet than some other IPAs or APAs. The aroma filled the area as soon as I opened the bottle.    Taste: There is a noticeable hops flavor, as expected from an IPA. There is strong bite from the hops along with other flavors like citrus, but the hops bitterness is not overpowering. This is not as bitter as some other IPAs. The aftertaste provides a variety of flavors over time. Not overly bitter or hoppy, and has a nice balance.    Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Strong alcohol, which matches the 9.4% posted on the label.    This is a smooth strong-bodied beer, that is easy to drink. It is a good and strong Imperial IPA, and is very well balanced. The aftertaste is really enjoyable. I would definitely drink this again.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 A: Poured a 2 finger head, very thick foam. It dissipates slowly, but a nice film is left over. Color is like a harvest orange zinfandel. The lacing clings nicely, almost like frosting.    S: Smell of pine, bright hops, pineapple, grass    T: A beautiful tug of ware between the hops and malt, with the bitter hops ultimately winning out. A light bitterness lingers for some time. There's sweetness, though I can't quite place where it's coming from, maybe pineapple or honey. There's a wheaty creaminess. This beer has my tastebuds beat.    O: I'm usually not a fan of DIPAs because they're typically just hop bombs. This one shows how it should be done. And when done well, the results are fantastic. This is simply a well crafted, complex, brew. Well done.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a medium amber with a well retained one inch white head that left excellent lacing. Smells of citrus, malts, pine and alcohol.

Medium bodied and carbonation, mildly dry finish that is also slightly sweet.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Deep copper gold color with off white color cap and lacing.    Aroma of rich malt overlain with piney, spicy, citrus hops.    Taste is richly malty with a strong hop presence. There's nothing mild mannered about this one as it pushes it's broad shoulders through the crowd in a way that you would notice even if you weren't looking. Malt is rich and deep with an equal hop presence marching alongside. Quite a mouthful, so to speak. A fairly complex flavor that's moreso in most all ways that I could describe a beer.    Full texture with balancing carbonation.    I don't see this as a food matching brew, or even one I would want in several doses. It is an interesting take on how much a brewer can cram into a beer when they put their mind to it. Some reviewers have mentioned a "booziness" that I don't notice but I take my whisky straight so what do I know. It won't knock a casual drinker over or grow hair on a bald man but this is one big boy take on beer.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a a medium coppery amber with a fine, two finger white head with great retention and thick lacing, looks nice. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus hops, orange, grapefruit, light stone fruit. Flavor follows with caramel malt, citrus and lightly tropical hops, orange, grapefruit, mango and light stone fruit, finishes with citrus and lightly piney hops with a little lingering lemon and orange. Medium bodied with light creaminess and good carbonation. A great traditional style imperial IPA with the caramel and citrus profile that I am always happy to return to after a few of the newer styles. My taste definitely runs to lingering caramel and aggressive hop bitterness with good herbal notes. Nicely done and welcome to our market (one of the last standard Founders to reach the northwest).

Deep golden colored body, with a finger or so of off-white head that settled after a few moments. Minimal lacing. This sample was three months past the bottling date, and was quite malt forward and boozy. The hop character had faded quite a bit, Still pretty tasty, though. A little sweet, with notes of honey, caramel malt, and earthy and grassy hops. Good mouthfeel, with a mostly dry finish and a little lingering sweetness. To be fair, I'll revisit this if and when I can find it fresh(er). Caveat emptor.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Founders is very reliable; I’m glad they’re distributing out west now. Double Trouble is a beautifully crafted DIPA that pours a pure gold tone with a nice off-white head. The nose is rich and strong, with heavier apricot-type fruits and some noticeable alcohol fumes. The taste is robust and complex with more subtle mango and pineapple fruit and lots of seriously bitter piney hops. Mouthfeel is just right. Overall: yum (and better watch out!).

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 This beer showed up on the shelves at my local Spec's and it was time for some big IPA's. Saw this on a list of the better IPA's surfing the site in the past so I grabbed it. The pour was more of a rich, darker gold and with a creamy finger or two of head. Smell is offensively good, some of the pine resin and dankness, a little bit of the West coast IPA vibe. Really delicious beer with a dialed in, uniformity to the hop bitterness and its balance with the sweet malts in the background. Lovely beer that I'd love to see and drink again. My friend concurred.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 12 oz bottle into tulip. Dated 5/17/18.  Great label.  Look is cloudy golden orange. Smell is light citrus and hops with malt at the end. Taste is exactly as nose. Hop (not really juicy) and then nice malt ending. Medium mouth feel. Overall a nice DIPA but not sure I would spend the money again.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 I was not impressed with this at all. Maybe I got a bottle too late or maybe Bells Oracle destroyed my palate on this but I was not impressed. I'd rather Founders discontinue this forever and use this beer to make Doom as a yearly seasonal, very much prefer Doom over this. I got some cloying lemon grass for flavor with lots of malt and booze flavor with little hop bite. Will only consume again if given for free.

Smell is pine dominant then a grapefruit citrus rind finish - big, strong, bitter.    Taste continues the aroma's path - big pine, solid citrus rind and pithiness, some notable malt sweetness but base malt, lighter herbal and grassy flavors as you finish.     Mouthfeel is excellent for a 9.4% brew - light sweetness, good lingering bitterness, perfect carbonation.    Overall a super easy drinking strong DIPA with great flavor, good aroma, and an excellently balanced mouthfeel.

This puppy pours a light and crisp golden amber with a decent thin head. Smell is of strong, almost west-coast, malts and a heavy aroma of bright and woodsy hops. The aroma is distinct yet, varies after every sip. The taste is in your face IBU's with a malt kicker. This beer does well to hide the 9.4% abv, and as such can NOT disappoint. The body is thin yet it packs a heavy punch to give an amazing beer! Do not pass on this.

Taste isn’t quite as robust - those flavors are still there just less muscular, nice classic PNW bitterness to contrast it on the backend. A little oily, but finishes pretty clean. A classic as far as a shelf IPA goes.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Bottled on 5/17/18    Pours a bright but dark copper-gold with hints of honey topped with a soft, white head which dissipates somewhat quickly and leaves lacing spattered all throughout the glass.    Smell is of wet, earthy hops with a hint of dankness; soft, sweet (nearly honeyed) malts round out the aroma really nicely.    The taste begins as an amalgamation of restrained herbal bitterness and builds slowly toward a sopping-wet dankness with bits of hemp that becomes almost overwhelming at times; so earthy and raw.    Mouthfeel is an interesting balance of both dry and sticky; low carbonation and an extremely subtle crispness finishes things off; no real trace of booze.     This is a straightforward and really well-put-together DIPA. The heavy, earthy qualities threaten its balance at times, but also allow it a character of its own. Overall, a good option to keep in mind if you're looking for a traditional hop bomb that balances precariously between overwhelming and just right.

The beer pours bright golden yellow with abundant off white head. Retention and lacing are well above average. The aroma is faint, as in, I can't really smell anything. Just some vague caramel sweetness. The taste is light caramel, a bit of earthy hops, and some residual alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. There is some hop shellac and old school feel, but relatively little booze for the ABV. Overall, very good. Somewhere amazing to me how fast this style has evolved. Drinks like 2010, but I like it.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. This brew pours out a nice looking clear golden color almost like an apple juice and has a thin off white colored crown. I like the clarity. The smell is piney and more dank smelling than any IPAs I've had in a while. It also has a little hemp or burnt hop oil quality to it. The taste is that same hemp/hop oil type presence followed by a malt sweetness that thickens up the drink. It's thick, wet and sticky. But overall, it just doesn't stick out from anything else. Definitely solid and well made tho.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A very smooth double! It has the bitterness I like, but lacks the citrus and piney taste I prefer. With multiple styles out there, this is more the old style that balanced. Well done, but not my style preference right now.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a clear gold. The nose is grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, and a little pine. The flavor is bitter orange, lemon, and bitter grapefruit peel, dry pine, and a savory touch of herbs, juniper berries, & sage. Medium body, crisp finish.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a foggy orange-yellow with a finger of white foam. Head retention is fair with a few strands of lacing left behind. Aroma is clean and sharp notes of pine, resin, citrus, and floral hops. Flavor profile is pine, resin, citrus, tropical fruits, and hint of floral on the back. Nice blend of hops, and while they are supported, the malts and underlying base notes are hidden. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a velvety, grainy, and harsh-carbonation texture. Overall, loads of depth as far as hops, but that depth covers up everything else in the mix. It's a clean and pleasantly drinkable double IPA.     Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.

F: Medium body, crisp, tasty as hell and lingering hop oils.    O: Delicious!   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Fairly nice imperial IPA from Founders. Nice golden-amber color, mild head with just a little lingering lacing. Smells of malt, fruity and grassy hops. Tastes of the same hops, mixed with caramel, malt and molasses. Mild mouthfeel, slight bitter aftertaste, decent carbonation and mild taste of alcohol throughout (especially as the beer warmed). A solid beer but a little underwhelming.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 (12 oz bottle, bottled on 05.17.18... poured into a snifter)    L: crystal-clear brassy amber liquid... inch-high stand of loose, frothy foam on the pour, but it somehow collapsed rather fast after a brief hold; a few thin, crusty splashes of lace... jewel-like glow, looks inviting    S: wonderful musky fruitiness - dried orange flesh, hint of fresh apricot, dried citrus peel - nothing unique, but appealingly earthy, leafy, resinous... maybe a soft hint of medicinal alcohol, but not all that boozy    T: bold piney pop, bitter grassy note swells in aftertaste, oily resins and a subtle hint of sweetish candy-like grain linger in aftertaste... pungent, sharp, almost peppery-spicy alcohol flamed by the rip of the hops stings the palate at the start... bit of an almost nutty cookie note from the grain starts emerging after the second sip, builds and washes out after 10 sec... not much depth/layering to flavors, but their intensity is loud    F: alcohol/hop sting leaves a rather potent hum long-lasting past the finish (it's been 2+ min since first sip and it's still buzzing)... despite a touch of resiny stick, overall has a subtly slick, glossy/glassy texture, and with the alcohol feels like it cleans the palate like a medicinal mouthwash, which is great here - really livens the palate    O: pretty straight-forward double IPA, familiar flavors - best things about it being its bright, biting, bitter attack and long, dry, resiny finish... its bitterness and hop-glazed malt coloring begs for another visit   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 The beer is a clear, bright gold color. There is a small white head that disappears quickly, and a little bit of lace.  Fruity aroma, mostly citrus, but also some tropical. Then some pine. There is a sweet malt background.  Grapefruit and grapefruit rind taste. Some mango. Pine late. Caramel.  Nice bitterness.  Just when you think you're getting weary of IPAs, along comes this beer to restore your faith.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Looks honey golden with a white foamy lingering head. Smells like fruit cocktail salad, nice hoppy aroma. Taste has almost a jolly rancher candy flavor.Burst of a sweetness followed by a hop bite then a mild caramel malt finish. Feels well carbonated and not too viscous for a higher ABV brew. I like this beer. A unique hop profile for sure. Overall a solid representation of a double/triple IPA. Overall I would recommend.

Nose: pine, some citrus. Very upfront.     Taste: pine, pineapple, mango, some apple. Really good. Bold bit not overpowering hops with slight bitterness that balances the citrus.

The flavor is rich and bitter, with pineapple, mango, orange, lemon, and grapefruit peel, pink grapefruit flesh, dry pine, sage, juniper, and a huge blast of bitterness. The mouthfeel is rich and full. Overall this is a stellar beer - huge flavor, huge bitterness, and no subtlety, but in the best way. Really wonderful.

Taste follows the nose with awesome pop of citrus hop and Spice with a good backing from The Malt great balance for this big beer. The pine hop is also present that resonates up the nose. Also a floral presents comes in the end. The caramel malt brings the balance. I also catch a slight honey presents. Another great Founders beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Presentation: 12 oz. brown bottle with the "bottled on" date printed on the neck. Served in a Sam Adams pint glass.    Appearance: Clear gold color with a pure white one finger head. Amazing lacing that covers the whole glass.    Smell: The strong, piney, hop aroma is front and center with a hint of grapefruit peel note in the background.    Taste: As expected, a big hop kick throughout with some grapefruit and citrus at the end. The high ABV does not come through in the taste at all.    Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, smooth and creamy with higher than average carbonation.    Overall: There's better DIPAs out there, but not that many. The high ABV does not show at all, so this beer just stands on it's merits: A fantastic hop smell and a big hop kick in the palate. Double trouble indeed.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 The appearance had a somewhat hazy yet clear copper body with a one finger white foamy head that quickly dies. Carbonation is seen rising at a moderate pace. The smell had some pine hops, light mango, some light peppery spice. The taste was bittersweet and peppery with the pine and citrus aspect combined fairly well, dry sweet aftertaste and finish. On the palate, it sat at/about a medium, decent amount of carbonation on this bad boy, ABV not felt so its fairly sessionable. Overall, this is a good DIPA, but still think there’s other DIPA’s out there that I like more.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Another double ipa that looks like an amber ale, dat color and 1/2" white head. Aroma drops substantial grapefruit hoppiness.     Taste is a good dry pale malt bill with boatloads of hops. Hides alcohol well, that good bitterness sting, even though dry, its sticky. The hops run the gamut of tangerine, grapefruit and pine. Minimal caramel, where this one excels over Devil Dancer is the lack of a syrupy, overly thick malt bill creeping into barleywine territory. This cuts that off right up to the line.     Just as good as Hopslam, maybe even better.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Bottle label info: BOTTLED 07/20/15    Slightly hazy, golden body; thick, foamy, sculpted head. Malt sweetness and pine and floral hop nose. Flat, malty sweetness; dull citrus element; prominent hop bitterness grows along with the finish. Medium body; fizzy from carbonation yet relatively full mouthfeel; sticky; mild yet dense sweetness.    I had this one past its prime yet its still a solid DIPA. I picked this up in Ohio back in mid-October of 2015. Still, in 2016, it looks good and has remnants of solid hop base, flavor and aroma-wise. There's very little hint at the high ABV. Its characteristics still emphasize malts and hops. My next trip back east of the Mississippi River will have me looking for a fresher version and a new look at my review scores. Even "old", this is an awesome DIPA...

Smell- Lots of tropical fruit, pineapple, mango, citrus zest. Hoppy herbal aroma that is dank. A fun sniffer.  Taste- Very hop forward and juicy at the same time. Complex. Bitter passion fruit and grapefruit zest. Piny hops flavoring.The hops bittering is medium to high and semi-intense. Malt backbone; burnt caramel malt. Alcohol warming. Bittersweet dry finish.   Feel-Heavy side of medium body; neither a chugger nor a sipper. Soft but prickly and tight carbonation. Feels boozy and syrupy at times, but settles as the drink warms and the carbonation loosens up.  Overall-Definetely a big drinker and complex IPA. A good brew that satisfies both the need for a hops fix and for something juicy.

Smells like caramel, honey, bread, tropical fruit, light citrus, and grassy pine hops. Tastes sweet and caramely, with tropical fruit notes, mild honey, light bread, citrus, and a bitter and piney hop presence. Feels light-medium bodied, creamy with mild carbonation. Overall a balanced and really well made Imperial IPA.

S: Pungent hops on the nose... evergreens and citrus mixed with a hint of thyme.    T/F: Bready and malty up front giving way to a nice hop bitterness. Spruce and pine dominate with notes of grapefruit/citrus. Effervescent and slightly sticky on the mouthfeel.    O: A delicious double IPA, and just about what you'd expect from Founders. Outstanding beer!

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass    A - Beer pours a 2 finger off white, somewhat orangish head that is frothy with a slight creaminess. The head dissipates fairly quickly. Beer itself is copper in color with a bit of orange with quite a bit of carbonation. Carbonation rises very quickly to the top. 4/5    S - Grapefruit and pine kick things off right away for me in the aroma. I also get light stone fruits such as peaches and pears as well as a little bit of orange peel. There is a light malty undertone but the hops cover this up quite easily. An ever so slight spiciness is present too. 4/5    T - Surprisingly orange juice and pear are the first notes that I get but this is quickly replaced by grapefruit and orange peel. There is a bit of pine here as well but the citrus really takes over. There is more pine on the back end, mainly upon swallowing but even there the flavor is dominated by bitter citrus rind. Malt is light and slightly caramel sweet throughout but it is somewhat hard to discern due to the amount of hops. Long bitter finish stays with you for quite a while after swallowing. 4.25/5     M - Carbonation burn is not as pronounced as expected based on the appearance. Carb burn is present but it is only light to moderate in strength. Beer is slightly drying on the back end but not as drying as expected. Medium bodied beer. 4/5    O - This beer features a nice combination of hop flavors that make for an interesting imperial IPA experience. Very bitter, as expected, and also quite warming in the stomach due to the high abv. Malt is fairly well hidden but it can be tasted. 4/5

Was really excited to see this come in and equally as disappointed to see the 4 cases we got are 5 months old. IMO, if they going to sell it that old it is fair to review it for what it is.  LOOKS: Orange-amber, aggressive pour into snifter with one finger of off white soapy head. Small bubbles.  AROMA: Floral, citrus, honey, mildly astringent quality. Some tropical and stone fruit qualities.  TASTE: Very mellow. No big hop punch which might be expected considering age. Sweet honey, mild citrus, mild bitterness more in back of sip. Some mild alcohol.   MOUTHFEEL: Creamy, low carbonation.  About what I expected, can't try a fresh one if they send old product. Of course the store should have asked for fresher product.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Cloudy golden appearance, with a small but bubbly head. The hazy nature of this beer makes it look very natural, almost like it just poured out from a gourge in the earth.    Smells of bitter malts, raisins, licorice and general funkiness.     Taste is surprisingly subtle, in a most delightful way. The bitterness from the hops is apparent, yet never overwhelming. A lot of pine and citrus. I am not sure what I was expecting going into this, but definitely not this. Incredibly drinkable, and quite shallow substance-wise. Fine, not great. Probably overpriced at $12 for a 4-pack, but respectable.

Pine, dankness, grapefruit pith, big astringent hop florelness, and a bit of a honey sweetness.    I will admit this beer is out of its prime, but I'm just not in love with this beer, regardless. Beginning of the sip starts with a rather big malt sweetness, some grapefruit, and big resinous pine. This has a very minimal underlying note of peach and orange juice. One would think the sweetness would continue throughout the sip, but it randomly pivots to a rather dry finish. The final taste is of the thick, palate-coating hop bitterness that lingers for minutes after the sip and a slight alcohol heat.    I just don't find the beer balanced. I probably wouldn't get it again. I could see it pairing well with a pineapple upside down cake. It gets a 84.5/100.

Moderate lacing and spotting. Smell is somewhat boozy with tangerine and orange. Taste follows suit with a rind grapefruit and somewhat dry finish. Very smooth for a 9.4abv! One of my first doubles that I fell in love with. Can't go wrong with this if you like ipas and dipas. Cheers!

Poured into a Sammy perfect pint glass. It's slightly hazy, with a medium golden color. Has sparse, scattered carbo and a bit of white foam clinging to the edges. Not much lacing present, either. Nose is all hops, with a mix of sweetish apricot and bitter grapefruit. A fairly smooth feel combines with a medium body; no complaints.     Taste has a hint of toasty malt with some apricot and tangerine at the outset. It then leans a bit to the bitter side, with some pithy, rindy citrus hitting the palate. Though not knocking me off my chair (I'll leave that to Alewife! ), this is a tasty DIPA. Prosit!!    4.1/5 rDev -2.1%  look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4    1752

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Bottled on 06/15/2015. It was poured into a snifter at 50F.     It's light orange in color with a cream colored and creamy textured head about two fingers tall. The head lingers down to a film within around 5 minutes, leaving a few light flecks of lacing.     Upon swirling my glass, an aroma of floral and citrus hops dominate the show with a subdued sweet malt backbone lurking in the background.     It's full bodied and creamy with a resinous and oily texture. As it warms the presence of ethanol definitely becomes apparent, but that is to be expected of a beer with 9.4% ABV. It really feels like it's much greater than 86 IBUs, which is great for a hop head like myself and also fitting for this particular style.     The first tasting notes are pine, orange, and lemon. As it warms, the hops are countered by an emerging rich butterscotch malt presence.    The beer has a great, punchy hop character when closer to fridge temperature, but I think it really shines after the malt presence shows up fashionably late at around 55-60F. In my opinion, this is an extremely well made DIPA, and I would recommend it to any hop head beer connoisseur.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 This is a nice-looking beer: a thick (albeit brief-lived) rocky, slightly-off-white head that leaves nice rafts of lacing atop a crystal-clear, sparkling gold body. Aromawise it presents as a strong, mouth-watering blend of citrus, pineapple, and dank, dark pine, against a less-apparent background of spicy florals with faint alcohol and caramel undertones. Up front, the palate is sweet pineapple and bitter pine; the bitterness picks up mid-palate with some caramel undertones. Alcohol notes are quite apparent at the end. The finish is slightly bitter, followed by an as-expected clinging bitterness that sets in and lingers, with hints of pine and citrus, for quite awhile. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and creamy, warming from the alcohol and prickly due to some very assertive carbonation. Double Trouble is really well-balanced, with just a slight bit of sweetness making it past the hop bitterness. (12 oz bottle, 85 days after pkg.)

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Appearance - golden with a 2 finger white head; light to no lacing    Smell - light aroma, not much here that impresses    Taste - very smooth, decent chew but good hop flavor    Feel - medium body; average chew for a double ipa    Overall: would fall well behind my favorite IPAs; good but not memorable.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured from bottle to tulip glass.

Taste follows, not too cloying, tropical fruits and mandarin oranges, just a touch of bitterness and pine. Smooth, creamy feel. Freakin fantastic.

Ends with a sweet finish.  M: medium. sweet aftertaste.  O: Nice balanced DIPA. A slightly greater hop bite would have set this over the top. Maybe I had an old bottle.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Bottled 2 months ago.    A - Golden tan  S - sweet bread, definitely getting more malt coming through than anticipated. Maybe a hint of pineapple...  T - minimal hop up front, but really comes through in the middle. More balance as I drink this with minimal grain coming through. Definitely getting the alcohol taste in the back complementing the bitterness...  M - astringent, yes  O - Maybe its the bottle date, but I'm not getting nearly the amount of pine and citrus as others report. With all the complexities that go into it, nothing in this beer that blows me away. While its pretty bitter, can definitely tell the IBUs are not maxed out. I'd like to try to find this one fresh on draft somewhere just to see if it is this batch, but hey i'm just happy I found it in my area.

Cant say that I was overly impressed with this one. I was expecting more to be honest. Definitely doesn't fit in my top DIPA category.

The taste follows with orange and grapefruit with a nice malt balance and no indication of the abv.    The mouthfeel is slightly slick with medium carbonation.    Overall this is outstanding. Easy to drink, no hint of the abv, great balance. I may be too low at 4.25. I can see why Doom is so good.

Not getting the mango and passion fruit I was getting from the smell.   M - light - medium mouthfeel. Distinctly bitter. Alc reasonably well covered. Aftertaste is grapefruit, very bitter.

Finally had the KBS at the Untapped festival and...damn.    I don't know if I could tell this and Double Jack (Firestone) apart in a taste test, one of my fave DIPAs. Along with the label that I can't keep staring at, the aroma is unforgettable. If you happen to do woodwork and have cut into a wet piece of alligator juniper, this is close. I tried the single and will be back for the 4-pack.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Picked up a very fresh four-pack at my local Trig's grocer (bottled three weeks ago). Poured at about 50 degrees into a pint glass.    L: Pours a bright honey amber with about three-quarters-of-an-inch of eggshell head that dissipates fairly quickly to a thin film and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Crystal-clear, with moderate visible carbonation.    S: Bright citrus and more subtle pine hop notes in the nose; the most prominent to come through are grapefruit and orange. There are some bready/cracker malts underneath, along with a bit of earthiness. Nice, juicy bouquet.    T: Smooth and sweet bready and caramel malts at the outset, with the citrus and resinous hop flavors following right behind--more of the grapefruit than the orange, as far as the fruit notes are concerned. As the flavor moves into the middle, there's definitely a presence of some clear alcohol poking through, but this doesn't detract from the taste as it mingles quite nicely with the hops. The back end is surprisingly sweet--likely from the caramel malts--which is also helpful in keeping down that taste of clear alcohol. There's a bit of tartness at the back end, followed by a lingering resinous/citrus rind hop bitterness.    F: Really nice body on this beer: It's firmly medium-bodied and displays, in turns, smoothness, creaminess, tartness, and bitterness. Great level of carbonation on this one. Though the hop bitter lingers, this one is far from syrupy on the palate.    O: This is a stellar DIPA from Founders. It features some great hop notes, a nice malt profile, and just enough complexity to really accentuate these features. If anything, I wish it brought more of that fresh, juicy hop flavor. But there's little to complain about with a beer this tasty.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This is a big DIPA there's no doubt about it. Lots of booze, lots of hops, pretty substantial malt backbone to back it up. Has a west coast vibe to it, I'm actually a little surprised to see this coming out of Founders, I guess between their standard IPAs and dark beers this caught me a little off guard.     Pours a mostly clear gold in color, like a darker lager. Head is in the two finger category and laces minimally at least in the glass I was served this in. The cap can be easily resuscitated with a few swirls.     Citrus on the nose, a combination of pineapple and orange mostly with perhaps a melon quality as well. Got a lot of grapefruit in the flavor, more peel than pulp. Fairly sweet in the mid palate but the hops crush that after the swallow. Blissfully carbonated to lighten up the mouthfeel. Letting this warm up slightly and agitating to recreate head improves the drinking experience.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12 oz. bottle into a tulip. Clear golden in color with some cloudiness. Low carbonation. An aggressive pour yielded a 3 finger head of sticky, white foam. Doesn't have a strong aroma, but I get dank pine, citrus, tropical fruit, and a hint of toasty malt. Medium weight, and smooth enough on the mouthfeel. Initially, there's a boozy sweetness with tropical fruit in the background. Hoppy bitterness and pine resin set in middleways and remain until the aftertaste.     Good balance between alcohol and flavor. It's there but it's not overpowering. Decent taste, but a little sweet for my liking. Overall, not bad but not one of my favorites from Founders.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Look - Very light orange body. Little lacing. Thinner than average white head.    Smell - Malt but when swirled Pineapple and grapefruit. I'm glad to see citrus come through on this imperial.    Taste - Smell translates to taste. Stronger citrus flavor than DD.    Feel - Not a carb bomb. Heavy. Alcohol doesn't stick to tongue.    Overall - Better than devil dancer. I like the characteristics of a lighter beer with this heavy.

Look = 4.0 Pours a hazy, bright golden color with just a ring of white head that quickly fades to a ring. Good, uniform lace with small bubbles and sticky.  Aroma = 5.0 Hops everywhere. Citrus and piney hops aroma. Not really getting any balance from it but there is a hint of alcohol. The best part is that the aroma doesn’t fade at all. It sticks around and is always present.  Taste = 4.0 Citrus and piney hops dominate. Piney bitterness builds towards the end and leaves a significant bite that lingers well into the after taste. Not balanced, but it doesn’t have to be.  Feel = 4.0 Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Fresh and crisp fits the flavor well.  Drinkability = 4.0 Comes in at a well hidden 9.4% ABV and 86 IBUs, each of which hurst the drinkability somewhat.  Overall = 4.25 Overall just an incredible DIPA. Really solid across the board but the over the top aroma really stands out. Can’t go wrong with this one.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Deep golden, semi transparent pour with a large soapy white head that has great retention. A little lacing works its way back into the beer.     Smells like ripe citrus, some caramel malts, and pine.     Fairly unique flavor. Some sort of melon is dominating. Also pine, orange. Just when it starts to assert its bitterness, the semi sweet malts come in and calm it down. It is a bit boozy on the back end. Flavors are all balanced nicely.     Quite an astringent feel. Very drying. Some slickness from resin.     There are several 9-10% ipas that incorporate the alcohol much better, but overall it is a very good beer.

F- Juicy grapefruit, citrus peel, a nice caramel malt backbone that balances out the grapefruit. For the most part, this is a very tasty grapefruit-forward IPA.    M- Medium bodied, nice carbonation. Bitter zest but not too bitter. Reasonably drinkable.    O- This is a very tasty IPA on tap. Plenty of grapefruit to satisfy the die-hard west coast IPA fans.

The fine malt character becomes evident first, caramel notes and a sweetness. A wonderfully brilliant citrus taste lights up the taste buds. For an 86 IBU beer, it maintains a wonderful taste profile that's eminently citrusy and somewhat piney but it's not over the top bitter.    M-Mildly carbonated and with a feel that's not too bright or hot.     O-The magnificent intensity of the hops delivers such an excellent tasting beer. However, while the hop intensity is something you'd expect from an Imperial IPA, it does not lose its balance.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12 oz bottle, 2013 edition, poured into a pint glass    Appearance: Pours a very pretty, cloudy, deep amber/orangeish color with a quarter of a finger of white-colored head that quickly dissolved away into a thin lacing of foam that completely covered the top of the beer.    Aroma: Very nice aromas of toasted malt, which imparted notes of French baguettes, English muffins and whole wheat crackers, followed by lots of orange-like citrus, honey and caramel, and lots of floral, aromas of honeysuckle, clover, wildflowers and piney, grassy, hops.    Taste: Delicious, actually! There’s a ton of bready, toasted malt up front, followed by lots of caramel and brown sugar-like sweetness, finished by lots of piney, slightly bitter hops. Being a bottle that has a year’s aging on it, I can only assume that the hops has mellowed some, especially, since this is a double IPA, with IBUs of 86, and I actually find it to be really well balanced, with the hoppy bitterness really well muted.     Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied to slightly chewy and slighty carbonated. With an ABV of 9.4%, I’m surprised at how little alcohol there is on the palate, like none! The alcohol is really well masked, which can make this beer very dangerous as you want to drink more than one or two in a sitting…you could easily end up falling on your ass!    Overall: Wow! Being a double IPA, and being that I overall really don’t like IPAs much less double IPAs, this is a hell of a lot better than I thought it would be! I’m amazed at how much I like it actually! It has to be because this bottle has a year’s age on it, which must have really toned down the hops. It actually tastes much more like an American barleywine rather than a double IPA. It’s fucking delicious!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Look: It is nice light colored DIPA. Poured it a little too cold. The head was smallish (perhaps due to temperature) and went away quickly. I kind of hate the look section of reviewing. As long as its not flat, has weird chunks it shouldn't, or an odd color, it doesn't impact my rating much. 4.5 for the short-lasting head.    Smell: I poured it too cold so I had to wait before I could give it a proper review. Even warmed up over 10 minutes it still doesn't have strong hop smell I would expect. Pine hops with a lot of light malty sweetness. And I mean a lot of malty sweetness.    Taste: Tastes like a solid DIPA. Mostly piney hops with a touch citrus/floral hops. That sweetness is a nice compliment. Personally I much prefer the in your face hops flavor like with Myrcennary or Hop Stoopid when I have a big, boozy beer like this.    Feel: A little hot, but deceiving for 9.4% ABV. Goes down smooth. Thought it might be sticky, but it wasn't.    Overall: For somebody who likes IPAs, but not insane IPAs, this would be a good intro to the double IPA. It is accessible. It is a solid IPA that I would recommend any hop-head, like myself, to try.

Instead of centennials bright reddish amber, double trouble is a more subtle hazy orangeish straw color with a subdued head. Smell is mild but good, sweet pineapple, mild hoppy punch, bready malts, hint of vanilla. Taste is much smoother and maltier than I was expecting very creamy. Ruby red grapefruit. Fresh bright hops finish it off. Feel is slick and creamy, I bet this would be amazing on nitro. Mild carbonation. Overall, I really enjoyed it. Very malty, delicious hops.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 355ml bottle from Beers of Europe (£3.79):  This one was a very strong and incredibly bitter double IPA, one that I was expecting to be as such but I still ended up surprised by the strength of it, it was absolutely loaded with hops. A very in your face beer and one that had to be sipped away at slowly rather than quaffed, perhaps the only thing that prevented me from rating it that little bit higher.

look: 1.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 A - The appearance is not too pleasing which is a shame because this is an awesome beer. Pours a finger of off white head with a yellow gold colored beer. Just to LOOK at it you'd think it was a regular domestic brew.   S - Sweet oranges, grapefruit, lots of hops, an earthy herbal note, apples and a slight caramel in the back.   T - Sweet orange and grapefruit flesh followed by extremely crisp and bitter hops. The bitterness lingers for quite some time. Definitely more a bitter IPA than a sweet one to be sure.   O - A damned fine IPA, makes it onto my top the IPAs list definitely. Not for those new to IPAs though.   V - Four pack of bottles, medium/high value.   
look: 3 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3.25 Pours a hazy honey color, with hardly any head. Aroma is restrained hops. Taste is malty, boozy and balanced by hops. Mouthfeel feel oily for an ipa, but not bad. Overall and balanced dipa with a kick of booze.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 12oz bottle (great artwork on the label) poured into a snifter (unfortunately, not fresh--a few months past its prime); golden to tan in color; very little head and not much lacing; citric aroma but not strong; fairly smooth--not much carbonation; a citric, bitter hoppiness flavor but malt backbone comes through a bit in the end. Overall: A really enjoyable DIPA, which I regret not trying when it was fresher. Hop profile not as complex, interesting or unique as many other DIPAs but solid overall beer that beats many in its category. (9.0)

Not sure how I feel about that  T--For a 9% the booze is not overwhelming as it warms you up as you go. Nice bitter hops as expected followed by sweet malt, then finishing bitter hops  M--Good carbonation, medium for the body  O--Very nice IIPA for sure. Loved the hops citrusy smells with crushed pine needles. I prefer my IPAs to have a little dank/resin scent so I was missing that here, but overall this is a great IIPA that I would definitely have again. Definitely could see this one sneaking up on you after a few

This beer is so f'ing good man. Great bitter, light flavor. Good aftertaste, strong because it's a double. I love this brew and buy it whenever I see it. (Which is rare)   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Hoppy taste and aroma, though not overly citrusy. Medium malt taste and body. Finishes somewhat bitter. Better IMO than Surly abrasive, still liked dreadnaught more.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Poure from a 12 oz. bottle  A - looks like a pilsner but for the slight haze, retains and extremely sparse head  S - a good blend with light citrus hints, but I get that from most IPAs  T - pretty good for a DIPA (see my disclaimer below); the aftertase is lasting and is bitter,but wihtout an unpleasant bite  F - pretty smooth  O - As far as IPAs/DIPAs go, this one is fairly good, and it went well with lunch and my grilled reuben.    Disclaimer: I am generally not an IPA fan and don't typically order them when out; that said, I keep trying them out of curiosity and try to avoid my preferences when evaluating

A: pours bronze like orange with minimal white foam which resolved to a steady trace along the edge of the glaze  S: A hoppy bouquet of citrus (lemon>orange), zest, pineapple and a medley of tropical fruits, hint of malt  T: A lot of citrus up front, grapefruit, lemon zest, hint of pine before malt softens the bitterness with only a mild aftertaste of grapefruit  Mouth: Carbonation lightens the body so its not too syrupy, good palate cleansing acidity and pushes the floral/fruit notes forward. Alcohol notes barely noticed beneath the complexity of the flavors  Overall: My tastes tend to favor maltier, darker beers – but I have to admit this is one of the finest American Style Double/Imperial IPA. Great beer at a reasonable price point.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12oz Bottle from Bottle Caps in Watertown NY for $5    Appearance - Gold colour with a large size white coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation showing and there is some great lacing. The head lasted for around 4-5 minutes before it was gone.    Smell - Hops, apricots, grapefruit, malts    Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste apricot, grapefruit, and malts. There is also some apricots, hops and a grassy herbal flavour.    Overall - Lots of hop bitterness and the booze is really well hidden. Tastes a lot like a hopped up version of their Centennial IPA. An above average DIPA.

I poured this into a Belgian ale glass because I can really appreciate the aroma.    A - a mildly cloudy, copper color with medium head (about a half inch thick).    S - big grapefruit aroma with a clove/pine earthiness.    T - The "double" factor is definitely evident in this one (i.e. don't chug). The warmth of alcohol is mellowed by sweetness and quickly followed by bitter pine. Minimal aftertaste.    M - medium body.     Overall - This is a great example of the style. I haven't found anyone who doesn't appreciate this Double. Thanks Founders!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Appearance – Pours a clear orange amber color with a very nice head and light spotted lacing.    Smell – Smell is great! One of the better IPA nose I’ve experienced thus far. A sweet citrus – lemon/grapefruit hops smell with no bitterness. Some malt is there too. Very good!    Taste – Malt, grapefruit, a touch of pine, with a hoppy bitterness.    Mouthfeel – Crisp, dry, medium carbonation. The 9.4%abv is well hidden. Leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste.     Drinkability – Not overly hoppy. Smells great, tastes real good. My only small complaint is a lingering bitter aftertaste.

What we have here is a delicious, boozy Double IPA in a bottle that will give me nightmares for the next week. I fell asleep after a four pack with my iPod on shuffle. . .I emailed my music video treatment to Rammstein the next day. Seriously Founders, how about some bottle art that doesn't inspire night terrors?

A- Nice fruity aroma from the hops, mango/grapefruit. Just maybe a hint from the aroma that it is a higher ABV. Nice caramel malt aroma as well.    A- Clear copper/gold, thin white head that dissipated pretty quickly. Carbonation rising through the middle of the glass.    F- Definite carbonation hit to the roof of the mouth. Spicy off the bat, and through the finish! Heat after the swallow I would guess from the alcohol. Almost of little bit of pepper type bite through the finish.    M- Higher carbonation level than I would have thought and the elevated alcohol level is definitely apparent with the warmth/burn. Coats the mouth thoroughly, yet dry finish.    O- Generally like the big DIPAs to be a little smoother, though this one actually is quite refreshing. Aftertaste left me a bit off.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Notes from phone. 12 oz. bottle dated June 13th 2014, tasted September 1st, 2014. Pours a surprisingly light gold with a slight touch of amber. Solid finger of off-white head which stays for about a minute or so. Not quite hazy, but a bit of extremely fine pieces of sediment spread throughout the beer when held to the light. Sticky but thin lacing.    Aroma is massively hoppy, as to be expected. Tropical and citrus fruits mingle beautifully with a piney, resiny, and slightly floral bouquet of hops. Grapefruit and pineapple with a touch of lemony zing. Fresh-cut grass. Slightly bready with a touch of DMS indicating some pilsner malts, which would explain the surprisingly pale color. Hint of straw. Slightly spicy phenols.    Flavor follows the nose, with the grassy and piney bitterness making gains and matching the juicy and fruity flavors. Surprisingly balanced for the style and the light malt base initially threw me off a little. Alcoholic sweetness that isn't too much combines with a slightly sweet but subtle malt base. Hops are still kicking with a just-bitter-enough finish.     Medium bodied and reasonably carbonated. This doesn't taste and especially doesn't feel like a 9.4% beast, but it is. Warm but crisp. The bitter finish is dry but doesn't cross the line into astringency.    Stylistically, I'm not sure this is a perfect DIPA. With that said, this is a phenomenally tasty beer. Extremely well-balanced in every way and a few surprises thrown in. Another winner from Founder's.

Reddish-orange with a quickly thinning tan head. Smells herbal and oily with faint fruits. Has a precise, floral bitterness on the palate that ends with a splash of orange, a hint of spice and consistent all the way through. Medium with enough heat to keep you warm. A potent yet refined, classic DIPA.

Very hoppy - just how I like my IPA's. For some, the bitterness could be a bit overwhelming, but I find it very enjoyable. The pine & citrus basically punched me in the face upon the first taste. There's a slight bit of malt, once you get past the hops. Gotta love the higher alcohol content too.

look: 3.25 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Poured into a tulip glass.41 degrees.    Look - Very carbonated pours a hazy orange color- similar to a blue moon.Very bubbly 2 inch head that is quickly leaving. Some spotty lacing left behind..not much though.    Smells like a typical IPA - notes of grapefruit coming through with some minor fruit. I can definitely notice some simcoe. As it warms about halfway through your glass you will notice some sweet carmel maltiness coming through.    Tastes like a very good double. All the notes in the head come through in the taste. pretty well balanced. I can taste a very minor hint of alcohol, reminding me that I'm drinking a 9.4. some malt balances out the strong bitterness from the hops...but still hoppy enough to make the hophead very happy with this brew.Definitely a sipper.    Has a nice creamy like mouth feel to it...semi heavy DIPA. Well carbonated as well.     Overall this is a solid beer. Liked this a lot more then Founders Devil Dancer TIPA....that was just too boozy for me(as are most triples in my opinion)...this beer is pretty well balanced...lots of hop bitterness, some malts push through to calm them slightly......I have had tons of DIPAS and by no means would i give this beer a 94 rating on here and i wouldn't go out and BUY this again, BUT..... if somebody offered me one i would not turn it down. in a nutshell, glad i picked it up and tried it out and if you haven't, give it a go.
