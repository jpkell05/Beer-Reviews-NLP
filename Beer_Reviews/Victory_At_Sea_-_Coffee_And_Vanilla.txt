S - Hints of bitter coffee and roasted malt along with dark chocolate on the nose along with sweet vanilla and lingering caramel notes   T - Follows the nose with a really nice amount of bitter, roasted coffee up front along with roasted/toasted malts followed by bitter dark chocolate balanced by notes of sweet vanilla and caramel   F - Medium bodied leaning on fuller bodied with a light to moderate amount of carbonation - smooth, rich, creamy   O - An incredible porter that really hits all the right notes - powerful flavors, a great feel, and a fantastic smell

The vanilla sweetness permeates through. Slightly toasted. Smells incredible    T: Dark and rich. The dark chocolate and coffee work in tandem with the heavy toasted flavors. Just as that wanes, a creamy milky sensation takes over and the vanilla drops in.     O: This is a decadent dessert beer. Like a bitter chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream, and black coffee blended up into a beer. Fantastic.

The color is a deep brown color, with a nice light brown head. This brew has the look of coffee,and not saying that is a bad thing. Nice amount of lacing to this this Porter, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with roasted grains and malts, mixed with coffee an sweetness. The roasted smells are definitely high an in the smell of this brew. So far Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Rich an Bold with flavors. You first pick up on a Sweet, Roasted grains, malts and coffee. A smooth easy going finish. It is really hard to pick up on the 10.00% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth an rich. The vanilla flovor is a nice touch this brew. This is one of the better coffee Porters on the market.   The body of Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla is a medium to heavy, but not to heavy. This is a well put together coffee Porter. If you are a fan of coffee or Porters, you should look this on up. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Roasted, Sweet, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla a 4.75 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Ballast Point Brewing Company, did a super nice job with this American Imperial Porter.

Taste follows, dominated by chocolate! There's dark chocolate in the taste but milk chocolate in the feel. Slight hoppiness but it's well balanced, and if it didnt have that, it would be too rich.  Feel is silky smooth, very round and lingering but not too rich. Alcohol is well hidden.  Overall a great chocolately porter, a nice replacement for desert!

Dessert nose that gives way to some pretty astringent things in the taste which lay awkwardly next to a full body + considerable residual sweetness. There's a chocolate thing not happening, which is maybe how it's a porter not a stout, but it's doing it no favours. Every time I want to love this, I'm getting the bottom of a pot of Maxwell House. I'm drinking it at room temp, not cellar temp, but either way, there's some buzz I'm just not catching.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 I’m astonished at the balance and nuanced effort taken to perfect this lovely porter. It hits on all cylinders and the only reason it’s not rated a fiver is , in my opinion, it could be a bit dryer. While not syrupy, there is just a tad more residual sugar for my palate. That being said, in a word, outstanding!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Aroma is sweet vanilla, coffee and dark malts. The flavor is coffee, dark malts, vanilla, chocolate and a mix of mild sweetness, slight chilies/spices and acidity in the finish.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Have been chasing this one for a while. Nice jet black body and fudge colored head. Nose is sweet coffee and vanilla with hops in the background.     Flavor is complex with different stages, all of them balanced and delicious. The coffee and roasted malt tones are intense and really well mixed with solid citrus and pine hop sorties. The vanilla kind of ties the whole thing together. As superb as its reputation. Worth seeking out.

Taste - It starts with a STRONG coffee taste that winds down into notes of dark chocolate and vanilla.    Mouthfeel - Its a medium to heavy beer with light carbonation, that finishes into a pleasant bitterness with a slight alcohol burn.    Overall - This is a great heavy beer that is perfect for sipping, not knocking back as a cold one with the boys.

Soft, velvety mouthfeel despite being a medium to full bodied beer. Chocolate aftertaste and a bit of a booze burn too.     Really nice imperial porter although I expected more regarding the hype around it.

Smooth clean finish with a slightly creamy mouthfeel and a good amount of carbonation throughout. The high ABV is well hidden and only slightly detectable towards the end of the beer. A great offering and I look forword to sampling their other similar products.

Strong coffee, vanilla and chocolate. Is this a dessert? Hopefully, this tastes as good as it smells...Mother of God, the taste does not disappoint! Sweetness up front, then the coffee kicks in. Strong alcohol aftertaste but not overpowering. This is the stuff that dreams are made of. Mouthfeel is about perfect - not too flat or carbonated. A bit syrupy but not too much. Good balance. You can tell this is gonna be a filling beer- a meal in a bottle so to speak. Too bad it's so damned heavy. My mouth tells me I could drink these all night, but my belly is full. A great special occasion beer but due to the price, not one I will be having often. I love Ballast Point, and this could very well be the best beer they make. Thankful I had the chance to try this one!

Recently tried the amazing BA version and realized I had yet to review the original. So here it is:    L: Poured into a goblet, it produces about one finger of frothy brown-sugar head, like that on a mocha latte. Body as dark as any I've seen, retention is excellent, but not a ton of lacing.    S: Just amazing. Like a Tiramisu cake in a bottle. The pour produces immediate and luxurious quantities of vanilla, followed by turbinado cane sugar, fudge, coconut, bourbon, chocolate syrup, then blonde roast coffee.    T: The only difference in the flavor is that the coffee is more pronounced, providing a foundation and skeleton for the sweet chocolate and bourbon notes that compose the body. Boozy.    F: Syrupy, but finishes very dry. Not too sticky.    O: A perfect model of a sweet imperial porter. Makes one hell of a base beer for barrel aging too.

Not too thin either though.  Overall a very enjoyable beer. This is becoming a favorite of mine due to the quality, value and availability.

It's an imperial porter, but those coffee & vanilla adjuncts are going to fade over time. A porter that has adjuncts in it should definitely have a date on their. Wonderful tasting coffee with a tad bit of sweetness from the vanilla. That 10% abv is not traceable. This is at least a 95 in my opinion which is in World Class territory. Oh well, maybe I am just a sucker for these dark ales that have coffee & vanilla added to them. Cheers! A

Smells sweet of vanilla and chocolate with a hint of coffee. The chocolate and vanilla hit me right away with the bitterness of coffee coming later and followed by the warm alcohol heat on the breath. Lingering are faint hints of the bourbon & rye whisky from the barrel aging making it a fun complex drink Feels full bodied coating the mouth nicely. Overall this comes across to me as a high quality product and very enjoyable to sip on a cool winters day. If you're a fan of the dark brews you're sure to enjoy this

A little bitterness at the end.    O: Most vanilla porters are too sweet and unbalanced for me. This one is an exception.

Surprisingly not a very viscous body at all - I guess that's the gravity difference of an imperial porter from an imperial stout. Light tan frothy head with some larger soapy bubbles throughout, fizzes down to a thin layer of some larger bubbles. Smells of fairly intense coffee beans, a good heap of vanilla, and touches of toffee. Almost gives off a vanilla coke kind of aroma. Tastes of fairly bitter coffee beans followed by a light touch of raisin bread, vanilla extract, caramel and some toffee. Heat and bitterness is definitely evident in this brew. Mouthfeel is rather thin but medium to medium-high carbonation keeps it pleasant. Victory st Sea doesn't quite pack the flavor punch I was expecting but I'm still a fan of this brew and I'd say its true to style, even in its imperialized form.

S: Light barrel aroma, , vanilla and coffee are more pronounced.  T: Coffee, vanilla, raisin and a hint of molasses and toffee. Moderate alcohol burn.  O: Much thinner than expected, moderate carbonation. I'll let the others collect dust for awhile.

My westie cousin, Colby Chandler, is now VP of BP, having started out as the manager of the original Homebrew Mart. I was privileged enough to taste Sculpin in Beta in early-2002, one of the last times that I saw his dad, my Uncle Rick, alive. 8=( My Pops had passed the previous summer & both of them were terribly long-lived, which may not bode well for my longevity. C'est la vie.     From the bottle: "Dedicated to the Craft".     I Pop!ped the cap & went with a (slightly) uncharacteristic aggro pour. My specious reasoning was that it being a dark beer, I might get to see a pseudo-cascade as a result. I am happy to report that my efforts were highly successful! Not only that, but it puffed up with just under three fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-tan/light-brown head with good retention that left behind some nice lacing. Nose was redolent with coffee! Mmm. I love coffee, especially in the morning since old habits die hard as a retired U.S. Navy sailor. Color was Very Dark Brown to Black/Opaque (SRM = > 34, < 44) with mahogany highlights. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but big for an American Porter, certainly. This base version had a solid roastiness, definitely coffee, some smoke & even some chocolate, but I was not getting the vanilla. The vanilla became assertive on the finish, lending the beer a sweetness that it did not initially have. Finish was dry, more roasty than the sweetness could overcome, but it was fine by me. This is the base beer for many variants, so I would encourage you to have this one first & then try some of the others.

Very defined, sweet vanilla aroma with coffee in a background role. Some caramel malt notes as well to round things out. Although the vanilla smells more like a flavoring additive than an actual vanilla beans addition to the brewing process, the aroma is still very enjoyable overall.    Taste has much more of the coffee flavor, very dark roasted, vanilla plays the complementary role here.    Feel is medium, body is a bit thin, good carbonation, and some pretty solid & stiff bitterness.    Overall, a nice vanilla-forward porter at an absolutely terrific value. Definitely start it at 50°+ and let it warm.

There is some sweetness but it is subdued by the roasty bitterness that persists right through the finish. Medium bodied with a soft creamy feel it goes down with a bit of warmth.    If you like roasty bitterness this is for you.

The aromas of coffee and vanilla are very forward and apparent, but they aren't alone. Smoke, hops, and dark chocolate are there too. The flavor is skewed sweet, but still complex and outstanding. Coffee, vanilla, char, chocolate, hops, and some well-hidden boozy warmth all play on the tongue quite well. The carbonation is good and helps keep this from getting sticky.     One of the best "vanilla" forward brews I've had.

Retention and lacing are above average. The aroma is vanilla prominent with coffee in the background. The taste is vanilla forward with the coffee again in the background. There is also a sweet chocolate undertone. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated and undry (not in an unpleasant way). Overall, very good. I don't know that I've ever had this beer this fresh with the vanilla so dominant. I have 5 more from the pack and may revisit this review.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 From a growler via Jungle Jim's Eastgate in a snifter. This mighty fine "porter"  (pert near a stout) pours a rich muddy blackish brown with a fantastic head of  light tan foam that has excellent staying power that finally fades to a thick layer  with exceptional lacing. Nose of rich coffee, cocoa, vanilla, spicy hops, char,  and earthy malts. Flavors hit the perfect note with vanilla bean dancing about a  moderately heavy char flavor on bakers cocoa and caramel malts that drift on  waves of vanilla and rich coffee with a spicy pine tinged hop finish. Very nice   mouth feel; medium light carbonation that is lively for the style, full body,   coating, and finishing with a char laden finish.     A stout lovers porter for certain, this one is sure to please those who like their   porters on the Baltic side of life with nicely hidden alcohol. Excellent. One of the   best I have ever had from Ballast Point.    Cheers

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Deep black color with a thin thick caramel head with short retention.  Aroma with the expected predominant notes of cold brew coffee and vanilla beans. Hints of caramel, cocoa, mild lactic acid, a bit of caramel, nuts and dark fruits.  Flavor with notes of vanilla upfront, caramel, green coffee beans, some spices, lactic acid, roasted malts (even though the sensation comes more from coffee), licorice, piney and floral hops, dark chocolate and cream. Dry and bitter aftertaste with a lingering roasted note with pine and vanilla in the background.  Bordering full body with appropriate carbonation. Alcohol of 10% abv is very well hidden.  At a first sip, I noticed it was going to be relatively more complex for the style, although it brings upfront both cold brew coffee and lots of vanilla. This Imperial Porter is almost a RIS.  I was in doubt if this was brewed with lager yeast as its Baltic peers or with ale yeast at controlled temperatures, given its purer yeast profile.  This has matured well after a couple of years since I bought this.

The coffee hits the taste buds first, and is a tad over-strong, though not particularly acidic. Probably cold brewed. The vanilla comes more on the finish, but is much more subtle. And at 10%, you're left with the feeling of alcohol on the back of the tongue, but not in a terrible way.  Overall: Great for an imperial, a little heavy on the coffee and light on the vanilla.

Head could be a tad creamier.  Smell - 4 - Very strong earthy coffee smell out of the bottle. Over time settles to a more coffee/vanilla smell  Taste - 4 - Again the smell of coffee and vanilla translate into taste. There is another flavor in there that I could not quite put my finger on that didn't quite resonate but I did look past that (see overall)  Feel - 4 - Again good traditional porter feel going down, thicker than say a pale ale, but not too thick. Initial taste of coffee gives way to vanilla    Overall - 4 - I am by no means a porter drinker. I was "exchanged" one of these for a taster of another brew from Ballast point. My true drink from Ballast point would be something like a Scuplin - unfiltered - or a Bonito or some such. Anyways I digress - I'm not a big porter (or stout) drinker. That said, this lives up to the description. There are, as mentioned above, some very strong coffee and vanilla flavors, and these work well with the overall taste of the beverage. I would imagine that if porter was your preferred drink type this would actually make you question reality and what you have been drinking your whole life. As for me, I can do one, occasionally, and I'll wander off into IPA land again, but it was a good excursion away from there and I was glad I took it - might just be a while before I'm back - but I know that is just personal taste as this is a good brew!

The problem with most Ballast Point beers is that they are a little too pricey. A 6 pack of cans is like $1 million. Are they trying to be the highest priced item at Sheetz? They're almost beef jerky expensive. Or those $20 scratch off lottery ticket expensive. Who buys those anyway? You'd be better off using that $20 on beer and at least feeling good about your life for an evening than pissing it away on a $20 scratch off.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a pure black color with a slim concave off white slightly foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Slim stringy lacing roams around the glass. The smell starts off with a rich roasty coffee and vanilla blend. A light cocoa enters in ever so slightly as it warms. The taste was roasty sweet cocoa and balances a slight bitterness from the coffee. A super smooth vanilla roastiness rolls over the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat oh so smooth and roasty coffee and vanilla. It’s a nice balancing act of flavors relinquishing delicacy of harshness but nothing overbearing. Overall, imperial porter - check. Awesomeness - check! As a night cap - priceless!   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 bottled 321st day of 2015. aged well.    Appearance- from a hardy pour into a libbey's porter glass it's a typical porter/ stout darkness (black). frothy tan head that leaves a medium amount of lacing. nothing crazy but good from looks.    Aroma- chocolate and vanilla mixed well. awesome smelling porter.    Taste- I don't get much coffee. it's more hardy in a burnt chocolate with a smack of vanilla which I find really good. alcohol is very well hidden which could be from the aging. other malts sorta mingle in the background like a biscuit taste but nothing crazy.    Mouthfeel- solid medium/ heavy bodied. great carbonation even from the aging. a slight silkiness.    Drinkability- glad I have another six pack aged just as long.    Overall- I had this fresh and I didn't find it anything crazy. if you want to try this brew I would recommend to age it at least a year. the alcohol is sooo well hidden. I was worried of it being too coffee heavy but not really. I would compare it aged to a founder's porter just in beast mode. hope they didn't change the recipe after the corporate sell out.

Not burnt coffee or flavored coffee, but fresh, ground coffee. There is some clear nuttiness, and a kiss of sweetness that is matched by a bit of salt. The taste is much richer than the nose would suggest. Roasted darkness and malts are the dominant tones, and the creamy vanilla/milky sweetness comes out in the back end, particularly as it warms. The mouth feel is luxurious; it's thick and present without being sticky or cloying. This is a really good beer, if not quite up to its rep on here.

Smells of Vanilla, with just a hint of chocolate and coffee.     Liquid Silk! So silky smooth, rich and creamy. The utterly robust Vanilla flavor gallantly gives way like a gentleman, to the ghostly-subtle chocolate & coffee. Aftertaste lingering serene.     The booze is extremely well hidden, especially for a 10%, Wise to be savored at home. Drinks with perilous ease.     Easily among the most delicious of brews.

Smells of coffee, spice, vanilla, maple syrup, and sweet extra toasted bread. Taste is dominated by semi sweet dark chocolate that has been laced with coffee. Feel is smooth, rich and decadent, and a touch of bitterness to end an initial onslaught of spiced sweetness, only to finish just a tad dry. A mild alcohol warmth considering its high abv. Overall, this is a good flavored imperial porter, and one that I don't mind revisiting from time to time. Cheers!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Black and opaque. Off-white head, not persisting and leaving a spare lacing.  High aroma of dark malt pronounced by a coffee aroma upfront. Decent burnt character, chocolate and some mild earthy and floral hops aroma. Soft bready notes, low aroma of esters like prunes. Later, when beer have got little bit warmer I could get some soft vanilla kind of whiskey smell.  High sweet, high dark chocolate flavor, medium-low bitter. Sweet aftertaste, chocolate kind.  Full body, creamy, oily, moderately low carbonation, smooth.     Delicious beer but burnt character covers heavily other values. I would like to see it more bitter IMO. Alcohol well covered anyway.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 L -- Pours a fairly dark reddish-black with a massive, four-finger tan head produced by a gentle/moderate pour. Decent retention and minimal lacing.  S -- The vanilla and coffee flavors definitely shine through here. Notes of dark chocolate, cinnamon, roasted malts, and toffee. Smells a lot like Cinnamon Toast Crunch, which gives it a somewhat gimmicky character.   T -- As prior reviewers have noted, the flavor palate in this brew is largely dominated by a stale coffee flavor that isn't particularly appealing. At this point in my beer drinking career, I think it's pretty obvious that nearly all brewers struggle with keeping the coffee flavor in their brews fresh. Occasionally they are successful (think Speedway Stout, Péché Mortel, etc.), but more often they are not. Otherwise the flavors here are good: mild chocolate, barley, vanilla, and a hint of bourbon on the finish.   F -- The 10% ABV is masked well. Medium body with a smooth, tapering finish.  O -- Hmmm.... Maybe it's just me, but I feel like many of Ballast Point's offerings are hella overrated. Victory at Sea is an easy 80/100, but no way is it a 97/100.    79/100   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Victory At Sea has a medium, beige head, a very dark brown appearance, with red shining through, at the bottom corners. There is a good amount of glass lacing present. Aroma is of rich, creamy coffee, vanilla, and dark malt, and the flavor is of those elements, with a rather harsh char, giving it a sort of burnt, acrid bitterness. Mouthfeel is low medium, and Victory At Sea finishes medium dry.     RJT

Not sure if the alcohol is getting to me, my taste buds are getting used to it, or is just mellows out at the end.  Overall not for me initially, but towards the end it does taste better. The peppermint version was the best of the 3 pack. I probably wouldn't buy this again as I trust my initial taste first.

This may very well be my new favorite craft beer. Dark oil look with definite coffee aroma. You can distinctly taste both vanilla and coffee flavored accented by the high gravity nature of this beer. Mouth feel is wonderful due to higher alcohol content and it surprisingly is smooth to drink. Winner in my book.

When others say "Espresso Stout" or something like that, you taste it and you're like "hmmmm, yeah, I think I can taste the coffee a bit there...."    This Porter tastes straight like stale coffee. I mean, stale coffee front, middle and back. Its like half and half world class beer with stale coffee and 100% authentic.     I personally love coffee and, hell, I even love stale coffee. I appreciate Ballast Point just being like "screw it, lets not even whiff of Soda Pop like other Porters....let's go full with this stuff." They really didn't pull any punches and the whole experience feels properly agrarian, making most other beers taste like processed food. That's a mixed blessing, but I appreciate this sort of experience being available.    Aside from that, it really hides the 10% ABV very well, though it lingers with a bitter aftertaste that is actually rather welcome, because it - again - is just so very authentic of a flavor. I almost felt a voice in the back of my head saying 'Duh! A beer like this SHOULD have an aftertaste as a matter of principle!'    That said, I'm probably only having one of these a night and any other beer consumption that evening will be something a bit lighter (i.e.. processed food); but, I do suspect that I'll be getting this one again.    I would also note that $14.99 for a six pack is greatly mitigated by the amazing power of these things, so it's actually a reasonable deal.    Any aficionado should at least try this one, IMO.

Appearance - black and ominous, with just a glint of light shining through from a reflection made on the table. Long lasting tan head, curtains of lacing left behind.    Smell - freshly brewed coffee, some vanilla present too but dialed back. Close to Peche Mortel on the nose alone.    Taste- loads of coffee, traces of vanilla and generally a bitter demeanour. Super delicious and wishing I could have another.    Mouthfeel - two words. Liquid velvet!    Overall- fantastic beer that lives up to the hype. Will have to pick up a six pack the next time I see it.    Edit** - November 3, 2017 - Wifey was across the border and happened to pick up a six-pack. Everything I remembered and more. This is probably the easiest drinking 10% ABV beer I've ever had. Just makes you want to go back for another (and another, and another). Wow. Awesome. Did I mention even the bottle art is effing spectacular?

Mild bitter aftertaste. Toffee.  Feel: Smooth, soft carbonation, medium-heavy body, slightly slick going down.

It has great lacing on the glass, and a nice creamy mouthfeel. The coffee has a somewhat mellow quality about it like one gets from a better roast.    I just keep enjoying this one more with each tasting. This is a great beer!

Pours a dark brown leading to a thin,frothy, khaki colored head.The body is dark brown / black,with very minimal light showing through the glass.Very light carbonation.    On the nose i get mostly coffee,and vanilla,with some notes of dark roasted malts.    The palate follows the nose.Coffee and vanilla in the lead,with dark roasted malts.Im also getting some toffee.    The body is medium / heavy with a smooth finish.    This is a VERY good porter.Probably top 5 in my book.Well done Ballast Point.

A small tan soapy head which disappears quickly, and some spotty lacing down the glass.   Aroma is fudgy, lots of vanilla, getting a little coconut, coffee is more in the background, or just subtle. A slight bit of a brown sugar vibe as well.  The flavor is more coffee than the aroma, nice big vanilla & fudge, light roasty malt.  Feel is above average carbonation, medium thin to medium body, and fairly dry overall, but a little sticky on the lips.   Overall, Big props for a great vanilla fudge flavor that's delicious. A little bit thin, but it is a porter, after all.

She recommended this & I agreed. She brought one out in an imperial stout glass for $8. I took one drink, handed her a $20, & said "bring me one more of these, pour them both in a Guinness glass, & we'll call it even. Best beer I've had in a while. An unqualified 5 out of 5. If you love stouts with a slightly sweet aftertaste, you'll love this. Very tasty!

For 10% abv it is very smooth, can barely taste the alcohol. It is more a breakfast stout than Founder's Breakfast stout. Also tastes more like a stout than a porter, but delicious nevertheless.  Poured into a goblet color is pitch black like a cold coffee with a creamy head that quickly diminished into a thin white line.  Aroma is of coffee and vanilla.  Body is medium filled with sweet sensations.   Perfect for Christmas morning, afternoon, or evening. Perfect for a snowy winter's day. Perfect beer on a day to stay home from work and enjoy before breakfast.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 On-tap served in a pint glass at Wishbeer, Bangkok.    Very deep brown to almost black in color, it tops with very thick silky tan head that stands with great strength of retention. The head just slowly dissipates to an eternal foamy sheet on the surface and leaves plenty of refined lacing patch and spot along the way.    Coffee hits first through a nose then cocoa, dark chocolate, and very slight astringency. Malt with its big roasted, rich vanilla, biscuit, caramel, and some smokiness. Suggestion of slight citric hop too.    The taste is quite like the aroma with big malty sweetness of vanilla, bread, biscuit, and caramel but it is not too overwhelming since it is counterbalanced by solid roasted, smoky, and coffee profile as well as citric hop and roasted bitterness.    Full body and super smooth mouthfeel throughout the palate with proper level of crispness and carbonation, finish is dry. Oh this Porter is truly a kill, it will never go wrong, very rich and luscious. In fact, I did try both on-tap and bottle and discover that from tap is more malty, coffee, chocolaty and is a bit better.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 12 oz. bottle poured into Ocelot glass.    L: Completely dark, zero brightness even near edges when held up to light. 2F head, good retention, leaves lots of fluffy lacing and a cap and ring.    S: To no great surprise, a lot of coffee, some roasted and caramel malts, and a tiny bit of vanilla on the back end.    T: A lot of black coffee, roasted and caramel malts, but not enough to balance the bitterness and acidity. Just a hint of vanilla on the back end. No alcohol presence, which is pretty impressive.    F: Medium to a little bit more in the body, a bit chewy but not overthick. Light to medium carbonation, more than you would expect, but it keeps it from being syrupy and cloying. Balance a bit off as it finishes a bit too bitter. Construction good. Good job of controlling alcohol.    O: A solid coffee porter with good value, but I definitely am not with the world-class crowd on this one, especially if I compare it with something like Morning Bell by Kane.

On the palate, the coffee and the vanilla come through clearly on the front with a nice roasted malt/dark chocolate profile on the back. Dark fruit in the mix somewhere, plus a mild alcoholic heat.    Always a tasty beer.

I had it on tap in San Diego a few years back. Or did I? I don't recall the alcohol being so clear. Hmm? I do remember thinking, however, that it was much more coffee-like (like opening a fresh bag of oily beans) than it was vanilla, and that remains. The vanilla is just a secondary note that helps to balance it, because let's face it, it is a pretty aggressive beer. It's strong, and it's completely saturated with coffee (one of the best coffee flavors I've ever had in a beer). There's an edge of dark roasted acidity to it, that along with the bitterness and alcohol brings it to an almost raspy finish. Note that I said almost. It's not quite there, but there's clearly enough that you'll know within the first quarter of the glass that this is not a beer to mess with. So is that good or bad? Depends on how you call it. Personally I think there's a time and place for every beer, and this one fits right in. But let's take a step back and cover the basics. Typical appearance. Opaque black-brown body with a thin edge of dark mahogany at the base of the glass. Creamy dark tan head. Decent head retention and lacing. Aroma of oily coffee beans. Roasty and nutty with a touch of pine but not much else. The flavor follows but adds some vanilla and coconut and heat from the alcohol, which brings us full circle. I'm actually finding a bit of heat at the back of the throat, but I don't recall that - I must have been asleep at the time! Haahaa! So where do I stand on this? Intense and aggressive beer, but not completely overdone... brilliant! The coffee and vanilla work together with the malt and hops and it all comes together in the end. Is it heavy handed? Yes, but that's part of the charm - if it was any less feisty it wouldn't have (no pun intended) the fire that it has, and it would just fall into a clump of similar vanilla/coffee porters. So what to do with it? Normally I might suggest this beer as a sipper after dinner, but I think it demands more than that. It's too full throttle to be a nightcap (unless you want to pass out ;), or just sit idly by in a snifter while you work through chapter 23 of Moby Dick. No, this is something else. Pair it up with a raunchy comedy-concert vid or action adventure flick. Or make it your one strong beer with a back yard BBQ (should go well with saucy ribs or a more refined steak). I think you get the idea.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Giant head- 3 inches or more- with visible carbonation flying up to replenish. Great retention. Thick and tan on top of a beautiful deep brown liquid. Great lacing too. Checks all the boxes for sure!    Delectable roast up front- not too dark, just perfect. Then a soft, herbal quality, a pleasant and light surprise, accompanied by what might even be the faintest touch of citrus. It works, trust me. Wondrous vanilla, bread, coffee again, and then some non-coffee roast flavors. Little chocolate. But the beautiful is in the name- some of the freshest coffee aromas I've ever encountered in beer, and the lovely, homely vanilla. I don't know which one makes me want a sip more. Together, I find myself willing to plunge my entire face into the glass. Injuries be damned.    First to the tongue is strong roast coffee- slightly acrid, even slightlier smoky, altogether wonderful. Quickly followed by the sweet and incredibly concentrated, but elegant, flavors of the vanilla. Herbal notes tickle, prickly coffee tones titillate mid-way. So damn fresh. Finish is the ubiquitous roast with some mellow bread. Mellow wasn't a way I would describe the beer until the exact moment I'm gulping down (and those malty tones coat the back of my throat and tongue). But now it's official. This beer has it all. Everything you could want- especially if you're a coffee junkie, or one of those people who takes a sip of the vanilla extract every time they bake a cake. Mid bitterness, mostly present on the finish. After is roast and vanilla, with chocolate building.     Mid-full body. Big and creamy but with prickly acidity as counterpoint. Kicks up and smacks the back of the mouth with every sip. And there's a touch of alcohol warmth, too!    Absolutely wonderful. Absolutely delicious!

Smell: not to strong, hint of caramel and vanilla malt.   Taste: very tasty, but contrary to other reviews I don't believe the flavor is overdone. Subtle hints of vanilla, coffee bean that are followed by nice alcohol finish. Very pleasant Coffee bean like after taste that lingers between sips.   Feel: although the head didn't last, it added to the feel. Broke up the thick porter with the slight carbonation. Very heavy feeling on the tongue like you have had a cup of coffee and need to brush your teeth, this stays throughout the beer while every drink is followed by a heavy but mostly smooth sense of alcohol.  Overall: this was an exceptional beer, probably my favorite porter to date. The coffee sets it apart from other beers, ballast point has come up with a perfect combination while most other brands tend to overload when using coffee flavors.

Has minimal head save for a few fine, beige bubbles at the rim. Despite this, there is some nice lacing. Nose is not overly strong but still has some enticing coffee notes. It's quite smooth, with a medium/medium-plus body.     Tastes lovely, with a hint of caramel along with some malty, choco sweetness. Coffee is quite pronounced though never harsh or bitter. The dark chocolate and roasty coffee blend nicely, with subtle vanilla lurking on the perimeter. Has a bit of florality in the finish, which is a tad on the dry side. Quite pleasant, overall.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Top notch imperial porter at a bargain price. Since it's Ballast Point, it's gonna enjoy wide availability despite being a less accessible style. But this bad boy achieves a level of smoothness and blend that I think a lot of smaller craft brewers would kill for in their strong coffee ales. It would be a session beer if not for the high alcohol content, which is totally masked by the flavor balance. I know this is sacrilege but I might choose this over Founders Breakfast Stout... it's very similar but a step up in terms of smoothness. I've had a few and they're consistent every year, never bitter or funky. If you don't like heavy vanilla or sweet ales I'd avoid it, personally I dig that type of thing. Not as glamorous as some baltic/imperials but outstanding craftsmanship.

In the aroma the coffee is not as pronounced, but it is still there; still has a great mouthfeel; there's plenty of complexity in the taste. It even still had plenty of carbonation. I had it in a side-by-side with the High West Barrel aged version, and I think I prefer the regular. AMAZING!    What I love about this beer is how well balanced the coffee notes are with the hops and the other wonderful things in here. I like that it's not as dry as some porters tend to be. This beer has a great aroma as well. I think I prefer this to Founder's Breakfast stout.   This is an amazing beer. I am currently drinking it with a year of age on it, and it hasn't suffered in the slightest; as a matter of fact, it's been awhile since I had this beer last, and yet I think it improved with age. I had it in a side-by-side with Ska's Ten Pin Imperial Porter; the Victory at Sea was not only more complex but it was clearly more flavorful. This is a beer worth seeking out.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Presentation: 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.    Look: Black as night with a 1.5 finger dark tan head. Very good head retention.    Smell: Coffee with undertones of malts, very faint vanilla, and finishes with warming alcohol.    Taste: Coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and alcohol. The alcohol is a bit harsh and has a tendency to overpower everything else.    Feel: Slightly thick mouthful,moderate carbonation, and finishes on the dry side.    Overall: Well crafted but the harshness of the alcohol overwhelms this beer.

Appearance: It poured an almost black colour with a just over one finger tanned head that had decent retention and left sparse lacing.    Aroma: Roasted coffee bean, milk chocolate with hints of vanilla plus caramel.    Taste: Starts with roasty malt and bittersweet chocolate, followed by light caramel sweetness and a hint of vanilla. Finishes with strong espresso bitterness.    Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium to full bodied with low carbonation.    Overall: Not getting as much vanilla as I would have hoped for, but still has nice roasty and bittersweet chocolate and coffee flavours.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours shiny black with three inviting fingers of eggshell head. Forgoes the cloying smell of vanilla essence to waft genuine vanilla pods into my gaping face. Add creamy coffee and this smacks of a quality tiramisu - yes, this is a fabulous desert beer.    Having had Victory at Sea a good few times, I would note that some batches lean substantially more toward coffee than vanilla, and vice versa. I've had bottles of this that taste like chocolate milk, and others that taste more like a nice cold brew. This temperamentality doesn't carry over to the feel, however, which always masks the ABV as pleasant warmth in the throat.     A very welcome mainstay.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Whoa. Vanilla.     I really wanted to like this beer. The nose is amazing. It looks perfect. But...    It tastes like vanilla extract to me. Perhaps I am over sensitive to vanilla, but that is the only note I got. And it was STRONG.     So, if you like vanilla, you'll love this beer.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 An outstanding Porter even though I am not a big fan of vanilla in my Porters or Stouts. Pours a dense dark brown color from a12 oz bottle into a pint glass. No light gets through the glass. Big dark tan head with excellent retention and thick bands of lacing on the glass. Aroma is a malty Porter with a good amount of coffee and some vanilla. Flavor is more of the same, very rich and creamy. Mouthfeel is smooth, rich and creamy with no hint ofthe10.% abv. An excellent brew, well worth having again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Big coffee and vanilla notes on the pour - almost a bourbon aroma is present too. Color is a deep red opaque black - 1/2 finger head. The taste is a smokey smooth, sweet deep malty coffee/toffee flavors, balanced with hops on the finish. A big sticky but still very drinkable. Medium carbonation and creamy mouth feel with a some slight alcohol heat. This baby clocks in at 10% ABV but the alcohol is barely detectable. It doesn't taste like a 10% ABV which can be dangerous - i.e. it will put you on your donkey pretty quick if you're not paying attention. Probably works best as a "sipper" with a premium cigar. Overall this is a great beer - could have been a coffee/vanilla stout IMO but they chose to call it a porter but so be it - it's definitely worth a try for sure.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Appearance: Black with scarlet and burgundy hues, pours with a syrupy like body, a good couple fingers of cafe au lait coloured foam that does settle fairly moderately leaving a panoramic valley of lacing all the way around the glass with some well kept topographical surface interests.     Aromatics: Dark sweetness and finely roasted coffee, and that sweet vanilla showing through very nicely. There is subtle dark cacao and with plums and dates there as well    Taste: Big Bold Beautifully Dark and Rich. You almost get the impression you are sitting down to enjoy a morning iced coffee until you get a bit of that little breath of the 10%… but still it really is no different than pouring a little liquor into your coffee. The blended flavours are very well formulated into a nice cohesive concoction. The coffee and vanilla are on equally playing field with the malts.    Feel: Exquisite full bodied and creamy soft with little pips of crispness here and there from the carbonation that though it is muted, is still active enough to fizz up the palate. It also has a fairly juicy quality that makes me want to consume in mouthfuls rather than sips. That 10% giving up a bit of warmth and a slight vapourness, and the cacao/coffee bitter tends to lazily wander about after the mostly dry finish.     Overall: If I had a massive oversized teddy bear I could snuggle into to binge watch my old childhood favourites (Voltron, Mazinger, and the animated D&D); in an empty house; on a long weekend; before I started my 2 weeks of holidays; this is a beer I will shortlist for that journey. I don’t mind porters, but I love stouts, and this one really encroaches on stouts property. Now I wonder what would happen if you get this on a nitro tap?     Pairing : I love the nautical theme of Ballast Point in general, and the Jack Skellington character currently on the Victory at Sea label wants be to thrown on Jaws or the first Pirates of the Caribbean DVD. While that is starting up, I’m going to go to my pub fare cook book and land on page (roll my d20 a couple times) p 34… Cheeseburger Meatball Stew! Now I should note that I make mini (half inch) meatballs from an 80/20 (beef/pork) mixture of 2 to 3 lbs - sometimes I add cheddar to the meatballs before I bake them at 350 for about 30 min until they are crispy and cooked throughout, then I cool them and throw them into half-pound ziploc freezer bags just for occasions like this! Your basic beef stew with diced potatoes, carrots, celery, onion, and I like spice so a dice jalapeño our two will make it in there too. Ideally I would prep this ahead of time and make it in a slow cooker - Throw in all the ingredients and my meat balls and simmer on high for a good 4 to 5 hours. But today, it’s into the stove-top pot not Medium-high for the first hour of the movie at least. once the basic stew is ready to serve (potatoes are done) I scoop a bowl and throw-in a half dozen cubes of fresh cheddar or cheese curds… with a brad for dipping and beer at the ready, it should all work out quite wonderfully.

Nose is coconut, chocolate, and a touch of heat. Really nice. Rich and inviting.    Baker's chocolate, coffee, oak, and pine. Intense but smooth. Definitely an Imperial. Roasty, warming, and big.    Mouthfeel is medium, could be a bit fuller.     Overall, definitely a great porter. A little strong for my tastes, but to be expected at 10% alcohol.

(4.25)	    S:	  Maple whipped cream with a shot of espresso, cinammon, chocolate milk. (4.25)	    T:	  Smooth band of sweetness that progressively gets roastier and roastier, some astringency, baker's chocolate, coffee, vanilla, toasted bark, boozy twang at the end that almost seems like a barrel. (4.25)	    M:	  Thick, active carbonation, stickyish, vague astringent charry afterburn, some detectable alcohol. (4.25)	    O:	  Nice beer.   It's really sweet (to me at least) but the flavors go well together. Thick black beer with a decent head. The aroma and flavor are both that of spiced coffee with chocolate and vanilla. It is fairly drinkable, the alcohol is not well-hidden, a touch hot. Would be a great beer in the winter, no doubt about it.   Would have again. I am not much on random ingredients beyond the standards, but beers like this are good ones to shut me up. (4.25)

Pours robust as fuck like you just popped the top on an imperial stout. Good 1/2" tan head. Aroma drops significant coffee, respectable roast malt, and a hint of vanilla.    Taste is world class. Very easy to drink, all the roasted malt, vanilla and coffee really cover up the 10% abv. Not overly acidic or acrid either, somehow manages to pull off being smooth. Coffee, chocolate malt, vanilla beans, not a small run, that they can pull this off in large batches and big distribution gets even more points in my book.     World class.

Strange that I didn't notice any in the smell, but its flavor is loaded with vanilla. It's a warm, boozy vanilla, sweet, with lots of roasted malts. Very good tasting beer. It could use more carbonation, but otherwise I like it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Phenomenal beer. Jet black and thick with a big mocha head that laced beautifully. Smell is big and rich with strong notes of roasted coffee, soft vanilla, maple syrup, and bakers chocolate. The overall aroma experience can be greatly muted if the beer is overly cold (realized through first-hand mistakes), so give it a chance to warm up a bit. Taste follows suit with big and rich flavors of dark roast coffee, toasted almond, molasses, caramel, dark chocolate, light licorice, and a wonderful sweet vanilla that appears late in the sip but lingers wonderfully. Little more astringent than I was expecting, but there's certainly a lot of bitter coffee there. Feel is medium-bodied and silky, with just the right weight. Pretty great, well-rounded porter, and the added vanilla is a real positive. The only way it would be better is if the chocolate and coffee notes were a little more balanced toward the former.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 12 oz longneck into a nonic pint. Black with just the faintest of brown highlighting around the very edge of the glass under illumination. Topped with a dense two-finger tall light brown head that falls away slowly. Lacing is very good.    Nose has very big notes of vanilla beans, with coffee and a hint of caramel. Barely smells like beer, but smells great anyway.    Flavor is much as the nose would suggest right up front- vanilla and black coffee tones, that progress into dark roasted malts, toffee and bittersweet chocolate. These sweet-er notes come much more to the fore as the beer warms. The finish is long and dry, with a pleasing espresso-like bitterness.    Mouth-feel is big, sticky, and chewy, on the girth-y side for a Porter. This is definitely a 'sipping' beer, even with the big flavors doing a pretty good job limiting the 10% ABV hit to just a gentle warmth.     Victory at sea is a great beer for fans of "big" beers... The sheer size of this beer rivals quite a few Stouts. The flavor profile here isn't necessarily complex, opting instead for a focused set of huge notes, well balanced with each other and delivered with tremendous feel in the mouth.

Two inches on a strong pour into a tulip glass, but it receded quickly leaving medium lacing.     S: Fresh roasted coffee smell is nearly overpowering. Some vanilla on the nose, but nothing compared to the coffee. Hints of booze, but less than you would expect from a beer packing a 10% punch.     T: Fresh roasted oily coffee beans hit you immediately. Vanilla starts out soft and then strengthens to become the dominant aftertaste. Bakers chocolate and roasted malts sit behind the coffee. Aftertaste is vanilla, coffee, and subdued booze.     F: Great. Smooth and well carbonated without being excessive. Full bodied yet soft.     O: A great beer for anyone who enjoys stouts and porters with dominant coffee notes. I appreciate the total absence of dark fruit. Not a complex beer, but a very flavorful one. Definitely will drink again.

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Picked up a six-pack of 12 oz bottles at the Trig's Cellar 70 in Minocqua. The bottling code suggests this one is good for another four months. Poured at cellar temperature into my Samuel Smith pint glass.    L: Pours a deep cola brown--caramel colored at the edges where the light strikes through--with a good three fingers of frothy, dense khaki head that sticks around for a very long time and leaves substantial even lacing on the glass. A beautiful-looking beer.    S: Big, robust coffee and sweet vanilla notes in the bouquet, as advertised. A touch of cinnamon and dark drinking chocolate in the mix. Maybe a bit of earthiness. Just the slightest amount of clear alcohol, which actually is a pleasant addition to whole show.    T: Dark malts--roasty, sweet, and chocolaty--very assertive right out of the gates. Quite a bit more chocolate flavor than the nose forecasts. There's an instant astringency felt as the coffee and vanilla flavors kick in. The middle is really dominated by the coffee--very roasty and robust--with just enough of that sweet vanilla to keep things in check. The middle also brings out a bit of cinnamon and clear alcohol. The back end has that coffee and vanilla continuing atop the dark malts, with a more pronounced clear alcohol and earthy bitterness. The close is significantly bitter, with a healthy amount of alcohol flavor accompany the coffee and vanilla in the aftertaste.    F: Medium-bodied. Extremely smooth. While it isn't syrupy, it does have a good deal of bitter stick to it's close. Nice level of carbonation at the start, though it does feel a bit flat by the end of the glass.    O: This is one impressive porter. Huge coffee and vanilla notes and big ABV make it drink almost like a barrel-aged stout. Perhaps most impressive to me is how well-balanced the flavors are in this one: the malt bill plays extremely well with the other additions, and it yields a beer that is very flavorful and engaging. I definitely recommend giving this a try if you haven't already.

Victory at Sea from @ballastpointbrewing shivers your timbers like being boarded by Captain Barbosa and his crew of curs'ed souls. The aroma is black coffee backed with notes of caramel. The body, rich and strong, bringing in more coffee with a hint of vanilla. As you sip the lace clings to the glass like barnacles as it coats your palate like the spray from a winter swell. Balanced perfectly by a finishing of hop bitterness to complete the voyage of this nautical libation.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 This is a solid porter, and so roasty it's practically in Russian stout territory. Pours black, with a small even head that goes away quickly with very little lacing. Smells of coffee and toffee. Slight vanilla and tobacco.    Taste is initially bitter and clean, then creamy roast coffee comes right the hell in. It's sweet, not from vanilla so much as a dark fruit kind of thing. Raisiny. Fair amount of booze in the taste and finishes with a vanilla - y creaminess. Oily, resiny, and some char. As it opens up it's like a rum-soaked cigar you dropped in your aunt's cold coffee. Better than it sounds.     An aggressive coffee porter. Not as subtle as Stone's Americano Stout which it somewhat resembles; the roast coffee here pretty much overpowers the vanilla. Note the version in a 22oz bomber seems more creamy than the 12 oz bottles in my experience. In spite of the 10% ABV though, I'm drinking it faster than I should.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This was an excellent porter for me. One of my favorites. Just the right amount of sweet and bitter combination. The beer had a dark brown/chocolate color and a nice 1/4" creamy head. It smelled of bitter coffee with undertones of vanilla and caramel/toffee. The taste at first was bitter but as my tastebuds got used to the beer the better and better it tasted until I was running on empty. The beer taste combination of coffee, vanilla bean, caramel and molasses was a great porter recipe and it had a warm creamy feel in your mouth and down the throat. Highly recommended.

The taste was even better..and I think I told my wife so, about 10 times. Very smooth, with no complaints at all.. I'm really looking forward to another round of this top-notch beer.

O- Great porter, I could do with less booze at the taste but I cant count it as a flaw knowing this is a 10% brew. Amazing.

T: Tastes like freshly made creamy iced coffee, rich gourmet dark chocolate italian ice, sweet hazelnut, mocha, vanilla beans and dry, mild tobacco. Has a resinous, hoppy finish. It's so delicious it's hard to put down and stop drinking    F: It's slightly sticky and syrupy, but thats the only thing I can find wrong with the beer. Rich, powerful and flavorful. Starts of sweet, finishes dry. You can tell it's got some alcohol in it, but it doesn't feel like a 10 percenter.     O: If they sold this in six packs, this would be a go to beer I would keep in the fridge all year round. It's superb. If you like vanilla, chocolate, coffee and dark beer this will flip your lid. Without a doubt world class beer.

The smell of coffee and vanilla, along with roasted grains. The taste of was the same as the aroma. Roasted Malts, Vanilla and coffee, with a little tartness for a porter. But, the flavor out weight's the tartness. An exceptional flavored porter.

I could smell the coffee when I opened the bottle. After it was poured the vanilla aroma becomes more present. The flavors are very well balanced, and the beer is like a delicious desert with a cup of coffee. The mouthfeel is smooth, rich, and warm. If you like these types of beers, do not pass this one up!

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Dark brown with a cream and caramel head - both colors interwoven. Head not too thick, moderately durable. Nose - tomatoes? Sweet chocolate and/or vanilla. Vegetable notes. Also fudgy. Dense. Taste: big luscious thick vanilla fudge and coffee. A few hops in there somewhere in the sweet swirls. Like the nose also some vegetable notes, including a moment where I thought it tasted like green beans. Ends with a bit of tingle. Mouthfeel tingly and thick. Impressive, but I am not sure that I'd like too many repeats; it would be like eating box chocolates every night for dinner.    Bottle poured into nonic. Stamp on bottom included "16037" which I interpret as 6 Feb 2016 (day 37 of 2016).

This beer is a fantastic beer if you like the things it is supposed to represent. Which is coffee, porter/stout flavors, and a shitload of vanilla. The aroma is slight vanilla, with loads of coffee, bakers chocolate, and roasted malt. When I first taste this beer, there is an intense vanilla taste which is extremely pleasant if you enjoy vanilla. I do feel this taste fades into the background as it warms which is contrary to most vanilla brews. Their is a huge coffee note that is very similar to an intense dark roasted artisan coffee. It is not acrid though it is quite bitter. To me the vanilla and coffee seem to dominate the palate, with the bakers chocolate and slight overall stout/porter flavors following through afterwards. This is one of my favorite coffee beers, and probably the best representation I've had of vanilla in a beer yet. The alcohol is very well masked but this beer will put you on your ass! Try this beer if you love coffee, stouts, and vanilla!

Flavor is similar with more sweet vanilla both complementing the roasty toastedness This is extremely smooth mouthfeel and slightly sweet finish.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25 Pours black with red highlights. Huge tan head, substantial lacing.     Smells of roasting coffee. caramel, toffee.     Coffee bean flavors are pronounced, and nicely balances the porter sugar sweetness. The vanilla flavor lags and is less pronounced. This is more of a cappuccino than a latte. Creamy smooth bitter finish and hardly a trace of the alcohol. There is a sweet toffee feel in the long finish, It's amazing how they built something with such pronounced flavor without making it over the top. All flavors are welcomed.     I like coffee, I like beer, I like vanilla, I like this.

It's a beautiful beer, an aggressive pour gave two fingers of thick tan foam that left wonderful rings on the glass as it settled down to a protective skiff covering an opaque black body. The nose is dark roasted grain, coffee, and sweetness, with some hints of vanilla, and no booziness. The taste is the same except the vanilla becomes more prominent, it gains a fair amount of bitterness, and some chocolate notes peak through. The body reads porter to me, substantial but not imperial stout levels of chewiness. All in all a delightful vanilla and coffee imperial porter that goes down dangerously smooth given it's ABV.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 I really poor this one with some oomph to try and generate some head. And I may have overdid it a little bit as I easily generated over three fingers of fluffy, brown head. The body is a gorgeous, perfect to style jet blackness. Lots of lace is left behind as the head slowly turns rocky and recedes. The nose is very vibrant and full of coffee that tingles the nose it is so bright. The aroma also includes soft Coco and vanilla notes. With first sip I quickly think of a jamocha milkshake. Flavors include tons of chocolate and rich creamy coffee and just so pleasant to enjoy. This beer is very dessert like and in all the right ways. It is bold and dynamic and flavor yet approachable and not offputting in anyway. All the flavors come together in gel so well. The vanilla plays as the perfect coffee creamer and overall balancer to the brew. The alcohol is very well hidden in this beer but I think it has the legs to age for probably 2 to 3 years.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Pours very dark, and thickly with a nice head. The smell is very nicely vanilla with malt overtones. Taste is very strong and good - this one has some punch. Body is quite full - a very pleasant feel to the mouth as you drink. One of the best I have had.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass.    Appearance is deep black in color with moderate yet creamy tan head.    Smell is roasted malt/coffee with some vanilla (very little alcohol coming through).    Taste follows the nose but packs a bigger punch with a lot of roasted coffee. There is some good sweetness up front with a fairly dry finish.    Mouth feel is medium-full in body and creamy (a little syrupy). The carbonation is fairly low/flat but works well throughout.    Overall this is a very good coffee porter. It is relatively easy to drink but has a lot of roasted malt and coffee flavors.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours very dark brown with a poorly retained one and a half inch head. Smells of coffee and more coffee with a hint of vanilla. Taste is that of slightly sweetened coffee, vanilla, chocolate, molasses and a little bit of bitterness on the finish. Light to moderate carbonation, smooth and silky on the palate. Outstanding beer.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 From a bomber bottle. Classic stout/porter look. Beautiful dark brown color, fluffy tan head, lacing to spare (or a really dirty glass, but I will give B. Point the benefit of the doubt). Nose has a little coffee, with the vanilla coming out as it warms --could be more inviting. Taste is dominated by bitter black coffee -- a little too much lingering coffee bitterness more my taste (and I like my coffee black and strong) - vanilla on the side of the tongue, but I was hoping for more. Not getting much of the sweetness others describe. Mouth feel a little thin. Could be smoother. I was looking forward to this porter, fully expecting to love it, but it just didn't do it for me. Maybe I got an off batch?

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Pours dark and cloudy with a one finger brown head. Has a boozy aroma with coffee and sweet dark chocolate. The flavor of chocolate and coffee are a punch in the face, fading into more vanilla and sweetness, leaving behind some bitterness and more roasty coffee. 10% alcohol is somewhat hidden, but not entirely as this doesn't go down without any notice. Flavor is great, but the feel and character are a bit toned down as it's somewhat light and a little bit watery. For a mass produced porter, this is certainly exceptional.

The 10% ABV is not detected at all. No bitter aftertaste. Delicious!  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied beer that is smooth as silk. Light amount of carbonation.  Overall: I have not sampled many porters, but after trying this amazing beer, I think I will have to try many more.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 A- Love the artwork of the label! The brew is more of a heavy dark brown than the traditional blackish tones I'm used to seeing....and it appears to be thick in nature. The head is meringue like a creamy espresso foam like color...the retention is most excellent, and eventullly looks like sponge toffee! The carbonation is much too hard to see and lacing is superb! A lovely looking porter!!    S- Super heavy cocoa power aromas upfront, with background smells of high cocoa content dark chocolate, very fresh dark roast coffee, vanilla sweetness, charred black malts, burnt nuttiness and Earth...super balanced and smooth aromas...Wow!!    T- This is awesome!!! Highly regulated smooth balancing flavors such as cocoa bean, blended dark chocolate, cold press espresso, burnt almond nuttiness, fresh vanilla bean to sweeten things up slightly, hints of toffee/caramel/molasses and the finish is dry, robust and bold, with mellow hopped bitterness....simply amazing!!    M/O- This is one of the most delicate beers I've ever experienced on the palate....the body gently tickles the tongue with wee tight bubbles that explode with a smooth vigor....enhancing the overall flavors/character. I refuse to believe that this is 10% alcohol...that's how well hidden the booze is within this brew! A very highly drinkable porter that is spot on for the style and I am afraid of what will happen the next time I purchase this, as it will be more than one bottle!! OUTSTANDING!!

Had I known it would have been the first and only one for nearly a year I would have bought more. 10%. Dark. Coffee. I loved it. I didn't think much of it other than it was cheap enough for a 10% porter.     It pours well. Little dark head. The smell hit me hard. The vanilla really works with the strong coffee smell. Almost a touch skunky. I loved it!     Then after trying to get my hands on some for nearly a year they finally released some. The first batch I tried wasn't as I remembered. The vanilla was way too strong. It wasn't terrible but not what I fell in love with. Then about a month later another batch was delivered in my area. This was what I was missing.     One of my favorite beers. Most wont agree but I like this better than KBS or Goose Island's Bourbon County. That's just me though.     Strong coffee smell mixed with vanilla. Goes down smooth. I love to pair it with some Trader Joe's 72% dark chocolate. Can't wait to have another soon!

Head slowly dissipates leaving sticky tan lacing along the glass and a half finger film along the top of the beer.    Smell is full of aromas of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts and undertones of vanilla.     Taste follows the nose with lots of coffee flavor up front. Notes of sweet vanilla and chocolate come through giving way to a pleasant bitter finish.     Feel is a bit thin, with mild carbonation.     Overall a really enjoyable and flavorful porter from ballast point. If you enjoy coffee and vanilla you'll love this one. I know I certainly do.

Dark roasted coffee on the back end.    Taste: Tons of roasted malts and rich dark coffee flavor covered in a perfect touch of vanilla. The finish has more of a sharp hop bitterness.     Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, pretty smooth for 10% ABV.    Overall: This goes down way too easy for 10% ABV. Perfect amount of vanilla, and tons of roast.

Reading the reviews, I thought this would be unbelievable but it was merely very good. I felt the tasted a bit too much like burnt coffee and the vanilla took a bit too much of a back seat to the coffee. that being said I might be splitting hairs. It was still very good. A nice nightcap after a long day in early March.

Darker than I expected, almost imperial stout like but without the heaviness. Smells of roasted malt and coffee. Taste of roasted mealtimes/wood with coffee. Vanilla is definitely there but more in the aftertaste to me. A overall good beer.

Pours a thick black with a nice head. The head is thick and fluffy, and the lacing sticks to the glass like honey. Some red hue, the beer is nearly pitch black.    S: Remarkable. Among the best-scented stouts/porters ever! Tons of chocolate and coffee - some vanilla as well, but the dark malts dominate. Exquisite.    T: Great. Nice burnt coffee malt with lingering cocoa. Also a lot of vanilla to balance out the dark malt. Great.    F: Little lighter than expected. Pretty easy drinking.    O: A great beer. So glad BP started distro in Indiana.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a 12 oz bottle to a stout glass.    L - Intense head, actually lost control of it despite a standard pour. Settled down nicely to a fluffy tan mound on top of the beer, almost looking like a rootbeer float. A lot of thick lacing the whole way down the glass. Beer is very dark brown, almost black.    S - Strong up-front aroma of dark malts gives way to rich vanilla, then finally coffee. Not the aroma-canon of some sweet stouts, but very complex. Not only does it look like a rootbeer float, it smells like one, too.    T - A great example of the blurred line between stouts and porters. They call this a porter, but it's everything people usually think of when the talk about stouts. Rich, complex flavor. Probably the smoothest beer I've ever had in the 10% range, as the alcohol is practically invisible. Dark caramel malt flavors are backed up by coffee flavor. Much lighter roast than some other coffee beer, but that fits the style well. Vanilla is more present in aroma than it is in flavor, but it's there at a distance. Faint hop spice for good balance. Alcohol warms as it goes down, with no unpleasant aftertaste.    F - Rich, creamy mouthfeel. Very full, and almost chewy. Absolutely what I want in a porter.    It's understandable why this has the reputation it does. An excellent experience the whole way through. Not quite as drinkable as a typical porter, but with enough body that you probably don't want to finish it quickly, anyway.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 L: The pour is opaque and dark. The head is thin and brown.    S: The smell of coffee is overpowering.    T: At the front of the palette the taste of coffee and malts has a nice blend that works well with each other. As the beer moves to the back of the palette the vanilla kicks in giving it a somewhat sweet finish. The flavors are very well balanced and compliment each other.    F: It coats the mouth nicely and leaves a nice coating when you are finished. It is a medium body beer, not to thick, not to thin, just right.    O: I think this is a great brew. All the parts compliment each other beautifully. The coffee flavor isn't overpowering except for the smell and the vanillas finish is a nice touch.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 A - Dark body, opaque, with light tan head, some lacing.    S - Roasted malts, profound coffee, chocolate, and vanilla, and a bit of alcohol warmth.    T - Following the nose, with toasted bread elements, molasses, and strong chocolate and vanilla. Close is somewhat acidic and bitter.    M - The feel is full. Bright. Close is surprisingly clean.    O - A fine, fine porter, and rich and lush. Great flavor. And well balanced for the ABV. Lovely.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours deep brown with both black and lighter caramel highlights. 1 finger head is dark tan in color. Head dissipates down to a thin layer of foam with good sticky lacing left behind.    Rich, dark roasted coffee aroma, mildly bitter. Caramel malt, molasses, and raw grain. Just a hint of citrus. Vanilla isn't noticeable at first but comes out as the beer warms. Still pretty mild though.    Rich, dark roasted, black coffee. Mild bitter chocolate. Caramel malt and dark bread dough. Vanilla is more prominent than the nose but still only an accent, not a main flavor. Some earthiness. Sweetness and vanilla flavor increases on the back end.    Rich, full bodied feel on the tongue. Medium carbonation. Mild bitterness with a creaminess on the tongue. Lingering black coffee.    Excellent beer with strong but smooth dark roasted coffee notes. Would like a boost in the vanilla. Drinks easier than 10% would indicate.

This beer reminds me of the perfect cup of Iced coffee . Great with a cookie or a muffin. You want to drink it for breakfast. Also great introductory beer for those naysayers , especially women who may have dislikes the beers they've had in the past. I only tried this beer as two women who said they disliked beer in the past had this one and they said it changed their minds about beer .    They were right. It is "a game changer."

M - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Smooth creamy mouthfeel. Sticky dry finish.    O - This is an awesome coffee Porter. The ABV is well hidden and not noticeable. A definite winner.

It was rich and dark with notes of dark chocolate and coffee coming through.    Feel: Great thickeness which compliments all of the flavors. A beer you almost wished never ended.    Overall: As this is only my 3rd beer rating on BA I don't have the palate of others but definitely recommed this beer. It was one of my most enjoyable thus far, cheers.

Well-balanced with nice coffee & vanilla flavours on top of the dark malts & roasted flavours, it was an outstanding beer & one of the better porters I've tried so far, although Orkney Porter probably still comes out on top.

Mouthful is medium and smooth with low carbonation. Finish is a little bitter but dry.    This is a big coffee porter. Aroma is there. Taste is there. The minor criticism is the somewhat bitter finish but don’t let that dissuade you. Give it a try.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours a deep black with a 1cm khaki head that dissipates quickly. Smells faintly of coffee and malt, but the taste is not faint at all - rich coffee blends beautifully with the beer leaving a dry and pleasantly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is tremendous for a porter, but would be considered a little watery if comparing to stouts. I am primarily a stout guy and don't usually enjoy porters but this is an exception - my favorite porter hands down.

The strong bitterness of the espresso and malt stays with you until the end where you feel it linger top of your mouth and back of your tongue. Alcohol is strong and carb is well known. Full bodied and very smooth. It's a beer that want's to be noticed and indeed you will notice. Very tasty beer and will look for a 6 pack to buy.

Smell - Sweet chocolate with mild coffee, not overpowering and surprisingly mellow, not overpowering at all.  Taste - Sweet malt taste with very mild coffee and vanilla, very sweet on the back end and very smooth. Taste is very moreish leading to small frequent sips.  Feel - Lighter than the alcohol content and appearance would suggest. Nice mild carbonation which may be the key to the lighter feel of this heavier beer.  Overall - Great beer and a new favorite. I love coffee but hate when it overpowers all other flavors and the balance here is just right for me.

Atop sat a milkshake like 1-1/2 finger tan that held well. The nose is dominated by coffee and roasted malts. Coffee and roasted malts are the first flavors detected followed by dark fruit, caramel, and chocolate. The coffee and roasted flavor seem to overpower the vanilla as only very little is noted. I was hoping for a stronger vanilla taste to come through. The mouth feel is rather full bodied, thick and creamy with a light bitter finish.     My first brew from Ballast Point and I am a fan. Good representation of the style. Remember, do not drink this Ale too cold as the flavor really comes out when it is warmer.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I cracked open this porter in the fall of 2015. Very deep and rich vanilla notes that pair well with the strong alcohol presence. Ballast Point does it again.

Its that type of bitterness you get from an espresso with no sugar. Alcohol slightly present. I was expecting more.

Coffee and very bitter burnt nut upfront gradually give way to a light sweetness and the slightest hint of vanilla in the finish. Smooth, full bodied feel with a slight tack.    Roasted burnt coffee is a little too forward and overwhelming right off the bat. Unfortunately it continues in such a way that only hint of sweetness and vanilla break through at the end. Not a bad overall flavor but not completely as promised and just a little heavy handed on the roasted flavors.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 12oz bottle with no bottle date to be found; I think it's fair to assume that it's fresh as Ballast Point is making a return to my area after a long hiatus.    Look - Pours a deep dark brown with minimal foam. Even a heavy pour seems to yield little foam.    Smell - For a beer labeled "Coffee Vanilla" I smell surprisingly little of either. It's a well-crafted beer with notes of a typical porter roast and chocolate, but with time (and a little warmth) the sweetness and distinct coffee notes are there.    Taste - Again, like the smell, I really expect more coffee and vanilla from a beer labeled this way. However, it's a fantastic beer. Victory at Sea skews very bitter for the style. It's actually a blessing that Ballast Point was delicate with the coffee and vanilla; it's very much in balance with the expected porter roast and just makes this beer a little rounder with more depth. Any more of either and it would be a gimmick or dessert beer. This beer is intensely bitter, almost to the point of being some sort of Black DIPA. Almost. This beer is an imperial porter through and through.    Feel - Right on target for a beer like this. It has more body and feel than a porter, but they didn't bump up the viscosity for the sake of being chewy or heavy. It finishes remarkably without really coating the palette.     This beer would pair excellently with tomato and brown sugar beef-based BBQ from Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma or Texas. Victory at Sea with beef burnt ends might be a good last meal.     It took me several beers (over several days) to really understand Victory at Sea; It's an Imperial Porter with a distinct west coast slant. It's not a beer for everyone, nor a beer that I want every day. However, I enjoy this beer more every time I drink it, and that's quite rare. Outstanding.

Aroma is just like cold brewed black coffee with some roast and vanilla coming through as well. Taste follows with coffee, chocolate, vanilla, roast, and robust dark malts with a little bit of almost rye bread and dark chocolate on the fringes. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth, a little harsh when the beer is cold, but smooth as it warms. Overall, a very nice coffee brew that holds up with the porter backbone making it easy to drink and all the flavors coming through.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Ballast Point Brewing Company - Victory At Sea. 10% ABV. 12oz bottle poured into snifter.    Look: Settles a viscous pitch black, with some caramel highlights, albeit very minor. Non aggressive pour caused a small mocha colored head, which settles into lacing after a little.    Smell: Incredibly strong coffee grounds, very overpowering if you don't expect it. I assume it the particular blend of coffee used in it, which gives it a very earthy aroma with the coffee, almost like a fresh green pepper. Very strange smelling.    Feel: Thick, heavy body, but also very creamy and smooth at the same time. Has some decent amount of carbonation accompanying it.    Taste: Very strong and bitter coffee grounds immediately, but mellows out about midway through, allowing some caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, and dark malts to show up. Nice blend into the back end, but soon the rich coffee shows back up, accompanied by some dark chocolate into the aftertaste.    Overall: Been wanting to try this for a while, because it sounds amazing, and to see if it lives up to its high reputation. I was expecting a lot of coffee, and this still caught me off guard. Extreme amounts of robust bold coffee on the palate, but is balanced extremely well by the other flavors. The only thing I don't care for is the odd aroma of earthy green pepper in my nose every time I take a drink, but since it comes from the coffee that gives such an amazing taste, I would rather not change a thing.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Looks. Dark, dark, dark,with a frothy head.   Smell. Not my strong point, but lots of caramel, coffee, vanilla, sweet fruits and earthiness. Very nice.   Taste. A whole mouthful almost simultaneously; sweet malts up front to a smoky dry finish.  Feel. Full bodied, almost creamy, and sparkley.   Overall. A tad dry in the finish for me, but very small complaint, my newest favorite beer. Have one in the cellar, waiting for next year.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Bottled 15329, November 25, 2015.    Pours dark brown with ruby and orangish highlights. Frothy light tan one finger head. Retains pretty well.    Wet, used coffee grounds heavy in the nose at first and then recedes to smooth vanilla undertones. But this screams coffee out of the gates.    And the first sip does just that. A lot of medium roast coffee backed with some semi sweet chocolate and toffee. More sweetness as it warms up and releases some creamy vanilla flavors. Slight coffee bitterness rounds it out, but this is all coffee through and through. I was hoping for something else to develop more than it did, light the vanilla or cocoa or caramel or roastiness.    Lights side of medium body, low to medium carbonation. Not sticky, but maybe a light mouth coating. Fits the porter style vs. a coffee stout.    This is for coffee beer lovers. A lot of medium roasted coffee dominates. The vanilla does show up, but not nearly enough to stand up to the coffee. It's an excellent coffee porter for sure. Maybe too much coffee thigh for my liking.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 This beer has very strong characteristics, even for a novice like me its pretty easy to break down.    Pours black with tan head, aroma hits you as soon as the bottle opens. Coffee and vanilla, as advertised. Full bodied and feels great on the tongue, finishes smooth. Its a little sweet and I might not be finish the entire 6-pack tonight, but thats probably a good thing since its a very, very sneaky 10% abv.    Overall, this is a very sweet and enjoyable dessert type porter. I've had this over the course of a couple months now, and while the vanilla and coffee flavors hang around, they do degrade and start to leave somewhat of a metallic aftertaste.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.5 12oz bottle poured fairly aggressively into a pint glass.     Look: Black, mostly opaque. Vague crimson border when held to light. Fluffy caramel head, about 1.5 fingers. Outstanding head retention with moderate lacing.     Smell: Burnt barbecue, coffee, caramel, butterscotch, smoke. Not smelling much vanilla despite the name.    Taste: Roast and malt-forward. Coffee and caramel predominate. Vague indiscriminate sweetness on the back-end. Can't quite put my finger on it but, again, I wouldn't call it vanilla. Lingering bitterness reminds me of the charred bark on a brisket.    Feel: Low-moderate carbonation. A bit thin for what I look for in a porter. Wouldn't ever guess this was 10%; very well-hidden.    Overall: My first Ballast Point offering, and a great one at that. Would definitely revisit this regularly. Bought this as part of a make your own six pack and this may the best of the bunch.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Appearance - black in color, with a foamy brown head. Smell - mostly coffee and something else I can't put my finger on. Taste - blast of coffee with a subtle vanilla to smooth out the bitterness. Overall - this is good, can't wait to see as it warms a bit.
