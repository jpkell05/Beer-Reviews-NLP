look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I received this from @bum4ever in the NBS BIF 8.5. Bottled on 7/2/2018 and poured from a 375 ML cork and cage bottle into a tulip glass. The color is somewhere between ruby and orange and the ecru-colored head dissipated quickly. It has a very fragrant smell of ripe cherry, oak, red wine, and brett yeast. The taste is complex: tart cherry, pinot noir, oak, and a crackery malt at the finish. The flavors are all bold but they blend very well and there is a surprising balance of sweet and sour. It finishes with a touch of bitterness. This ale is a nice, full body with lively carbonation, and it's easily drinkable at 7.75% ABV. While I am not a connoisseur of Wild Ales, I have to say that Supplication is really delicious and fun to drink.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pours a reddish brown color with a thin foamy head. No head retention with mild to moderate lacing. Tart, smooth taste with cherries and mild red wine. Nice tart taste with cherries up front and red wine on the end. Smooth. Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Smell is tart and oaky with notes of cherries, red wine, grapefruit and orange rind.    Taste is tart and funky with notes of cherries, oak and citrus. Very subtle and balanced with a dry, almost coarse finish.    Mouthfeel is medium, with bright carbonation.    Overall, a really nice sour that is subtle and well made, but maybe not as exceptional as I had hoped.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours a beautiful slightly hazy deep reddish amber color with a 2 finger biscuit head. Aroma is dense with red whine and oak notes. Flavor is warm oak up front quickly turning to pinot noir notes. A rich sweet malt behind it blended with the lightly sour notes is very well done. Feel is lightly soft with a moderate effervescence. This is just stupendous. Perfectly balances in all regards.

After that it's all Beer vs Wine... lovely red wine notes throughout and its well sour. Cherry menthol and port--like warming alcohol without a burn. add in some nut flavours as well.  But  There is a complexity to this I haven't had before in any sour. The port notes and the smooth mouthfeel are soooo different.

S: Tart with aromas of cherries, pinot noir grapes, and vanilla. Lacto clearly present.   T: Tangy with flavors following the aromas fairly closely. Earthier, woodier, with an ?old leather note.   M: Substantive mouthfeel. Full bodied with beautifully persistent effervescence.  O: Despite consuming this very early, it presented very complex and mature flavor characteristics. Would love to be able to get this back home.

Smell: The first impression is a winy, sour aroma. It is followed by cherries and leather. There is also a bit of a barnyard impression.     Taste: There are flavors of cherries and leather with a moderate vinous quality. There are some wood like qualities to it. There are low levels of malt in the background. It has a very faint hint of smoke.     Feel: It has a moderately feel with some pleasant alcohol warming. It is quite sour to start, but does manage of dry finish.     Overall, it is quite complex in the nose and in the flavor with plenty of sour and brett qualities with the wine qualities. It work well together.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottled on: 01-25-18    Look - Mid-brown with a reddish hue. 1 finger head with pour from a 375ml bottle. Head dissipates - as expected with an aged sour. Stays active with some bubble streams for quite some time.    Smell - Hoped for a more pungent aroma. Cherry, vanilla, wood, almond, tobacco, hint of vinegar.     Taste - Tart up front - then you get some of the cherry, grape, and malt - somewhat sweet for a bit. Dries out / becomes quite sour quickly. Alcohol is not overpowering, but you know it is there. Flavors of red wine, charred wood, raspberry, and cherry all continue to swirl around the taste-buds. Very complex. As the fruit and sour notes fade, I was left with a surprisingly strong charred oak / grain aftertaste.     Feel - thinner side of a medium beer I would say. Not too thin but right where it needs to be. The bubbles subsided before I was half way through - slightly more carbonation would have been ok, but understandable with this style of beer.    Overall - This is an amazing beer. So complex with so many flavors to try to nail down. I took tiny sips throughout the entire drinking experience. This is well balanced in that it is quite sour but so much else going on that it isn't the only characteristic. I will buy this one again. Another amazing brew from RR.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 375 mL bottle into a wine since no tulip glass was available. The beer pours a light copper color with amber tint. Opacity is hazy, partially due to the chill, and partially due to a poor pour on my part – I likely stirred up the layer of spent-yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle during my far-too-vigorous pour. Carbonation is light in density, but heavy in quantity. 1-inch head dissipates very quickly, giving way to very lively bubbles in the center of the glass that persist throughout the tasting. First smell yields obvious fermented fruits; among them cherry, raspberry, and perhaps a bit of wild plum. Upon taking my first sip, I let the liquid wash over the entirety of my tongue to feel the light pricks of carbonation. The drying sourness is quite powerful. The flavor is similar to the nose, beginning with tart cherries leading to a warming sensation that blends well with a touch oak at the back of the tongue. As the flavor develops, I detect a slight malty sweetness that I didn’t notice on the nose. The oak and malt slowly mature into an earthy effervescence in the back of the mouth. This flavor is ephemeral, but the bubbly sensation continues to play at my tongue even long after the swallow.

My only knocks are the appearance does not do this beer justice and the abv is a little high to enjoy the complexity of this brew.

A dense and very flavorful sour ale with a bready brown ale base.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Taster at brewery. And I thought Consecration was the bomb. Wow! Not a sour guy, but this could turn me. Deep golden hue, soft foamy head. Aroma is soft and fruity. Taste brings the Brett, gently. Sweet and tart, like the candy. Hits it on all levels.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 First off, I don't like sours. I'm trying more to see if I can develop a taste for them and my eating is more a reflection of my personal taste than how this beer fits within the style. For the style this is one of favorite beers so far. I like it better than Consecration but it could be that I'm more used to the flavor profile after having Consecration yesterday. I find Supplication to be more balanced though and I like what the sour cherry ads to the flavor profile. It fits inside well and more satisfying to my palate. This beer is also less carbonated though that could be because it spent less time in the bottle. The medium carbonation is a better mouthfeel and let's the flavor longer longer.    Overall a good representation of the style and it's getting me one step closer to enjoying it more fully.

This heady brew has sharp scents of Pinot and cherries with a sweetness also pulling through on the nose. The flavor and feel of this beer are phenomenal. There are Pinot notes, cherries, sharpness and a perceived spice plus some funk all blended to perfection here. The feel is of a well done champagne with high carbonation and dryness. I’m blown away, I actually didn’t think I’d be this impressed with this awesome beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This was on tap at Apex and was a 2011 batch, served in a little flute-like glass. Poured a beautiful clear brownish red, no head whatsoever. Nose: fairly vinous, sour and fleshy cherries, a little vanilla, and here's something interesting, a bit of balsamic vinegar there, too. That's an interesting mix of flavors...and they carry through for its taste more or less exactly. Maybe a little more orchard fruit. The feel: carbonation is on the low side, body is middling, flavors are full and well-developed, but I'm not nearly as wowed as I was expecting to be, based on reputation and how much I've enjoyed other beers from these guys. For one thing, flavors just aren't very bright...it is pretty mellow. And the funk wasn't as funky as I thought it should be. I wonder if 7 years is a little too long for this one to sit. Hopefully I'll get a chance to try a younger one before too long.

L — Pours a ruby-hued, hazy dark amber body with a one-finger off-white head produced with moderate pour. Some retention and good lacing	  S — Cherry, oak, sour apple, musk, lemon, light floral, and caramel/toffee malts. Super nuanced	  T — Sour cherry, tart apple, pinot, oak, lime rind, lightly bready malts, cranberry, and raspberry. No bitterness to speak of  F — Lightly fluffy, not overbearingly sour, well-rounded… Not much to complain about here   O — Wowza. I can see how this is the flag-bearer of the style. Everything just works exactly right to create an elegant, complex, lively brew. I recently received two bottles of this in a trade, and I think I’ll let the other one sit for a couple of weeks to let it clear up a bit.   (cr)    EDIT (11.8.17): Tried the much more settled bottle and everything -- aroma, taste, and mouthfeel -- all became intensely clarified and nuanced. It's best at room temp    90/100

What a lovely combination... Very fine beer head with a fruity note of grape and plum. Taste is a bit of astringent, sour and tart like a red wine with cherry finish.

Pours a clear reddish brown with minimal head. Initial taste had a sour bite but then seemed to become slightly tart. Tart up front, getting the wine and barrel in the middle, getting some cherry on the end. Seems more carbonated in the mouth than in the glass. Then came a burp, exhaled slowly and really got the funky, yeasty flavor (maybe the best tasting burp I've ever had). Overall a wonderful first experience with a RR sour, I'd definitely drink this one again!   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 A total wow beer. Only got a little pour but it's amazing. Cloudy brownish orange color.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 WOW. This beer is absolutely incredible. Poured into a tulip glass. Bottled on 02/23/2016, 7.75% ABV. 12.68 oz bottle.    Look: Pours an opaque burnt crimson color, no head, quickly dissipating lace.  Smell: Dominated by oak and white grape, tart cherries, and peach. The woodiness is an amazing afterthought that is so crucial to the balance of aromas. The yeast even give it a slight hint of mold and grain.  Taste: So much going on here. Very tart, but with such strong notes of Pinot grapes. The subtle acidity finishes with strong oak barrel influences and a very subtle smokiness in the finish. Fruit notes of tart cherry and peach again evident in the taste.  Feel: Very dry body, seltzery and medium bodied. Although it has sweet characteristics, it is definitely a lip smacker.    An amazing experience. I've never had a sour so positively influenced by its containing barrel. You get notes of all the right things, and the yeast adds just enough chaos of funky tartness to perfect this beer's amazing profile. Get this bad boy while you can.    UPDATE: Still an amazing brew, but after having multiple different batches and many other similar sours, just amending the numbers a bit (2/23/18).

Tea brown in color with a slight fizziness. The aroma is almost boundless and full of funky notes of over ripened peach, white grape and plum with a base of spent grain, and damp straw. Tastes vinous with a nice mix of sweet and tart up front followed by more smooth, long tartness to finish. Has a medium tartness all the way through while notes of grain and wheat mingle with a touch of white grape juice, peach pith, cherry, other fruit peel and faint wood. Body is medium and goes down super dry.     Never overbearing, but never boring either. This one knows right where it needs to be, and for that reason it enjoys its place among the elites.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a cloudy amber with a little sediment, almost no head, some lacing and rising bubbles present.  Smell is very mild and pleasant, of warm ripe cherries, maybe some green apple and a little pear, some funkiness. I feel like I'm smelling a sweet fruity wine.  Taste is unexpectedly sour. When you get past that, you start noticing layers of fruit and funk and a nice little yeasty character, sour cherries and apple. Feel is medium bodied. After swallowing, what lingers is some sourness that fades and you notice a slight sweetness behind it. You get used to the sourness as you drink and it starts to feel more balanced.  I'm not a big fan of sour but there is something strangely compelling about this beer.

A properly decanted beer holds its off-white head a little better. Visible but limited streams of tinny bubbles eventually can't hold the impression, and the beer ends up mostly devoid of head.    The nose is classic upon initial impression - which comes quite quickly after the cork releases with a loud pop. There seems to be a fairly even balance of cherry tartness, red wine grape, and barrel woodiness.    The first sip hits me with more sour punch than I expected from the nose. Once that is accounted for, the beer "mellows" a tad, though it is still decently sour - which does take this to the next level over the Flanders styles that came from the nose. Despite limited exposure to my sight, the carbonation is definitely sensed via feel. It accentuates (or is accentuated by) the sour notes from the added yeast strains. This sourness has a cherry aspect to it, but overpower that flavor for the most part. The wine tannins along with the former barrel's resident come out by mid taste, more notable than the cherries. The cherries seem to make a little return in the lingering taste that otherwise has the yeast and barrel notes lingering.    The better decanted offering was a little more clean, but didn't seem to have too different a profile. There was just a little more "funk" from the beer that had a little cloud of the dregs into it.    I slowly appreciated this more as I drank it, though I had it rated fairly high initially. I really like the wine aspect of it, but wish the cherry was a little more evident on my palate. Having had Dissident last week, I feel this one is a little more sour, doesn't showcase the cherry nearly as much, but has an better feel to it. If the two weren't relatively difficult to obtain, I think it would be a fun side-by-side.

Pours beautiful out of the bottle - an amber hue with a thin head. Aroma is must, oak, overripe cherries and green apple. The taste follows right along in a cascade of sweet, sour, funky and woody. There's an impeccable dry crispness that zips to the back of my mouth and zaps my palate with a flanking attack. Wonderful feel, beautiful beer.

But bubbles leave even legs on the glass.  The smell and taste are of wine barrel and cherries. The sour cherries are on the forefront, with red wine and oak. Slight musk on the nose and a lovely tartness on the palate. Grape must. Incredibly crafted beer. A nice mouthfeel, well carbonated and not overly tart, dry.  Any time you get a Russian River beer it's a great occasion and I'm very glad to have​ enjoyed this.

It's an optimal sour with a great tart, yeasty bite. The ABV works overtime and you can definitely taste the strength of the booze. The flavor starts with tons of oak & dry pinot noir barrel flavor with cherry & apricot, and a surprisingly bitter finish, like a digestif. Does the Belgian tradition proud.

The nose was full of wine notes- cherries, pinot, oak, and vanilla. Also a bit of hay and funk. The taste showed the pinot and had a distinctive wine character, but was complex with Brett, hay, bread, and funk. Really enjoyable.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 The beer pours a nice white head that dissipates very quickly but leaves a nice ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself has a very nice wine look to it with it's nice medium brown amber that is clear. It's a really nice beer to look at and the texture has a nice slightly syrupy appearance. The look is pretty nice.    The smell and taste have similar notes but at different strengths that create different experiences. The smell is a bit more bitter with the brett notes and a light berry pinot noir note that creates a nice light balance between the two notes. The oak note is a bit light and the cherry adds a nice tartness, which unfortunately gets lost in the brett every once and a while. The taste has a stronger pinot noir note as well as the other notes except for the Brett, which is weaker. The Brett note is weak but shows up stronger in the end as well as a slight vinegar note.The wine notes along with the oak mix very well but the cherry tart seems to be even lighter.    The feel is pretty good. It has a nice medium body that has a nice heft to it with some nice tingling carbonation to it. The beer is pretty smooth.    Overall, this a very good beer and worth getting if you enjoy sours. It's a nice mixture of different notes that complement and contrast each other. If you can get it, go for it.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Batch 051115. Pours a beautiful ruby red with a fluffy off white head. The nose is sour cherries, funk and a touch of oak. The taste starts out nicely tart with loads of cherries, good wine notes and oak. There's a touch of sweetness in the middle, and it's nicely balanced between the sour and sweet. The finish is funky, sour and woody. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth without the typical bite I get from a lot of sours. The carbonation is spot on. This is something I could go back to repeatedly - if only I had the access.

A: Monstrous soapy foam head with a macro-bubbly topping, light tan coloring dominates the greater portion of the vessel with a leisure decline. Backlighting reveals a dark ice tea coloring with a bubbly sense of micro-carbonation. Lacing kept to a minimal.     S: Huge funky barn scent, animal feed, hay and sour fruit, cherries and musty wood. Good scent.     T: Smooth sour cherries, damp fruit and barn like funk. Feed grains, apple-plum esters like flavor. Light sour lemon fruit, cypress greenery, sour caramel and light herbal tea with a lightly acidic nature and acetic notes.     M: Silky smooth, no carbonation, medium-full density.     O: The flavor is very good, soothing sourness. Hard to go wrong with a Russian river, very eloquent, smooth, well blended complexity and transiition of flavor from start to finish. A bit $ at 16.50 per 12oz, but worth the experience one time. Barrel aged, and sure to impress.     4 3.75 4.5 4.25 4.25

Chalk up a new color. It's clear, and there's not much head.    The smell is floral, funky, and cherry. It's also medicinal, which isn't quite what I'm looking for.    Fortunately, the taste exceeds the smell (and it's usually the other way around). The cherries are more prominent, but I'm getting a lot of cinnamon for some reason. Oh, well. I'll just enjoy it. Hibiscus tea, plums, and currants, too. There's even a bit of chicory in there. The brett settles way down, letting other star flavors headline.    The feel is plenty carbonated, and maybe a little thinner than I'd like. In the aftertaste, the hibiscus and cherries fade a little, letting the brett back in.

Smells amazingly of Brett, sour cherries, barnyard funk, Cantillon Brewery-like woody cellar, and oak. It's all richly balanced and smooth on the nose.    Sour and perfect. Taste follows the nose, but all these nuances are so subtly displayed, without any obtrusive features. The smoothness of Pliny the Elder on the tongue, though a completely different beer altogether.     Light feeling body, highly carbonated to almost more than expected.    Got at Russian River Brewing Company in Santa Rosa, CA a few weeks ago. Drinking in New Hamburg, Ontario, October 10th, 2016. Been looking forward to this beer for a long time, and it doesn't disappoint.

I recognized the name, looked it up again online quick to confirm how highly rated it was, then went over and talked to the guy pouring. I couldn't believe they had a full keg of it, and the guy confirmed that it's pretty rare to see and there were no restrictions on how much I could drink. I sat by that keg for as long as possible, consumed at least ten beers worth since the guy picked up quickly and started pouring full glasses to save us both time and effort... and it was amazing. Easily the best beer fest experience of my life. This beer is the gold standard of sours, I couldn't imagine a better drinking experience. Sours are a genre of their own, so tread lightly if you haven't dabbled before... but if you are into the style, you can't get better than this IMO.

Dissipates to just a ring. No lacing. Looks like iced tea.     Smells of funk, cherries, oak, grapes and apples. A lot going on in the aroma with all the funkiness. Definitely smells like sour cherries though.     Taste of oak, sour cherries, apples, grapes from the Pinot Noir and some funk. Very balanced with all the flavors attacking. Very smooth. Taste like a sour alcoholic Shirley temple. Very nice.     The mouth is sour funk, with a solid amount of carbonation. Juicy finish.     I wasn't quite sure what to expect on this guy, but he was pretty good. Very well balanced. I'm not sure if I'd pay $16 for another bottle, but I would definetly drink this again with no hesitation.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Bottled 1/16/15. About 2 years old.    With a POP of the cork, this beauty pours out a pale blonde forming into what I can only describe as Cranberry Cocktail, or Strawberry puree mixed with a dash of prune juice. The head is diminutive and fleeting, leaving only bubbles on the upper deck. Opacity is darn near full moon, but leaves enough room for light to ignite the sides of the body in this tulip.    Perfumey notes of crisp cut apple, potpourri, bartletts, and cider.     Taste actually throws a huge curveball of vinegar first...quite different than what I was expecting. After a couple of seconds, this fades into some muted apples, dark berries, oak woodiness, and light fruit skins. Still, tannins and vinegar permeate the flavor profile profusely. It's almost as if fruit flies were to magically spew out from the glass. Very fermented. Ends with strong vinegar and wine notes.     A bit dry and tart on the feel, feeling a touch parched here, yet it still finshes rather wet.     Overall, SUPPLICATION was not the grand slam I thought it would be, but it could be due to the age (I was traded this bottle without prior knowledge of the age). I'd like to try this fresh, but definitely not at the $15-20 a bottle this normally goes for.

S - biggest notes are first tart cherry then a must in essence that reminds me of my grandpa's basement in a good way. Then more tartness, funk, barnyard, hay in the background. Some brown ale caramel and bready notes are peeking through the sourness. The MAIN thing with this beer is its a complex sour ale. It gives you more than just the sour.   T - same as the smell. Awesomness. See above.   M - medium mouthfeel. Initially feels like it should be light but once you start drinking it the sour/funky parts of it separate the boys from the men. Alc covered. Aftertaste is sour cherry.   O - RR sours are the best overall had. Maybe Cantillon is better but I wouldn't know. I've never had a domestic brewery that lived up to the home of Supplication and Sanctification.

Inspecting through light, the color almost has a copper-blood hue.     S: Heavy cherry and red wine character with a hint of cherry on the nose.     T: Rich sour barrel flavor with dark cherry and lacto funk. If you let the beer sit on your tongue, its brown ale base is much more apparent with lots of creamy malt. This makes it sing.     M: Lots of carbonation tartness with a decently creamy follow-through.     O: I may enjoy Consecration a bit more, but this is probably a higher quality beer with more elements waiting to be explored. Regardless, this is fantastic stuff.

This beer is really great, don't get me wrong, I just don't think it's worth me getting so excited about seeing it on a shelf. Happy to check this off the list though. Kind of a rotten aftertaste. Solid otherwise.    Sour Browns have seen better days, although from what I understand this beer has gone downhill a bit? That would make sense. Still great though and still worth the price even if it's no longer worth the hype.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Bottled 5/11/2015. Poured from a cork and cage into a snifter, the beer is a vibrant, slightly hazed, ruby-tinted brown coloring, with a thin film of off-white head on the surface, and a ton of carbonation flowing throughout the body. Aromas of tart and sour cherries, dark and sweet pinot notes, earthy undertones, hints of currants and berries, and a solid sour component throughout. Flavors are very sour and tart cherry forward, with a solid acidity and richly sweet backbone. That backbone has notes of cherry, chocolate, currants, and toffee, but it is only an accent character, as the tart and sour blend sweeps it up very quickly. Along with the cherry, your taste buds are overrun with tannins, horseblanket, lemon juice, dry and rich pinot characteristics, wood spice and char, tobacco, and an overall sour tone. Very dynamic and layered palate. The body is dry and crisp, with the increased carbonation cleaning up alongside the astringent sourness. The aftertaste is mostly cherry and wood, but with some earthy notes still lingering here and there. The finish is bone dry, with the sour pucker and acidity wringing every last drop of moisture out of your taste buds, leaving them begging for more. What a tremendous beer!

Taste is slightly sour cherries with oak, pinot grapes, and just a hint of fresh hay. Mouth is dry and lively. Overall, an exceptional sour beer, reminiscent of a fine wine.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours a deep tawny color with a large head. Cherry vanilla oak flavors up front with the pinot and caramel notes. Just enough balsamic vinegar taste to balance it out. Very complex   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Color of rooibos, that is, hues of amber red and brown working together, with some occasional bubbles and a thin ring of fizzy bubbles that dies to nothing. Supplication leaves wine-like legs on the glass, and even seems at times a bit hotter than the listed ABV would suggest.    Bright acidic cherries and light vinegar on the nose. A little blueberry even, as it warms. Woody and peppery notes really bloom and take center stage as it reaches room temp.    Cherry is nicely present without taking over. Too often, when cherry is on the label of a sour, it's either entirely absent, or it's overpowering. There is a nice balance in Supplication. A bitter and acetic sour element works well with the cherry, bringing much less a powerful vinegar-like presence than the nose hints at. A little supporting oak in the background.    A hefty tangy sting hits the tongue up front and tingles the back of the throat, but it goes down fairly dry.

AR: Lactic funk, oak, wine, cherries.  T: Follows nose, lots of oak on the finish, slight astrigency.  M: Medium carbonation, slightly prickly, medium body.    I love this beer, but I much prefer it on draft. Oak and wine really come out in the bottle. Draft is a little more tart and fruit forward w/out so much astringency.

Clear with a moderate off white foam head that hangs in pretty well for a sour. Aroma: Cherry is strong upfront, along with lactic acid, light toasted oak, and a distinct vinous note. Taste: Starts with a light sweetness with a touch of cherry, that quickly turns to a funky, earthy, puckering sour. Back end is distinctly vinous and acidic. Mouthfeel: Light body and moderate carbonation Finish: Very dry, with a lingering musty oak and cherry. Tart. Overall: A very unique sour in that the vinous quality of the Pinot noir barrel absolutely dominates the back end of this beer. This beer is puckeringly sour and tart, with a musty, funky quality. Leaves your mouth watering.

It gets a 84/100.

Ominous bubbles linger on the bottom of the glass as the tightly backed, velvety head subsides.     S - sour candy and rusted metal. A dark tart cherry with hints of raspberry and lime. Has an enticing, nostril-filling air about it that's hard to explain. Asserts itself with a strong and commanding present that is unrelenting.     T - artfully crafted. Exerts a potent acidic tartness filled with flavors of cherry, Brett, and oak. An elegant vinous character creeps through toward the third act and finishes strong. This beer knows what it wants and will accept no compromise. Pink grapefruit abounds and coats the mouth with a waxy, oily residue that slowly imparts increasing sourness as time passes. The hops duke it out with the sour in the most civilized way, to the point where you're rooting for both, reflecting on the good points each is making in this debate. It finally hits you that they're not really fighting, but cooperating, and the tingling sensation absorbs into your gums and tongue... marinating.     F - full-bodied and robust. Most sours are weak glass cannons, but this one has the backbone to stay strong!     O - I think I like this more than Consecration. Beautiful menagerie of flavor. Both forceful and classy. This is the kind of man I wish to be when I grow up.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a bottle into a Russian River tulip. Batch 100815.     Pours a beautiful ruby red, with a tiny off-white, bubbly head. Very nice retention and great lacing along the sides of the glass. Tart cherry, cranberry, and leather round out the aromas. Ripe dark cherry upfront and throughout, mellowed with a touch of oak. A lot of funkiness going on mixed in with wine characteristics from the pinot noir barrel. Very acidic, with a perfect amount of carbonation, and nice and refreshing. One of the better beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. World-class beer and a prime example of what other breweries should shoot for when brewing a wild ale.

Smell is bright sour cherry, some red wine, faint oak, and apple cider vinegar.    Taste is much like the aroma--lots of tart cherry and cranberry, but not overwhelmingly so. Nice notes of oak and leather. The acidity is certainly there, but well balanced with the sour flavors. Body is on the light side of medium with crisp, lively carbonation that seems perfectly suited to the rest of the beer.    Despite limited experience with wild ales and sours in general, I know delicious when I taste it. Very refreshing. Would love to have this paired with some proper food.

Aroma drops plenty of cherry, American oak, good tart and sweet thing going at the same time.    Taste is astringent oak, tart cherries, a gritty brett like contribution as they age. Earthy, sweet and sour at the same time. Alcohol extremely well hidden. Whether on tap, in the bottle, vintaged out or fresh, this is always a world class beer.

Rather faint, malty aroma with that wild, brett-like quality; cherry and blackberry scent. Tart, sour cherry flavor; acidic. Very sharp, earthy bite; fine fizziness; tangy; dry.    Hmm. Overall, a fine, mouth-twisting tang and sourness to this beer. It comes across with a hard, biting crispness but with a decidedly soft and airy mouthfeel. The cherry twang is front and center, and the appearance is dynamite. I can't really say there is much brown ale maltiness left with this other than the color, yet the overall taste (considering its a wild ale) still is outstanding. Well, this is an awesome beer in all it's quirky, awesome glory...

Smells like sour cherry, light leathery funk, some white wine, a bit of oak, and some lemony tartness.    This was the first sour I ever had, and I thought it was terrible. I didn't really understand sours. But now, having this again, a few years later, I can see how great it is. It's got a great sour macerated cherry flavor, a bit of oaky bitterness, some leathery funk, and a nice sharp acidity. The base brown ale is fairly present still, with some breadiness, and a little bit of sweetness. This is awesome.    This is medium bodied, with a juicy and tart mouthfeel, and a higher level of carbonation.    One of the best and most classic fruited sours out there. Near perfection.

Moderate head subsides rather quickly, some lacing.     Nose is bracing and extremely pleasant -- wine, vinegar, and cherry are all prominent. Palate follows, with tartness straddling the line between inadequately and overly sour for my tastes. Apple cider vinegar, sour cherry, but also some subtle but very useful sweetness/caramel. This beer is not one dimensionally sour and fruit forward like some of this style, and this dimension really makes the beer sing. Finish is long and delicious.     So damn good. One of the best beers I've had in a long time.

Definitely could taste the cherries, pinot noir and oak - Since this was my first time trying this I expected this to be super sour and tart, but it was perfectly balanced and not overbearingly sour. Definitely will have to get more of RR's beers!

Cranberries, cherries    Crisp taste, sour without being overpowering. The wine barrels have mellowed it, and imparted a smoothness you don't normally find..not harsh at all. Berries, a bit of rose wine.    Dances on the tongue. Light without being heavily carbonated

Moderately strong barrel character, one of the oakier sours I've had and accurately reflects the time some of these blends spent in wood. Cherry taste is more earthy than sweet/tart. Very restrained sourness to the beer, can see why this is so popular as it serves as a great intro to the sour style. I like them a little more aggressive than this but it's easy to see how this beer has stood the test of time.

Great medium body with a vinegar back end - just what I'm looking for in a sour beer.

Pours a hazy red/purple, and you can smell the tart right out of the bottle. The wine barrel aging really rounds this beer out and gives it a great depth of flavor. Sour cherries and strawberry notes with just a bit of funk

Attractive amber-range pour with modest head. Some red hues in the light.    Big aroma of wine, grapes, cherries, and wild yeast. A hint of spice.    Medium to full body,.    The taste is tart and sour but not overwhelming. Decent toasted malts in the mix. A peppery note. This is a wild ale that I could drink often.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 My favorite of the Russian River wile ales. It is a cherry sour done right! The nose and taste are cherries and tart cherries. It is tart, but not too tart. Brett, but not too brett.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Huge barrel character. Oak and char with some vanilla and wine character. Vinegar, brett, and big cherry notes. Finishes dry and clean. Drinks smooth. Mouth feel is only medium, but the huge barrel character makes this feel like a bigger beer. Excellent sour. Very much worth what it takes to trade for this.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Good sour beer, the cherries come through well but the acidity was a tad over for me, shared a bottle and struggled a bit with the excess sourness. It's a very well made beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.25 Pours a dark copper color. Not much off white head.   Smell is cherries, oak, slightly acidic, brett funk and leather/band aidy phenols.  Flavor is strong tart cherry up front, some funk and oak on the back end. Finishes medium dry with some alcoholic sweetness.  Very thin and a bit fizzy. Disappointing in this regard.  Feel is a big letdown, but still an enjoyable wild ale.

Smells tart, lemon juice, lime, red wine, cherry, and a lot of funk. Taste is red wine and cherry up front, crisp at first, followed by a super tart finish. A good amount of carbonation in here, and so very well balanced. This is just great. One of the best sours on the market. Bottle dated Jan/2014

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Look - Redish/amber color without much head or lacing    Smell - Oaky to the max with cherries, malt, and yeast    Taste - Medium tartness/sourness with an oaky cherry taste that has a distinct dryness due to the Pinot Noir barrels. Slightly funky. The brown ale base beer gives this a mellowing dark malt presence and enhances the sour and fruit aspects of this beer.    Feel - Light mouthfeel, which combined with the light carbonation makes for a smooth sip (or gulp).    Overall - Not necessarily worthy of the hype it generates, but it is still an excellent wild ale at a price that doesn't stress my wallet... an easy buy for those who like sours and have access to this beer.

Aroma of cherry, oak, lactic acid, green apple, Pinot Noir... flavor follows the aroma with tart raspberry, cranberry, vanilla, citrus, slight lambic-like funk, Pinot, and tannins from both the barrels and dried cherry skins ..complex, balanced and absolutely wonderful. The feel is light and spot on for the style. Sparkling carbonation. Overall, a spectacular beer.     12/2014 Vintage reviewed on 3/13/16:   Pours an amber/copper with small off white head. Aroma of green apple, oak, funk, slight wine barrel, slight malt. Flavor follows the aroma with hints of cherry and a slightly different "twang than the other bottle reviewed that was 1 yr younger(fresh). The year of age has affected the color and flavor of this beer tremendously. I get much less of a red color, and much more funk and acetic notes than the fresh bottle. It is neither good nor bad comparing, just different. Very pleasing. More vinous. Carbonation is slightly higher but not tremendously.

Mouthfeel is crisp like a champagne but with a bit of chewyness. Overall a great sour ale. I wouldn't say one of the best but it's damn tasty.

Taste is a sucker-punch of sour -- sharp, swift funk. The pinot and cherries maybe slightly less apparent in the bottle from one year ago. The sourness and funk from the brett really caught me off guard. Tingly mouth feel. This Russian River blows Pliny out of the water (but it's apples to oranges anyway, right?) Fully lived up to all the hype. Looking forward to trying some more of this at different vintages.

The color is that of a cherry/amber with minimal head and lacing. The smell is of cherries and oak; somewhat funky. The taste is delicious and had lambic/gueze-like characteristics to it. It is a shame that this bottle is so small as I could drink a few of these in one sitting. Super delicious and worth seeking for in my opinion! Cheers!

LOOK: Pours with a finger's worth of off-white foam that halves itself after one minute. Rising bubbles are small in size and high in quantity. Amber in color with a moderate amount of cloudiness. Lacing is high, thick, and remains on the glass.  SMELL: Has strong aromas of sour yeast and oak that combine with mild aromas of earthy yeast, red wine, leather, and hints of hay. The bottle says it has cherries added to it, but no cherry aromas can be detected.  TASTE: Initial taste is of very strong sour yeast and strong red wine flavors. Strong oak flavors immediately follow as red wine flavors fade to mild. As all flavors persist, subtle hay and hints of red cherries enter (there they are, barely).  FEEL: Medium-bodied and highly carbonated. Goes down rough and finishes with a surpsingly subtle dryness, given how sour it is. And yes, the sourness agressively plays with the tongue.  NOTE: This was an amazing American Wild Ale, but Atrial Rubicite still takes the top place.

The taste is tart at first, and then a sour dark fruit takes over that leads to a finish of oak goodness. You can really taste the age on this. The pinot wine is their and the barrel shines. I guess this is why this is a world class beer you can actually taste the care that was taken in this beer.

Orange and passion fruit.     T - Very sour cherry with just a little bit of sweetness and a little bit of bitterness at the end.    M - Medium body without a lot of burn.    O - This is a strange one for me. A very sour beer with an apple cider vinegar aftertaste. Not my preferred choice, but interesting.

Nose brings on the pinot and cherries, but its mellow and complimentary to the brett and lacto. The flavor follows suit - funky and perfectly sour - incredibly well balanced, which I think comes from the oak aging on this one. Thrilled I had an opportunity to have this. It was awesome.

Poured into the glass it more of a sour/vinegar brow ale smell. Taste was actually kind of bitter, some pinot noir and cherry but not sour at all. Well crafted but not a big fan of the flavor.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottled 062212, this is an old one. Figured it would be a good 1000th review.    Pours orangey copper with pink glints. The fizzy head lasts about 20 seconds before disappearing and not leaving much lace on the glass. Gorgeous cherry and oak notes mingling with some funk in the nose. Cherry, raspberry, lemon, irony oak notes, horse blanket, tropical fruit and bready malt. The finish is super dry and fruity, lasting a good while. The mouthfeel is full of carbonation, not as prickly as champagne but very active.    This is a fantastic Wild Ale. Deservedly a benchmark of the style. So complex and juicy, and it holds up to age fantastically. A must try for anyone.

Flavors from the cherries, Pinot Noir and barrel complement each other well. I know there are plenty of fantastic sours out there and but the standard by which they are still measured are those from Russian River.

It looks ok so long as no yeast gets into the pour. Smell is typical, nothing over the normal. This beer however excels in taste and feel which is what really matters. This things rocks! It feels amazingly smooth and does not do what other sours do.

She did shudder after drinking it though.  I loved it. Perfect tartness and the perfect level of funk. Great feel for a sour. I opened it last night after my nephew scored me another bottle from the brewery (along with several others)! Not sure if I should age it longer or not?  This was bottled in early January of 2015, so it was almost 8 months old. It sure hit the spot for me. Hard to imagine it being better.

S: Tart, dark fruit, cherry, some oak and wine character from the barrels, and a hint of alcohol.     T: Quite tart, sour cherry, a faint almost raspberry like something in there, nice oak character and touch of wine from the barrels, a little funk, and the slightest bit of sweetness on the finish.    M: Medium body, moderate but prickly carbonation.     O: Very well done, and properly sour.

Not as sweet as the flemish sours and definitely more tart. Highly recommend if you can get your hands on it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Aroma features a fair amount of lactic funk (leather, sandalwood) with a little bit of sour grape must. Pringly carbonation and mouthfeel. The lactose carries over but it isn't ultra-vinegary. You can definitely pick up the pinot noir flavors, but I couldn't find the Brett much on my pallete. Lots of sour grape must, a little cherry and hibiscus as well. There is a pointed oak note on the end from the barrel aging, and it is a tad too bitter on the linger for me. Overall a great sour but not some mythological perfection.

A: Sour tart funkiness, cherries, picking up some oak, white grapes, smells really good.    T: Sourness, cherries, oak, white grapes, finishes funky with more oak and dry.     M: Medium body mouthfeel, less carbonated than it looks.    O: My first sour I had about a year ago and did not like it, I think I had to explore the style first. This is really good, complex, I don't remember getting as much oak but it is well balanced with cherries and the other sour characteristics.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a 375ml bottle into a Spiegelau tulip. Bottled on 1/16/15 printed on label.    Appearance: Pours an opaque copper-orange with a 1/2 finger bubbly snow white head which dissipates quickly. Minimal lacing.    Smell: Oak barrel and cherries dominate with a touch of barnyard funk and vinegar. There is a hint of sweetness that balances out the sour aroma. Smells amazing.    Taste: The oak characteristic from the barrel is dominant up front with a blast of sour cherries and lacto sourness in the middle before ending with tannic dryness that leaves a very mildly sour and oaky finish. Overall, the flavor is a bit abrasive and not as balanced as I would have liked.    Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation.     Drinkability: Decent drinkability. This is a one and done beer for me.    Overall: Very good beer overall. The aroma is by far its best characteristic as it smells truly great. I would definitely recommend trying this beer, but I think it's a bit overrated.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Split with a buddy, so poured into Stone Sourfest taster glass.    Pours a hazy, darker amber with a mild head and some delicious cherry and sour funk notes emanating out. Goes down incredibly smooth and not too bitter at all on the back-end. The cherry flavors are a highlight and provide a very different takeaway than most sours. There's a reason this one's so well regarded.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 pours an inviting amber-mahogany color. The most sophisticated description of smell that I could initially muster was: sour. After giving the beer a minute to breathe, though, it reveals fragrances of cherry and cranberry that then give way to scents of green apple and lime. Taking the first sip is an experience unto itself. While the nose gives you every indication that you should expect a Martinelli’s Sparkling Apple-Cranberry concoction, the sour profile puts your tongue in a chokehold. This aggressive taste eventually does mellow and reveal an oaky red wine flavor. Tannins are present and add to the tartness of the sour cherries. Overall, this beer is one of the pinnacle sours available today. And beyond all else, you have to love the fact that the carbonation bubbles – like the old man in Up – continue their journey through the very last sip. (1,510 characters)   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Pours a slightly hazy amber with a thin head that fades entirely pretty quickly.    Nose is funk forward, tinge of sour and vinegar with some bright over ripe fruit, definitely cherries on the top.    Flavor is exactly as expected except maybe even more sour than expected. Definitely a solid funk here and a really bright and bitter component along with the sour. The oak adds a nice depth of character and the body feels more well rounded for it. Really awesome sour here, a real treat.

My bottum line as with most sours.They would be awesome if they were cheaper... I don't find the value in them. That said, this brew is unique and packed with complexity through and through~

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 10 oz pour during San Jose beer week.   I was at RR last week and had Consecration, and I'll preface this review by saying I enjoyed that beer more. Supplication has a very nice bright nose that is fruit-forward, sour,and followed by some in ce brett funk. The taste loses most of the fruit and is extremely vinous. The finish is like licking the side of a wine barrel. Very interesting, but a bit odd with such a disconnect between the nose and taste. I also found myself seaching for those cherries to no avail. Overall, a pretty good beer, but not as balanced as some other RR sours.
