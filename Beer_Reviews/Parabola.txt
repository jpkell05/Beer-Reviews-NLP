S - bourbon, molasses, coffee, vanilla   T - follows the nose. Great dark sugar sweetness with mild bitterness and bourbon and roasted quality. Ideally would want a stronger bitterness in a RIS. Great for such a high avb stout   F - nice creaminess, with low carb. A little light for the style   O - a great RIS with fantastic dark sugar and barrel quality.

S: Chocolate, espesso, vanilla, and roast.    T/F: Follows the nose . Rich roasted flavor... vanilla and booze mixed with tobacco, leather, and dark chocolate. Some dark fruit mixed in... the bourbon is still present but not overpowering. Smooth and creamy. Complex and warming. Hits like a velvet covered hammer.    O: An elite stout... and still wonderful after 9 years in the cellar. The flavors have probably mellowed a bit but this is a wonderful beer. Looking forward to trying some more recent incarnations.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours a pitch black coloration with a medium, creamy head. Smells intoxicating of roasted, caramel malt and rich bourbon, chocolate and dark fruit notes, with hints of vanilla and oak. Taste follows the nose, with a fantastic balance of roasted, caramel malt, dark/milk chocolate, dark fruits: fig, plum, raisins, and a rich bourbon notes of toffee, vanilla and oak, as well as just a hint of licorice, tobacco and herbal hops. Finishes with a medium bitterness and rich bourbon notes lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a very rich body and low/medium carbonation. An exceptional BBA stout that is both complex and incredibly well-balanced, with a perfect Bourbon note to it that is rich and intense, but not overbearing (as in BCBS Rare), as well as a certain bitter, roasted character that acts as perfect counterpoint to the sweeter notes of caramel/toffee and dark fruits, the latter really standing out here in a very nice way. The only thing I might say is that it's still just a tiny tad too sweet for my personal taste and that the mouthfeel, which is great, could still be richer.

This exceeded my expectations! There are a lot of highly rated BA stouts out there, and in my opinion, they're not ALL great beers, as many lack good balance.     This parabola was perfectly balanced, with a great thick, rich mouthfeel and proper sweetness to match the ABV. Also a good nose from the barrel aging.    Superb beer.

Headless but full. Thick and smells wonderful.    Dislikes: Positively the stickiest stout I’ve dealt with. Tad bit uncomfortable. A very slightly bitter aftertaste.     Overall, fantastic. Would buy again and again.

This is at the top of the heap. Refiinement and balance is more important to me than flavor bombardment.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2016 Vintage    Look - pitch black; rough pour yielded minimal head  Smell - TONS of barrel .. a pleasing aroma of bourbon-soaked wood  Taste - nice punch of bourbon and dark fruit (raisins, etc) ... very balanced overall - Roasty qualities come out as the beer warms.  Feel - ABV is well hidden and never becomes syrupy or cloying, which was a nice surprise.     this aged very well and I'm glad I got to try it. Love the FW vintage releases!

Delicious stouts are on tap everywhere it seems! Poured chilled to a tall snifter. Another delicious elixir. No real head from the pour, but a tiny tan ring with lots of legs. Nose all bourbon, with a lot of smokiness and caramel. First sips follow on point, with a hint of vanilla. The smokiness is very prominent, like the Stone Old Guardian Barleywine. Mouthfeel is crisp but full and lingering. Alcohol is just present enough to let you know it’s around, but never gets in the way up front. Really, FW offerings that come bottled in a box are the shi....shhh don’t tell anyone you found some, or they’ll bogart your supply chain!

Cola and a hint of licorice. Sweet berries and loads of dark caramel. A hint of leather. Super-rich smelling beer    T: sticky dark caramel and huge roasted malt. A mix of dark and milk chocolate. Sweet cola and a hint of oak. It’s a huge beer, yet very smooth, and no real hint of alcohol which is impressive given the abv     M: heavy, sticky mouthfeel with low carbonation    O: fantastic stout. Big sipper that would be best shared

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This is a very good beer. It's different from many of the other barrel-aged stouts that I'm used to having, given that Russian Imperial Stouts taste very fruity relative to other imperial stout styles (e.g., American Double Stouts). Here goes:    A: Pitch black. Develops a slow-to-build head that leaves a ton of lacing. Looks exquisite.    S: Lots of oaky vanilla from the barrel aging, but not as prominent as in other barrel-aged stouts (e.g. Goose Island). Also very fruity - lots of dark fruit like plum and raisins. Interesting, just wish the barrel-aging was more prominent.    T: Great oaky vanilla notes - more prominent in the taste than in the scent. Also a lot of dark fruit; the aftertaste is one of plum and raisins. Interestingly, there's no coffee bitterness at the back end of the palate.    F: No alcoholic booziness; very smooth. Great.    O: A very good beer. I go prefer Goose Island to this, but this is still an excellent brew.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Bottled on 1/16/17    Pours a deep black with only a hint of light at the surface; barely a half-finger of sand-colored cap forms, only to fade quickly and leave thick, somewhat bubbly foam around the edges.    Aroma excellently intermingles vanilla and dark berries, along with some oak, baker’s chocolate, cranberry, and faint bits of barrel; a light florality also places a light veil of rose petal tones around the bouquet.    Taste welcomes darker chocolate notes to the forefront, balanced cleanly alongside gritty oak barrel, vanilla bean, raisin, and wild berry must; the berry notes evolve in the profile, while a dusting of chocolate gives the fresh, juicy tones an earthy, slightly bitter twist.     Mouthfeel brings an effortlessly balanced body with smooth, almost indiscernible carbonation; slick, with some residual stickiness that just glides along the palate; the massive ABV is completely invisible; so incredibly well-done here.    Beautifully crafted sipper, and a great standard for a top-tier Russian Imperial stout; everything is so smooth, with some great detail to the profile and bursting with refined flavor.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Very nice, smooth, rich sipper of an imperial stout. Very nice deep rich, almost black color with minimal head or lacing. Smells of toffee, raisin, malt, some roast coffee and dark chocolate. Tastes similarly, along with molasses, wood, bourbon and brown sugar. Very smooth, thick mouthfeel with little carbonation. Syrupy and lots of warming heat. Can definitely taste the high ABV. A very good beer, just not sure if it’s worth the high price tag.

Found a 2018 bottle in a box on the shelf. Pour is black, low head, great lacing, rich body.   Smell is dark fruit, dark chocolate plum and bourbon barrel.   Taste is full and has vanilla hints, roasted cocoa, creamy bourbon notes, coffee & molasses, very nice stuff. Everything you want in a BA Stout.   Feel is full, sticky, low carbonation.   Like others mention, there’s a tootsie roll aspect to the sweet notes. Just a hint of black licorice at the end burn. It nicely compliments the bourbon barrel flavors (and everything else). Outstanding and about as good as I was hoping.

Head holds at a cap covering 7/8ths of the beer...light lacing.  Roasted malts and still plenty of booze 4 years on it. Strong chicory coffee, a creamy tone.  Rich malts, chocolate...caramel, coconut, cream, mellow roast. Delicious.  Amazing silky mouthfeel...velvet. The heat has subsided. LOOONG finish full of roasty malts and booze.

Dark chocolate, vanilla, sharp booziness.  Big boozy flavor and still hot at 14.5%, chewy fudge, coconut, dark fruit. Tootsie Roll. Wood and barrel age are the show here.  Woo-hoo big beer, lots of long lasting heat and warmth. Not quite full bodied, I'm going medium bodied but velvety smooth with low carbonation.  Enjoyed this, would be a good one to share even at 12oz.  Rated 4

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25 Served in a concaved pint glass.     Appeance: Thin black body with a tan head which doesn't have much body to it. Could use a touch tweaking considering a little more density but the brew looks good. Tan head which rose initially about a notch or so below a finger's length. Almost no stickiness to the glass which is a plus.     Smell: Molasses scent with hard dose of espresso. In and out the nostril but very addicting aroma.     Taste: Sweet and bitter coffee, actually more like espresso and hard hit of love. My palate is all over the place with this beer and the brown sugar isn't helping. Malty, sweet but still bitter. Complex lust if that defined the taste to you.     Mouth: It might comes off a touch dry but this beer is sticky and well finished. Full bodied and the flavors just hug your cheeks. Superb.     Overall: Second time I had this beer and granted I was allowed to take as many as I wanted I grabbed an additional four more. I will let age with time considering the space I have but good brew. Maybe not the best barrel aged imperial stout but one that will leave a memory on your palates. Salud!

Only fault is I would like some more bitterness to balance it out.    Overall a fantastic RIS! Glad I tried it. Would be worth keeping a bottle for a year or two...

Aroma is bourbon,but not a heavy boozy bourbon. Roasted malt, milk chocolate,and a little dark chocolate and coffee.  Taste was awesome,all the flavors I described but not one was extremely forward. Really smooth and way to easy to get down despite abv. This is one that's worth the hype

Smell: Awesome smell of molasses and bourbon.  Taste: Complex mixture of molasses, vanilla and bourbon. The extremely high alcohol content is definitely noticable, but this this beer is still extremely smooth going down in spite of its ABV of 12.7%. This is not a beer that you'd want to drink quickly.  Mouthfeel: Minimal carbonation, full bodied beer that is very smooth.  Overall: It is definitely not difficult to understand why this is considered a world class beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 2018 batch. Pours a deep chocolate fudge color with minimal head. Nose is chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, and fig. Palate is caramel, fig, chocolate fudge, and roasted malt, with some rye spice, plum, and a smidge of coconut emerging. Not bad, but a little more body and sludginess would do it wonders. I’ve been blending last year’s version into other, heavier stouts that I feel would do better with these flavors, and will likely do the same with this year’s.

Look: dark brown almost black with a half inch fluffy mocca colored head    Aroma: bourbon, roasted malts, caramel    Taste: The flavor is roasted malts, caramel, dark fruit/figs, it is sweet and with significant bourbon, milk chocolate and vanilla, maybe some coffee.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Been looking forward to running into this for a few years now. Not disappointed whatsoever. This is hands down the best RIS I have had that did not include coffee as an ingredient. Just had a Sucaba, and I thought it could have used a little more bitterness of some sort, preferably roastiness. That is exactly what this beer delivers: an almost identical, but darker version of their barleywine.    L: Claims an srm of 99.0? Didn't think that was possible for a beer. Looks somewhere between 36-39 to me; a good source of light can penetrate through about an inch of liquid. Barely any head. Very low carbonation.    S: Divine. Molasses and dried dark fruits (mostly cherry and plum) are first again, with bourbon, vanilla and coconut filling out the middle and hints of leather and tobacco before a chocolate syrup and buttery toffee finish that has a satisfying charred oak note to cap it off.    T: Upon sipping, I find it uncanny how similar this is to Sucaba. It is literally the same beer with more bourbon barrel and more charcoal: which makes it a slightly better beer. I could still imagine this style done better. Molasses is too prominent in it, for my taste.    F: That little bit of extra bitter on the finish makes all the difference when sipping. I do not find this one at all cloying, while I thought the Sucaba was a touch too syrupy in the balance.    O: A fantastic Imperial Stout from a recipe that is tried and true. Hey guys, wanna try adding some coffee??

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 I've had this beer a few times (as well as I think four of the Anniversary blends which typically have a decent amount of Parabola to their individual lineages), but don't seem to have ever reviewed it. Now that it's available in single 12 oz bottles, I can crack one and give it a review without having to split it with anyone else! Hallelujah!    Parabola pours a very dark color but it stops fairly short of being pitch-black. A deep brown color holding up a rather small and demure head of khaki foam, this brew is stately in my glass and doesn't delve into the depths of insanity that some other big stouts tend to. It just looks the part quite well and doesn't initially scare me off, in other words. There are some small islands of suds on the surface, but overall this is just a remarkably clear and straightforward imperial stout pour.    I allowed this about 5 minutes to open up once poured into my glass, and I'm glad I did. I noticed a slight bit of metallic-ness right away, but it peters out quickly, revealing layers of rich coconut, tannic bourbon whiskey elements, intense roast character, charred dark fruits (plum, specifically) and a bit of ethanol heat. A little bit of interesting, rye-like spice here as well, which I find to be pretty characterful but which I can also see not being up every drinker's alley. Some brandy and/or rum-like molasses/brown sugar coming across as it warms to the 55F serving temperature suggested on the bottle. Very complex and deep.    Raisin, brown bread, roasted malts, prune and plum fruitiness melding with some coffee-like elements and oak woodiness. Tannins are surprisingly not as stiff as expected here; this is very smooth with a lot of fruitiness and dark chocolate coming together really well. Balanced as hell, with an earthy hop bite toward the finish of each sip, as well as more coconut, light vanilla and layers of whiskey sweetness from the barrel aging. I don't think this is the best-tasting BA stout I've ever had, honestly, but it is probably one of the most complex considering it doesn't use any adjunct ingredients. There's just a little too much fruitiness and esters from the English ale yeast for me. However, I do really like it. A pure, bold and excellently-sipping BBA imperial stout.    The feel is silky smooth, as expected. There's very little carbonation to this one; it almost comes across as a few steps removed from being a cask ale in that sense. The finish has a little heat, but it's really well-tempered for being close to 13% ABV. I can see very little reason to age this one to any real extent, as opposed to the bottle of Bravo I had last year that was really hot right off the bat. This is just about as drinkable as FW's other most well-loved BA beer, Sucaba. Hope to find a few more bottles of this, but I might be too late.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Sampling a cellar temp 2017 bottle poured into a snifter. The beer pours a light chocolate brown color with a khaki colored head of 2 cm. The foam is dense and fades slowly to an edge layer. The beer is not as dark of a pour as I expected from the beer. THe aroma is roasted malt a bit of dark chocolate mixed with some molasses and no hints of any hops. The beer is a little boozy and some black pepper notes poke through to make me know this is a sipper beer.  First sip reveals lots of dark malt and chocolate with molasses and bourbon. NO hops show through and the alcohol is noticeable on each swallow. Takes a bit to finish the bottle, but it is enjoyable . The texture is very smooth and carbonation is almost nonexistant.   This is a nice robust imperial stout and certainly worth a shot, but it does pack a bit of a kick as I am certainly feeling it by the end of the bottle.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a 12oz 2018 Vintage No. 009 bottle into a tulip glass.     Pour: deep, rich black with no light penetrating. One finger, tan head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring. No lacing; somewhat surprising relative to other big rich BA stouts. This is a good looking beer but not exceptional.     Nose: bourbon, vanilla, caramel, dark fruit sweetness are all readily apparent. Not overwhelming but really nicely balanced. Could smell this all night long.     Taste - sweet bourbon, vanilla bean, caramel, dark cherries, brandied fruit, brown sugar, and dark chocolate all work together beautifully. Finishes with a slight dark chocolate, hops bitterness. This is a symphony of well balanced flavors. One of the best.     Mouthfeel: smooth, milkshake like viscosity. Moderate carbonation. This coats the tongue, but finishes fairly clean. Really outstanding.     Overall: this is one of the best BBA stouts I’ve tried. More balanced than KBS, at least on par with Black Note and Bourbon County. Along with Bourbon Paradise, an ATF.     One left in the cellar. Look forward to trying it in a year or so.

Smell:  2017: massive aromas of barrel, chocolate, coffee, anise?, boozy, caramel, tobacco, old leather.  2018: Not as big of an aroma here. Has that same boozy aroma; lots of fresh bourbon barrel, blackstrap molasses, but missing many of the other aromas listed above, except that interesting anise smell - bordering on eucalyptus / menthol.    Taste:  2017: big and boozy, lots of bourbon barrel flavor, loads of cocoa, tons of coffee, ample molasses and caramel Towards the end. Sweet but an espresso bitterness on the finish cuts the sweetness short.  2018: incredibly sweet, borderline cloying. Lots of roasted malts, sweetness has a marshmallow quality to it. Brown sugar, dark corn syrup. A lot of the above flavors are masked by the sweetness. Has a similar bitter espresso finish.    Feel:   2017: fairly thick and syrupy, light carbonation.  2018: I was expecting the younger version to be a lot thicker and more full-bodied, but this is not the case here. Slick and syrupy, a little oily, a little creamy.    Overall:  2017: very smooth, abv is very noticeable but doesn't get in the way of all the complex flavors. I am looking forward to drinking this vintage in another year.    2018: I am surprised that the beer with a lower abv is sweeter, but it may be due to its relative freshness. I am curious to see what a year of aging does to it. I have several bottles of each vintage...    5/22/18  12 oz bottle   2017: 14.5% abv  2018: 12.7% abv  I enjoyed the 2017 vintage the best  4.75 rating

Appearance- a deep black that only lets a hint of light at the bottom of the snifter and along the top of the beer where some carbonation bubbles are seen; no head and lacing is nowhere to be found.  Smell- bourbon, vanilla, caramel and black licorice mesh to form a mouth watering blend!  Taste - delicious bouquet of bourbon, vanilla bean, dark cherries, dark chocolate and caramel candy working seamlessly to put my palate in a trance!  Feel - the immensely flavorful blend and mild sweetness take any edge off what the 12.7% booze might otherwise present and makes this an incredibly easy sipper!  Overall- Parabola has eluded me for far too long, but certainly worth the wait; this is supremely crafted as I find myself emmerced in the dance between bourbon, vanilla, caramel and dark chocolate covered black cherries!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Big thick, foamy beige head that draws back to an even curtain of lacing.

Taste is simply terrific, with equal sized waves of rich coffee, vanilla and bourbon with a molasses finish dressed in a thick, silky body. Aftertaste is a sweet, maybe a finish similar to how it feels after drinking bourbon.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.   Pours out very dark brown. And once the glass is filled, it looks black with brown highlights. A thin but dense tan colored crown sits on top.   The smell is bourbon first, then a lot of dark fruit, vanilla and oak.   The taste is chocolately with the bourbon and vanilla. More chocolate than I expected. The oak and barrel qualities are nice.   The mouthfeel is warming from the bourbon. This doesn't really seem "full bodied" for a Russian imperial stout. It's not thin, just thinner than expected for the style.   Overall, it delivered on being solid and balanced, but not gonna lie I did expect more from this.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Poured into a Spieglau stout glass, 1" khaki foam head which quickly dissipated,very little lacing. Looks deep dark mahogany red. Smells of chocolate,berries,burnt vanilla,must,oak. Taste is similar with a berry/cacao going on.Feels pleasant almost dry, well carbonated finish. Booze is evident (not a 14% as the header says) my 2018 vintage says 12.7%. These Firestone Walker vintage editions are all world class in my opinion. These are 10$ a bottle. Boxed individually. Overall I wish I could buy them all without feeling like a beer hoarder.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 2018 vintage, 12oz bottle. Black with a tan head of fine, frothy bubbles. This has a more impressive head than any other barrel-aged stout I can recall. Effusive aroma that initially suggests vanilla and toasted marshmallows. There's a distinct note of bourbon-soaked wood, but the aroma here is far from being excessively hot and boozy like with some barrel-aged beers. Ripe dark fruit notes (raisin/currant) as well, similar to Bourbon County Brand Stout in that respect.    Flavor profile is rich and sweet with a touch of alcohol on the finish. A fair bit sweeter than the KBS I had just a week ago, though I'm enjoying this at closer to room temperature. Personally, I think the sweetness suits this beer nicely, but it's just a bit much here. While I've never had this, I have had Sucaba, and the two are similar in how much residual sugar is present. The mouthfeel is just about perfect, though. It's just impossibly smooth and totally devoid of any harshness, yet not flat-tasting. Tons of rum-soaked fruit character here, comparatively little roasted malt character or other typically stout-like flavors. It's really more of a barleywine-like flavor profile overall.    For years, Parabola has eluded me. I finally got my hands on a bottle, and now I wish I'd gotten more. The reviews don't lie - this is a world-class beer.

There's a minimal amount of head, and not much resulting lacing.    Smell has tons of anise. There's also cola and cilantro. Very thick sorghum.    First of all, it's a sipper. Very intense. If I could sum it all up concisely, it's like a coffee-flavored dark rum. Toasted sugar provides the backdrop for everything else. It's beyond toasty, even, all the way to smoky. (Not quite all the way to charred barrel though.) Anise and cilantro are dialed way back. The coffee flavor isn't as fresh as some that I've had. Bits of both coconut husk and fine tobacco.    I can't tell that this is a fifteener; the alcohol is very well hidden. Minimal carbonation. Medium-heavy for the type. Aftertaste is sweet and smoky, along with an herbal element that's not overly strong.

Overall this is a very well-crafted beer period thinner than you might expect and more carbonated than you might expect but with an amazingly Blended profile drinking this pretty fresh so it may be a bit hot Pierce to see how it ages

The head starts off at 1/2 finger and recedes to a thin ring of beige.     Aroma slaps you in the face immediately with sappy, rich caramel; piping hot fudge; bourbon; vanilla; with faint dark fruits and tobacco lingering in the far background. It invokes a saliva pool in the mouth. I'm just spending minutes smelling it. It's so great.     The flavor does not live up to the nose. I get a lot of cardboard/oak to start, a huge wave of antiseptic whiskey, ghost notes of black cherry, tobacco, and vanilla. The bourbon heat practically wells up and burns the nostrils as the beer is swallowed. A bit too hot for me.     Feel is slightly thinner than I'd like but not terrible. The whiskey really thins the beer out. It's got a subtle roasty character with lots of heat, some slight parch.     Overall, not as great as I thought it'd be. I'd be willing to try ONE bottle when it comes out this year (2018) to see if they were able to dial down the alcohol a touch. This was like drinking straight whiskey. Very potent.

I like the way it sticks to the sides of my glass and the lacing remains after some time. I don't smell as much bourbon as I would expect from some BA stouts which surprises me. Maybe I've just become so much more use to them now. Nice rich sweet dark chocolate flavors. I'll have to drink it next to a KBS, but I like it more than Black Note and maybe not quite as much as a BCS. Don't pass it up when you have the chance to try one though!

Amazing nose with loads of barrel including hints of chocolate and coffee.    Up first is the sweetness from the bourbon barrels followed by coffee and a hint of vanilla. A bit later the chocolate appears and gives way to black cherry.    Velvety smooth yet mouth coating which leads to a obscenely long finish balanced between flavour and warmth.    It's a sipper but I'm struggling to put it down.

Aroma is bourbon, barrel, oak, oats, caramel, and toffee with roasted and toasted malts. It's hearty and filling, just after taking a whiff. There is a kiss of heat at the back from the bourbon. Flavor profile is caramel, toffee, molasses, oak, with bourbon becoming more apparent at the finish. It's never boozy, nor hot despite have a hearty dose of bourbon in each sip. Toasted and roasted malts form a firm and strong base for this hearty beer. Mouth feel is thick, with a velvety, creamy texture that provides and expansive, filling experience. Overall, a hearty stout with lots of depth and a good level of bourbon without being overly powering or heavy. In fact, the only indicator that this beer is 14% ABV is the label, otherwise it is smooth.     Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.

The barrel comes across first, but the chocolate notes mute the booze factor, and then an absolutely decadent caramel flavor carries this home to a rich and creamy finish.    Truly a world-class Beer, IMHO.

Very complex nose with dark chocolate, bourbon, dark fruit, coffee.    Taste follows the nose but the flavors are even deeper. Phenomenal interplay between bourbon, dark chocolate, raisin, oak. Doesn’t have quite the in-your-face bourbon quality of a BCBS, but there is quite a bit more going on and it’s all balanced perfectly.    Rich, full-bodied, medium-low carbonation.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Appearance is of motor oil. Head was milk chocolate colored and quickly dissipated,    On the nose, chocolate fudge and vanilla beans take the lead. Alcohol evaporation allows the Bourbon presence to present itself firmly, yet delicately. The oak characteristic from the Bourbon barrel lingers nicely at the end of the nose in tandem with a nice cold pressed coffee note from the roasted barley. Not so prominently, black cherry notes distinguish themselves amongst what one may arbitrarily label as "dark fruit". Overall, an incredible nose. It is very subdued when cold. Let this one warm to fully take in the nose. I suggest drinking half the glass, agitate it aggressively, then take it all in.    The flavor profile is absolutely astonishing. At first it was almost too much. It took 4 sips to be able to grab the reigns of this wildly complex stout. Intriguingly so, the vanilla bean profile of the nose is indistinguishable from the semi-sweet milk chocolate charactersitc on the palate. The chocolate dominates the initial palate with the black cherry lingering right behind it. In the middle of the palate the bourbon evaporates into the naval cavity, acknowledging its existence, but does not yield an off-putting bourbon flavor and alcohol astringency. The final palate smooths with a nice cold pressed coffee in juxtaposition to a clear oak character which leaves a nice drying sensation. The finish is of coffee and dark chocolate. Absolutely splendid.       The mouthfeel was characteristic of any high quality BBA imperial stout. Thick, but not syrup viscosity. Slight drying sensation when the oak notes begin to dominate. The initial palate is overwhelming. Allow your palate to acclimate before judging this stout.     Overall, I was lucky to come across a 2017 Vintage bottle of this in one of my local bottle shops. One of the best beers I have ever had. It rivals BCBS, Black Note, CBS, KBS, Eternal Rest, and Firestone 21 Anniversary which are all examples of my highly acclaimed beers.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Pours very dark with a very small head that leaves a creamy ring but not lacing. Nose has quite a lot of bourbon along with some sweet caramel and vanilla, but few roasted notes. Maybe the most noticeable BA influence I've ever seen on the smell of a beer. Taste, for a whopping 14.5% ABV, is indeed full and rich, but only as boozy as a 10% beer. Again, plenty of bourbon present along with some residual sweetness, but much less cloying as some other "over the top" beers. Vanilla is prominent as well, and everything is well integrated at 6 months. Altogether, it is pretty special and certainly one of the better BA beers I've had.

look: 2.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Nearly no head from the initial pour. It settles to zero bubbles and therefore no lace. The liquid is naturally dark brown with little light shining through the edge of the glass.     Uber-sweet nose, like a barley wine. Strong sweet cherry and brandy notes. Surprisingly complex given that the smell is entirely from the malt (no hop or yeast to be found).     Very rich body (similar to whole milk). The carbonation is muted but definitely cuts the initial sweetness. The taste has enough burnt elements to cut the berry like flavors and bring a complex array of flavors. The alcohol is strong and warming. The swallow draws of this together for the complete experience. The aftertaste is similar to finishing a cognac -- warming with dark cherry overtones.

S-Cold the aroma is fairly subdued with noticeable notes of vanilla, chocolate, bourbon barrel, big dark roasted malt. Not a lot changes as it warms.  T-Still lots of barrel and bourbon flavors prominent. Some notes of Maillard rxn sweetness, but bigger on the dark roasted malt flavors with a hint of black licorice. As it warms it tastes more like a boozy campfire smore, which is a good thing.  M-Low carbonation. Moderate body for style. Some alcohol burn both in the mouth and in the finish. More vapory then most.   O-A monster BB stout. Flavorful and bold, drinking a bomber of this is a great idea.

If I had one of the older bombers, I'd probably drink too much of this 13.4% ABV brew.    Had a 2017 bottle, and was very much impressed. Dark, deep, and delicious pretty much sums it up.     If you want details, depth is bourbon barrel flavors, that amplifies a nice base IS. Excellent sweet maltiness and a great finish of brown sugar and malt. Nicely done!    I rate this above Narhwal, which is high praise. I note that Narwhal is not BA, and a I generally prefer non-BA IS. But Parabola challenges that order.

I doubt there's much need to add another score to the database, but here goes--this is based on a 2016 bomber. Pours on the thin side, thin but dark. Half a finger of very light-colored head. Smells rich and malty, with some vinous notes more akin to an oloroso or PX sherry. Some vanilla and dark chocolate come in on the palate, leading to a finish that's moderately dry at first, but eventually produces an aftertaste of brown sugar and raisins mixed into oatmeal.

look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 (12 oz bottle 2017 vintage; shared, split b/w two 5 oz snifters)    L: cap came off easily w/o much of a hiss, beer was carefully poured but nearly no foam formed    S: mostly the stout malts come through, with a dense essence of fresh oak, charred oak, hint of vanilla extract... not sure what the draw from then blend of multiple branded barrels adds besides perhaps a more layered depth to the bourbon character... alcohol pretty well tamed    T: thick, luscious concentrate of caramel and delicately roasty malt; notes of licorice and hints of high cacao chocolate and smoky coffee... not an over-present barrel character, its nuances nicely interwoven with its stalwart stout backbone...while its taste is rich and satisfying, I can't help but wonder about the flavors of the base beer, un-barrel aged, because it seems any more subtle, gritty grain character may have been lost to the aging and bourbon-y intrusion    F: delicately-carbonated, dry malt liqueur... smooth, quiet, polished edges, little residual sugary slickness... alcohol is relatively mellow - little heat, no burn - comes across as having 2/3 the abv    O: fantastic, a standout in their barrel-aged program... it doesn't hurt when executing a beer like this to push elements to the extreme (abv, variety of barrel sources), makes for a fuller flavor one would assume, but for me it results in some perceived static, redundant layering

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 From a 2014 bottle.    I sat on this baby for three years, and it was worth the wait. I don't have a side by side with a current vintage, so I can't really compare what the aging did. Let's just say the overall beer is quite excellent.    Interestingly enough to me, I'm more noticing the RIS character than I am the bourbon barrel effect. Oh, the bourbon is there, for sure, but it's not the first or most prominent thing I notice. Instead, I'm getting a pronounced licorice/tobacco taste, along with some dark, dark fruits, and then the bourbon coming in at the end. I think this would be a fascinating beer even without the bourbon barrel aging.

Big aroma of wood, dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, distant cherry and earthy hops.    Earthy, almost tobacco-like taste with bitter chocolate and hops, a hint of marshmallow underneath and a strong alcohol burn on the backend. Bitterness lingers in the aftertaste.    Thinner bodied than expected, but still with a full, mildly creamy feel that coats the mouth, and just enough carbonation.    I put this squarely in the "not effing around" category of BBA stouts. Dark and rich from start to finish. Absolutely delicious. 01/16/17 bottling date.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 On tap at Firestone Walker The Propagator, Venice. A 6 oz pour into a Firestone Walker tulip glass.    Appearance: It was a black to dark dark brown in colour with a one finger creamy tanned head that had good retention and left nice lacing.    Aroma: Sweet bourbon barrels, nutty chocolate, vanilla, banana cake, pretty much like dessert.    Taste: Like the aroma, there was bitter dark chocolate, cherry, vanilla, banana, nutty, sweet bourbon, oak and booze.    Mouthfeel: Full bodied with low carbonation.    Overall: A little bit too boozy and on the sweet side, but this doesn’t put me off, and it was still very nice. Great for late night sipping.

Seemed a bit of a boozy smell at first, then could detect chocolate, coconut, and sweetness.    Starts out sweet, then chocolate and cherry kick in. Really reminds me of a Bavarian Forest Cake with the chocolate and cherry, with a nice hint of vanilla at the finish.    Feel is a bit thinner than expected, overall a bit on the harsh side.    Very much a high quality beer. I do feel it is a bit rough around the edges, I would be interested to see what aging would do for this. Very much worth a try, and is possible, grab an extra to age it.

THE best barrel aged beer i've ever had.    I greatly appreciate my supervisor picking me up 2 bottles on his trip to Cali

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Serving type: bottle split with a buddy, into an 8 oz tulip. 2017 12 oz bottle.    Pours a extremely dark cola brown, essentially black except at the edges. Initial smells are of bakers chocolate, subtle coconut, cookie dough, with some coffee/mocha near the end. Taste reflects the smell. Initial mocha flavors lead into dark chocolate with finish with a sweeter chocolate flavor that finishes with a cookie like finish. Excellent. Feel isn't as thick as your would expect for a high gravity Russian oatmeal stout but it is pleasant. Overall, this is a really good beer with flavors and aromas all around. Glad I got to tick this one off.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 12oz bottle, in a nicely informative cardboard sleeve. Apparently this one was actually brewed at Boulevard in Kansas City - whatever, this is a brew that I've wanted to try for quite some time.    This beer pours a solid black abyss, yet with evident red-cola basal edges, and two flabby fingers of puffy, finely foamy, and somewhat bubbly brown head, which leaves a monolithic wall of cliff face lace around the glass as it lazily sinks away.    It smells of bittersweet cocoa powder, bready and doughy caramel malt, biscuity and gooey toffee squares, a mild vulcanized rubber note, free-range char, vanilla-forward Bourbon wood, an indistinct dark orchard fruitiness, ephemeral cafe-au-lait, and some tame leafy, weedy, and certainly sauced-up floral green hop bitters. The taste is roasted caramel/toffee malt, intense Bourbon County essences (vanilla, boozy wood, and blurred spice), those brandy-laced milk chocolates you used to find at Christmas parties, Scandihoovian anise candies, cherry vodka, subtle artisanal coffee beans, and more laid-back earthy, musty, and soused floral verdant hoppiness.    The carbonation is fairly understated in its overlooked frothiness, the body a solid medium-heavy weight, and actually (was there ever any doubt?) rather smooth, with a big-boy creaminess not waiting for a sign to emerge at will. It finishes well off-dry, the cocoa, caramel, Kentucky whiskey, and mixed benign fruitiness carrying the lingering day.    Overall - sometimes meeting your heroes doesn't exactly meet up with expectations, and I'm happy to say that isn't the case here. Yup, a big and brash, besotted Stateside RIS, one thankfully delivered to we north of the border fans of the style. I put off pulling the trigger on this dear offering for a couple months when it first arrived here, but last weekend I was beer shopping on my birthday (akin to hitting the grocery store when you're peckish), and well, y'all know the rest of the story.

Decent carbonation, forms a mocha cream foam cap, quickly it fades away to some thin edging.    Spicy chocolate aroma, black liquorice, charred wheat, sweet dark fruits, marshmallows , oak cask, cherries and coffee round out the nose.    A big dark coffee with cherries flavor hits first, sweet dark berries, oakie cask vanilla, the malt complexity is massive, big boozy heat, 14.5 is no joke and boy to does it ever have a warming buzz. Dense chocolate and under currents of sweet fruits, oak and heat.     The mouthfeel is full but not super thick, rather oily, nice bite and a very warming, boozy heat tingle.     If your bottle comes from a cooler, don't forget to let it warm up a bit. Big, dense flavor's pop out more, later on. A sour, earthy, wet cardboard edge comes off from the house British ale yeast, the 69 ibu's bring in, semi-bitter, dry earthy tones which mingles well with the vast depth of malty and cask barrel complexities. My lips are sticky.     Reminds me very much a slightly hopped-up, boozy version of Courage RIS. This one would do very well laid down in a cellar for the next 10 years. I feel it might be a bit "green" at this point in it's life. Bottled on 1/16/17. Opened on 7/7/17. Makes it pretty young for a Stout this huge. Being as strong as almost any California Red Zinfandel wine, the complexities will mature with age in the bottle. The 2017 vintage is a real treat for any beer geek or RIS lover.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 12 oz bottle of 2017 Parabola (packaged 01/16/17) poured into belgian tulip glass.    Beautiful dark dark brown-black body (103 SRM midnight black) with a thin tan head. Dissolves quickly into an everlasting thin ring of tan foam around the edge of the glass - moderate lacing. Smells of woody oakey vanilla sweetness and dark fruity chocolate along with hints of sweet bourbon. The taste is truly amazing. Such a fine balance of bourbon from the woodford reserve and four roses bourbon (amongst my affordable favorites) along with a couple others I have not tried. The oakey vanilla, fruity cherry-like sweetness and the lightly bitter cocoa followed by the smallest hint of coffee notes project the fine bourbon notes and generous heat with a pleasing intensity. This balance makes for an all-time favorite of mine. Truly a complex layering of flavor. (I'm not a huge fan off heavy coffee notes in my BA stouts so this is a gulp of fresh air). Mouthfeel is perfect, not even close too overly-syrupy yet plenty of thickness from the careful balance of malts. I am looking forward to my next purchase of this BA'ed russian imperial oatmeal stout, even at $10 a bottle.

Taste sweet but soon turns to woody oak mostly and then damn it's bitter on the back end. I'd prefer this to be a bit more full bodied but I'd say thin to medium mouth feel. Overall, a pretty good beer. Not Bourbon County Stout good but worth a go if you find it. Not sure I'd get it again though honestly. Just not as sweet as I'd prefer or had from other offerings.     After swishing it a bit I get this "corn" kind of flavor.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 I get the hype, and can't help but give it all 5s. I found out that it was available at my local Total Wine and More, and bumped it right to the top of my list. I bought 2 -twelve ounce bottles at $8.99 a piece. My investment was worth every penny.    Look- The body is a deep, dark, almost- black brown. The head consisted of just the tiniest of tan around the rim, likely due the heavy gravity. The beer is very syrupy looking, and there was no detectable lacing. If there was such a thing as Black Port Wine, this is how I would envision it.    Smell- A blend of licorice, molasses , a little vanilla, and alcohol.    Taste- The licorice and molasses are noted in roughly equal amounts. It is fairly sweet, and I only detected the alcohol at the end. The power of the taste is very robust.    Mouthfeel- Very, very smooth. The body is very heavy and a bit syrupy. There is a little bit of a licorice aftertaste on the tongue and back of the throat, and the 14.5% alchohol numbs the side of the tongue just a bit.    Overall - I love Stouts of all kinds. I have had a few barrel aged, but have found them all lacking in one aspect or another. This one delivers in all aspects. I was genuinely amazed.    I would recommend drinking this one by itself rather than pairing it. It stands alone in a wonderful way. I would also suggest it as a nightcap, as it will be hard to top,and is super potent. I have given other beers perfect 5s, but this one might be king of the hill for me.     P.S.- My rating is for the 2017 vintage, specifically. I don't know how it compares to its counterparts from prior years.

Small light tan head with no lacing, but does leave a thin ring.    S: When you can smell the barrel from four feet away, you know its powerful. Lots of dark dried fruits and roasted malts as well. A very very small amount of alcohol does waft in.     T: Bourbon barrel, but more restrained than you would get from nose. Lots of dark fruit and sweetness, like molasses. Malt, flaked oats, and bourbon heat on back end. Heat pretty well managed.    F: More medium than full-bodied, which surprised me. Might do well with more aging. Not much in the way of carbonation.

The smoothness and roastiness of an excellently crafted imperial stout with the flavor complexity as a result of being mellowed in a blend of barrels formely holding world class bourbon. Oak, toffee, toasted coconut, earthy spice combines with bitter chocolate, coffee (from the roasted malt), charred grains with a little molasses on the backend. Bitter, sweet, roasty, oaky all at once - this is one to behold. Silky smooth with a creamy mouthfeel throughout. Warmth not heat from the ABV. World class.

look: 3.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 Firestone Walker Parabola (2017)    A: This legendary barrel-aged imperial stout is one half of the duo that built one of the most highly-regarded barrel-aging programs in the country (Sucaba being the other half). Interestingly, Parabola pours a very dark brown like black coffee rather than the pitch black one associates with BA stouts. A khaki head of about a finger forms on a hard pour, but it does not hang around long. Lacing is spotty but alcohol legs are evident. Viscosity appears rather low for the style. This is not the picture one would find in the style guide next to "barrel-aged imperial stout." 3.25/5    A: The nose does not show much nuance, at least when cold. Bourbon dominates with sweetness, cherries, caramel, toasted coconut, and a fair bit of alcohol heat. Milk chocolate flecked with vanilla is the only real hint of the base beer initially. As it warms, the balance somehow becomes slightly worse, with the bourbon nearly edging the beer completely out of the picture. Spicy whiskey, oak, and again toasted coconut are prevalent. It is nice but shows little deftness or subtlety. 3.5/5    T: The taste does come close to saving this now-legendary beer, but it still does not totally deliver on the hype. There is more chocolate here along with a dark breadiness that is rare in stouts, but overall this is still a barrel showcase. There is a bit of brownie batter and elements of cocoa, as well as some smokiness that creeps in late. It is all well and good that spicy-sweet bourbon steals the show, highlighted by vanilla, toasted coconut, and surprising amounts of cherry, but at the expense of the base beer it is hardly laudable. Umami plays a tertiary role, which adds a bit of depth. The amount of fruity character is novel, pointing more towards Russian Imperial Stout than its American counterpart. BA RISs are surprisingly not all that common, so this is welcome in that respect, but the balance between barrel and beer is still a fair bit off the mark. 4.25/5    M: Here is perhaps the greatest misstep in the form of a rather thin body combined with very obvious heat. There is an oily slickness present as well, which does nothing to improve the situation. It is not thick enough to really impress, but it is not dry enough or low enough in alcohol to match the thinness. It is serviceable but not optimal in any sense. 3/5    O: While this was once a beer I held in high esteem, it seems that Parabola is no longer what I thought it was. Certainly it is a solid, even good beer, perhaps even very good, but it is a far cry from greatness. Little to nothing about this beer has not been eclipsed at this point, and though there is something to be said about the pillar of style that this beer is perceived as, it seems to be resting on its laurels. I do really enjoy the RIS aspects, but they are pushed so far to one side by the barrel that it is almost negligible. Bourbon County is still superior in every way to almost any BA stout, so Parabola should be given little leeway despite its historical significance and name recognition. It is enjoyable, certainly, but it does not deserve to be held up as a paragon of the style, and the mouthfeel is really a huge letdown. Pair with Dream Theater's "Octavarium," an album that many will cite as important, yet it broke next to no new ground and is easily eclipsed by contemporaries as well as those that came after. 3.5/5

Minimal lacing, some alcohol legs.    Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, whiskey, vanilla, dark fruit, almonds, chocolate. Roasty and nutty overall.    Tastes of roasted malt, light coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, whiskey, oak, almond, toffee, caramel, cola. Light sweetness, lingering char bitterness.    Feel is a bit thin for my liking and carbonation is a little low, warming alcohol, between sweet and dry.    Overall it's a tasty BA RIS, and smells great, but it's just too thin for its huge character, doesn't need to be sweet or syrupy just fuller. And it could use a boost in appearance as well.

I knew right away after pouring this beer that it wasn't going to live up to the hype. It's dark, sure, but it lacks that motor-oil appearance I look for in a really good russian imperial stout. Light escaped around the edges and gave it a cola appearance in those places.     Smell was mostly bourbon and dark malts. A little chocolate and coffee, with burnt nuts at the end of the nose.     Taste was bourbon and roasted malts. I didn't get much depth.     Feel is where it went South for me. This is way too thin, in my opinion, to be a world class RIS. Maybe it's because this batch was brewed off site?    Overall I don't get the hype. It's a good RIS, but I don't feel like it warrants the accolades it has collected. Maybe I'm missing something, or maybe it's just not in my taste range. Glad I got to try it though.

With Boulevard in KC, MO.    Color is lighter than I expected during the pour. Light cola colored, light tan one finger head dissipates quickly. Nearly opaque in the glass.    Deep roast malts and prominent charred wood initial smell. Vanilla and chocolate as well, faint coffee. Little in way of fruits but I'd rather my stouts carry what I'm picking up now than the fruit.    Taste carries with deep charred wood and hefty on the vanilla flavors. Some chocolate but I think the barrel wood and vanilla dominate, but the subtle whisky booze carries nicely thru. More booziness as it warms some along with roasted coffee bitterness. Fairly complex flavor profile.    Feel is a full medium body, but wouldn't say it's "thick" and lower side of medium carbonation. Was thinking it be a bit more slick and viscous and less carbonated. A touch of alcohol burn but Doesn't detract from anything.    Glad to finally give this one a try. It's a bit lighter than I expected for such a big beer but array of flavors more than make up for that. Got 3 more and looking forward to trying a few with some time on them.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 This was the 2017 vintage and my first ever Parabola. Looks like dark fudge in a glass and sticks to the glass with some serious alcohol legs. Smell is dark fruit, chocolate and barrel character. Taste follows nose with addition of vanilla and bourbon from the barrels and the flavor really evolves as it warms. Mouthfeel is thick and sludgy. Great beer that I'm glad I finally got to try. I managed to get a second bottle which I'm going to cellar for a year or two. Can't wait to see how it changes.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Parabola (2015 Vintage) Aged for two years.    The beer pours a nice creamy tan head that dissipates fairly quickly while leaving a nice ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is a nice dark chocolate black with a nice, shiny, and slick looking surface. It definitely looks like it drinks smoothly.    The smell is pretty good. The taste is better than the smell but it isn't without its charm. The smell seems to have a stronger coffee note mixed in the bourbon along with a decent char note and some nice fire from the alcohol.    The taste is fantastic. It has a nice blend of barrel aged beers whose notes mix fantastically with the beer notes. The stronger notes tend to come from the barrel notes but only barely. The beer notes tend to fall more towards the sweet dark chocolate notes and a very light roasted malt note and hop bitterness in the finish. The barrel notes are sweet with a good bourbon in the finish. The charred oak is definitely there but it's hard to identify it. There is also a good vanilla note that makes itself known by peeking through the chocolate.    The feel is pretty good. It's a heavy bodied beer that is extremely drinkable and dangerously so. The feel is extremely smooth with a slight thinness from the barrel aging to it. The carbonation is extremely light and tingly enough to give it a good texture to remind you that it's a beer. There is a slight alcohol burn to it in the finish and the smell.    Overall, this a pretty good beer and it seems to have aged extremely well. The aroma and taste are absolutely fantastic and create a great experience. If you manage to run across this, grab since it seems to have aged fairly well but seems like it could use an extra year or two.

Paired with 70% dark chocolate (Chocolove Strong Dark), which I recommend doing!  Pours an extremely dark opaque brown, not quite black, with a thin but even brown head without a lot of bubbles rising from the bottom. I highly recommend drinking this after it has warmed and breathed a bit.  Smell is of milk chocolate, roasted coffee, toasted caramelizad malts, bourbon. Taste follows the nose with the addition of some bitterness and unfortunately is dominated by ethanol as well, a bit strong for me... but again, wait and let it warm and breathe and it doesn't diminish, but seems to make more sense. Mouthfeel is slick and mouth coating, somewhat resinous, and aftertaste is a bit bitter with some burnt character as well as some alcohol burn. Overall very well done but not necessarily up to the hype.

Also, not too hot for 14.5%, and a bit browner than I remember in the appearance. Getting phantom stickee monkee notes too. good stuff

At $11/12oz., even more expensive than BCBS. The premium bourbon barrels it is aged in and the length of aging are perhaps part of the reason for that.    Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a Samuel Smith English tulip.    a: Opaque black with a hint of clear ruby at the very bottom. Two inch thick tan head receded slowly to dense lacing over even surface foam.    s: Dark roasty malt, chocolate and whiskey    t; Follows the nose with more emphasis on the chocolate and whiskey, which leaves a burning throat from the very high ABV. Sweetish finish. Later, barleywine fruitiness takes over from the initial chocolate notes.    m; Full, great body and moderate carbonation tingle.    o; Outstanding as expected, smoother overall than BCBS, if perhaps a bit lighter. Will still be buying Backwoods Bastard, Central Waters BBA Scotch Ale, Weyerbacher Insanity and New Holland Dragon's Milk for barrel aged darkness, but this may very well top the list, albeit the least accessible and affordable among them and also tasting at times less like an RIS and more like a barleywine.

O: Good, but not as good as I remember last year. Is it because it was brewed in Kansas City by Boulevard Brewing this year? I'm hoping time will mellow it out.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 WOW, just tried a 5 year aged bottle. This beer is legit! It pours dark as can be. The nose is strong of bourbon and molasses. There was no head whatsoever, and very little carbonation. First taste is smooth and full of flavor. Deep, but not bitter, essences of molasses. Not much of a aftertaste, which surprises me. Great beer. Wish I had a case to age.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.75 I had the 2016 release out of a bomber. A little too syrupy and boozy for me. 
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Very dark brown with the smallest brown head that lasts only seconds. Plenty of bourbon, chocolate, coffee, dark sweet fruits. Alcohol is mostly hidden but there is a bit. But for a 14% I'm very impressed for how well it's hidden. The body is a little thinner than I'd like but not bad. Low carbonation. This is a dipper, and man it's good.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Picked up from Total Wine, Woodland Hills CA. Poured into a snifter. 2017 vintage: 69.0 IBU, 14.5% ABV, 12oz bottle.    Look: Pours jet black, small dark tan head of foam, quickly dissipating. Very little, quickly dissolving lace.  Smell: Strong coffee notes initially greet your nose, followed by a pleasant bitter booziness. Balanced by a deep cherry and plum fruitiness and an very apparent charred oak profile that I initially missed. Amazing finish.  Taste: Chocolate, bourbon, and coffee all perfectly balance in an incredible symphony of dark, roasty and subtley sweet flavors. Again that subtle fruitiness like dried cherries or raisins, with a lingering hop bitterness.   Feel: Incredibly smooth for its 14.5% ABV. Sticky, very low carbonation that gives a nice sting to the tip of your tongue as you gather the flavors on your palate. Heavy bodied but I've never had a stout that balanced it so well with a such a level of seltzery carbonation that you barely notice. Amazing.    Shit, there's no way around this one. Imperial stouts like Speedway and Old Rasputin deserve their place, but there is a reason that this beer is considered one of the best in the world. Having just recently hit shelves with this 2017 vintage, do not miss your chance to get a hold of this incredible imperial stout. $9.99 a bottle.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 A 12 oz bottle (2017) poured into a snifter.     Look- A dark brown almost black color. A thin tan head with little lacing sticking around the glass. It looked rather thin for a stout but...    Smell- Fantastic dark chocolate, vanilla, dried fruit and light alcohol. The smell seemed to be more sweet chocolate around the halfway point of the glass. Such a unique blend     Taste- The chocolate and dried fruits mixed with an alcohol kicker. The thin look was very deceptive. A thick sweet chocolate taste with more oak than the smell led me to believe. Never would have guessed a 14%+ ABV stout could be so sweet.     Mouthfeel- Sticky and thick sweetness from the first drink to the last. Reminds me of chocolate covered raisins. A little dryness toward the end.     Overall- A phenomenal high ABV stout with little alcohol taste. If you like a sweet fruity stout this is probably the best. I would love to a bottle to age for a year or so.

S: Cold out of the bottle strong boozy notes then as it warmed chocolate, oak, and light vanilla appeared.    T: Hot from the alcohol. Oak and dark fruits. Light chocolate flavors as it warms.    F: This is where the big disappointment comes from. Thin and watery, nothing like any previous years I've had. We even opened a '15 next to it to confirm.     O: Since it was so easy to find I will give it another shot next year. If it fails to impress then there's no reason to bother since the the market has become so competitive and other options are so readily available.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Fresh 2017 poured into a snifter    L - (4) dark murky brown coming out of the bottle. Dark cola black in the glass. The head is a light khaki and creamy looking. Only rated 4 on look because it looks terribly thin for a 14.5%. I prefer my big stouts syrupy thick. Lacing is extremely sticky from the high alcohol.    S - (4.75) nice. Dark fruits. Plums, grapes, and alcohol soaked raisens. Loads of vanilla. Excellent bourbon presence on the nose. Oak, leather, vanilla ice cream, molasses are all triggered in my nose. Love this.    T/M - (4.75)/(4.74) wow was I wrong. This is thick and chewy as can be. Decadently creamy and reminiscent of bcbs on the feel. It tastes of the nose with a little extra char of smoldering oak. Heavy on the fruit flavors. Very, very sweet. Spicy alcohol burn.     O - (4.75) this is stellar. I literally just made a thread on the forums looking for dark fruit forward big stouts and this is exactly what I was after. This is every bit worth its high regarded rating. I would LOVE to do a side by side with bcbs.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Dark muddy, mucky brown, including an unusual amount of floaters when held up to the light, with a tan, bubbly blanket.    Smell is rich, as in money! Maple, vanilla, coconut, fine bourbon, oak, Tootsie Roll, nougat, and amaretto. Some heat tickles the nostrils.    Taste changes it up, starting with raisin, molasses, charred oak, and bourbon. After a short while, it starts developing into warm Kahlua, or even a hot toddy. Further along, I then get cocoa, rich toffee, glazed nuts, and hints of raspberry, amaretto, and spicy cologne.    Medium body with a thin but substantial froth, finishing a little sticky and semi-dry. Definitely warming, at least. Lip tingling. Maybe even a little boozy at times, but all the other elements seem to smooth it out.

I had wanted to try Parabola for a few years, but never wanted to pay for the cost of admission. I had a chance to taste it at a bottle share mid-March 2017 and, while it was a very good beer, it wasn't nearly as good as many other barrel-aged stouts that I have had. In fact, I preferred Sucaba over it... and I am not really a big barleywine fan.

Appearance: Deep cola brown with clear mahogany edges and a brief but lush head of tan foam.    Smell: Full aroma of burnt caramel, charred barrels, vanilla beans, Bounty chocolate bars and bourbon.    Taste: Massive layers of roasted malt, cocoa powder, warmly sweet and boozy bourbon, and some oak barrel tannins. Just enough roasted coffee bitterness for balance.    Mouthfeel: Medium to full body, oily smooth and rich, with moderate but soft carbonation.    Overall: A huge, boozy beer - deeply flavorful and complex with plenty of bourbon barrel influence, but somehow perfectly integrated and balanced.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 2015 vinatage  The look is a beautiful dark almost black but the head is surprisingly thin and white.   The smell is also beautiful and delicate but is honestly surprisingly light and simple. Chocolatey with a subtle note of roasted nuts. Very milder smell than I expected, especially at cellar, not refrigerator, temperature.  The taste strikes an elegant balance for a bourbon aged stout. I'm also drinking it almost 2 years after it was barreled. The front is a deliciously bitter-sweet flavor that exemplifies stout in my mind, and is reminiscent of good dark chocolate. The bourbon makes itself known quietly on the tail end, after the liquid has passed. Very nice  The mouth feel is a great balance of full and light. Creamy and complete as it passes your palette, it fizzes off nicely leaving a delicious taste without a residue.

Some underlying coffee notes come out as well    T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of roasted malt, bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark fruit, coffee, dark chocolate, and caramel. Goes into more notes of the barrel, including coconut and leather. Alcohol is quite present but doesn't overwhelm anything and works quite well with all of the other flavors. Finishes with warming alcohol, plenty of barrel character, and roast    M: Full bodied with low-moderate carbonation. Very smooth    O: Easily in the top-tier of BBA stouts. Great for sipping, as it really unfolds as it warms from fridge or cellar temp to room temp. Do not pass this one by

Slight smoke and charred wood as well. The swallow brings more charred wood and smoke with lingering roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee with some lingering caramel and vanilla  M: This beer is big and silky smooth on the palate with soft but adequate carbonation. The beer has a dry finish but that is to be expected.  O: Overall this beer is worthy of its reputation. It's big and beautiful with an amazing amount of flavor and complexity without overpowering the palate. Balanced yet still a heavy hitter. This is a beer that I always want to have on hand.

Warm, luscious bourbon notes on the nose - sticky caramel, vanilla - with some medium chocolate malt which adds to the decadence. Flavor profile is traditional, but everything is balanced for the most part. Lots of smooth oak caramel tones upfront, the vanilla after that...the bourbon flavors are more assertive than the base elements - I would have liked to see that roasted malt / chocolate flavor present for sure - but isn't hot or boozey. Ends with some toffee sweetness from the bourbon. A little thin on the mouthfeel for how I like my bigger stouts.

Thanks to the Beer Junction for holding this while I flew across the country to pick it up.    A: Dark brown/black with mainly foam for a head that quickly dissipated. Spotty lacing.    S: My favorite part of the experience. Rich, bourbon-y, chocolate, molasses, caramel and more bourbon. I could sniff this one all night.    T: An explosion of rich tastes. Chocolate, bourbon, molasses, oak, coffee, and some dark fruits. Sip and be awed. As it warmed, the flavors only increased.    M: Medium to heavy with creamy carbonation.    O: This is beer decadence at its finest. Glad I got to add this one to my beer bucket list. Wow.

This is a 2016 vintage (cellared for 6 months); 650 ml bottle into pint glass. Pours a very dark brown, with almost zero light leakage at the glass. Thin tan head. Initial impression is...oh, my. Creamy-smooth, sweet chocolate, molasses, caramel, oak, booze, coffee, and a little dark fruit combine in an absolutely exquisite BA Stout. Mouthfeel is thick and oily; carbonation is light and doesn't dare interfere with the taste. Finish is very smooth. (Due to the cellaring? I wish I could have bought two bottles and tried one fresh, but no such luck.) Slight bitterness lingers in the back of the throat, inviting another sip.  This is just excellent.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 2016 aged at 33 degrees shortly after bottling. Pours dark as a starless night. One finger of head that quickly dissipates leaving no lacing. At 13.1% ABV, head characteristics are difficult to produce so an allowance shall be made and an outstanding score awarded.    World class complex nose of dark fruit (plum, raisin), bourbon, caramel, vanilla, molasses and subtle chocolate over a background of tobacco and oak. The nose is a rich mixture than blends exceptionally well then fades into the bold tobacco and charred oak background.     Light full body that is substantial and almost achieves creamy. The high alcohol content produces a rich velvety smoothness that coats and flows across the tongue. Carbonation is light due to barrel aging, yet produces a noticeable effervescence in the middle and a slightly prickly finish. All things considered, the palate characteristics are quite outstanding.    The flavor profile is world class and quite worthy of this beer's reputation. At first chocolate is light but gains in prominence through the experience. It never achieves dominance but lets its presence always be known - especially from about three quarters through.     Bourbon is similar except that it peaks during the first quarter. In the middle lies the true richness of this beer. Dark fruits explode and then succumb to caramel and molasses bringing with it a solid sweetness as a contrast to the bold elements of this beer. These, in turn, fall to the bold tobacco and charred oak notes which are preceded slightly by a vanilla burst. The finish is a slow fade of blended flavor with tobacco, oak and vanilla lingering. Alcohol remains covered until a nice burn at the finish.

The appearance is pitch black with no head retention. Big alcohol legs too.    The aroma is a wonderful mix of bourbon, oak, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits and a hint of booze sweetness.    The taste follows the nose with a big bourbon kick up front with a complex mix of flavors. Really decadent yet not overtly sweet.    The palate is full with a lingering bourbon spice that warms the throat going down.     Overall this is an awesome beer and yet another great barrel aged beer from FW. Definitely lives up to the hype.

Only the faintest ring of bubbles around the rim of the glass to qualify as a 'head'. Leaves some nice legs on the glass as you swirl/drink it. Aroma is chocolate, vanilla, oak and dark fruit and you can truly smell the booze on this. Yum. Taste follows the nose with chocolate up front followed by vanilla sweetness, bourbon and dark fruit into a slightly bitter finish. For a 14% ABV beer the alcohol is well hidden in the taste, probably masked by everything else going on. Taste is big, balanced and complex. Mouthfeel is thick and velvety, just like a great stout should be.    Suggested food pairing: Medium rare prime rib    If you like this beer then you should also try: Black Note Stout    Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely have it again) This beer crushes it. Awesome. With deep, complex and balanced flavors, its reputation is well deserved and it belongs right up there with the other elite stouts (e.g., KBS, BCBS, Black Note). A tough one to find, sure, but definitely worth it if you can.

Subtle vanilla, caramel and lacto sweetness. Mouthfeel is relatively thin, with a nice bourbon bite. Excellent beer, but a little overrated in my opinion. If this had a BCBS similar mouthfeel, it would be on the same level if not better.

They served me this in a tulip and the beer was black and only a small amount of tannish head. Then I smelled this wonderful creation and wow. The bourbon was there in the background but the dark chocolate and raisiny smell from a RIS was there. The taste was even better. Soft vanilla notes throughout to blend the edges of the chocolate, plum, and caramel notes. Then the bourbon and wood from the barrels came through on the finish.

It was a 2015 that had spent most of its time in my "cellar fridge" that I have set at ~50 degrees.    I'm not sure what conditions others have aged this beer in, but it was pretty incredible to me. Not quite on the level of, say, aged 2014 BCBS, but a truly phenomenal BBA stout with notes of chocolate fudge, vanilla, toffee, creme brule, dark fruits and of course sweet oaky bourbon.    I will continue to seek this one out.

LOOK: dark black pour, off white head, lasts long. Touch of cola like transparency on the edges.  AROMA: smokey, oaky, scotch-like.   TASTE: charred oak, toasted barley, touch of earth and mineral,  FEEL: Perfect. Just thick enough to be chewy, thin enough to support excellent carbonation and silky feel.    **  01/14/17  Bottle to snifter, sipping through Seahawks @ Falcons playoff game.    In addition to all of the above....  Dark fruit in the aroma.   Bourbon in the taste, not sure how I missed that initially, probably b/c of scenario my taste buds were a little overwhelmed.    **  04/26/17  Fresh Parabola is the way to go.  14.5% and Smooth.  Quite awesome.    **  04/21/18    '17 vintage on tap at Isaac Newton's. Tasting against 2016 Parabajava. A good day indeed.     Parabajava is better. So much smoother. Coffee flavor is subtle and a nice bonus. Dave thinks it's the vintage (16 better than 17).   **  05/05/18    happy cinco de mayo.    2017 bottle vs. 2018 bottle. both poured to snifter glasses and enjoyed over a few hours.    2018 is much smoother. I feel the h2h with the parabajava is justified in that this 2017 seems to have an abundance of smoke/ash/wood. Don't want to slam boulevard since I really like their beers also; BUT, 2018 and 2016 ares definitely   superior.  **  12/01/18  2018 vintage; bottle to tulip glass.  **

This creation can be very boozy, but not bourbon flavored, and ripped with vanilla overdose. However another bottle or keg can be nectar of the stout gods as well. Different batches drank at different times makes a difference. Was that grammatically correct? To clarify, I might be willing to state, that in my experience, that age in a bottle does not treat this one well, it brings out too much of the sharper alcohol notes, vanilla comes into play more and the subtle oak and chocolates gets lost. IMHO, kegs just get better!     Anyway, the best have been awesome, chocolate, vanilla, wood and the snap and burn of serious alcohol at work here makes it one of my favorites for years. In sum, if you get one in a bottle I recommend drinking it soon, (not that I am following my own advice since I still have a few left!)

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Appearance: dark brown with a dark tan / cocoa-colored head, which fades to a lacing. The beer is bright when held directly to light and resembles Coke.    Aroma: sweet smelling, like flourless chocolate cake. The oak comes through well, contributing vanilla.     Flavor: prominent molasses that fades to oak and vanilla in the finish. Absolutely no alcohol heat or flavor. Several layers of flavor. I see no reference to this beer being bourbon-barrel aged, but there is no bourbon flavor – just the oak components.    Mouthfeel: medium body. I wish this had a bit more body to it. A bomber is certainly a meal by itself, though.    Overall: 4.5 years in the cellar. Good, but far from great. This was rated nearly identical to Bourbon County, which I drank side by side. Bourbon County is far superior. I can’t help being somewhat disappointed. Perhaps it was the extended cellaring and I missed its peak. There are better readily-available imperial stouts.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Had the 2016 Vintage edition, which comes in a nice carton box.  Pours a very nice dark brown colour with medium head and dense texture.  The smell is sweet and bourbon-like.  The taste is very complex, ranging from sweet at first with a hint of scotch, then oak, aged wine, bourbon, vanilla and chocolate and probably other aromas that remain hidden for me still.   This is clearly one of the best beers I've had (along with Devil's Halfacre). For me, it's better than drinking a good cognac.  Absolutely wonderful!  PS: The 2017 version is much weaker than the previous ones. The bottle is also halved.

Slightly dry and slightly bitter finish. Absolutely superb - about as close to a perfect beer as I've had.

I picked up this definition in college. Thinking of parabolas in real-world terms as the trajectory of a ground-launch missile or gravity's rainbow, from a dense high-brow Pynchon novel, I also picked up in college. But my favorite Parabola is this boozy 14% ABV Russian Imperial Stout with its oatmeal taste, and vanilla raisin fragrance. Firestone Walker Brewing Company has concocted a real treat and it was while in college on Spring Break, a break from my studies on Shakespeare, Eisenstein montage, Brando-bravado, D.W. Griffith's racist apologetics, that I and a few thespian friends wandered into this brewery. They have a location in northern and southern california and surprisingly I found myself in the northern one for my first encounter. Drug dealers will tell you expanding your post to multiple areas helps with distribution, helps with profits, so it's no surprise when breweries say this as well. The biggest thing I picked up in college was my fine-tuned tongue for beer (because, and everyone knew, my gifted abilities at acting I already possessed on my first day of college (still had to pay that loan though)). Young and already drunk almost to the point of poisoned, we walked into Firestone Walker and was served the Parabola. On first taste I felt the curvature, starting point then up the y-axis, along the x-axis, seconds later down the y but still along the x. It was an experience. An experience which when I look back I can only recall portions of, like feeble lines striked through, only getting two points of contact, not the whole curve. I and my friends, we drank and drank this beer down and down and when the ambulance arrived to take our unconscious bodies to the ER, we did not cooperate, we were not appreciative. We were young and dumb and didn't understand. But also, we know these medics, fresh out of 6-months of EMT training, did not understand what we did. Which is how good of a beer this was.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I have had this beer multiple times and participated in a flight from 2011 to 2016. Definitely not a beer that ages well as it seems to lose quite a bit with time and you are just left with booze as the predominant taste. Pours a tad thin when young and only gets thinner with age. you can almost always see light passing through around the edges. Smell is always barrel forward and the booze is almost never hidden with strong chocolate notes. The taste tends to follow the most with booze and chocolate. A slight sweetness is present with hints of raisin and the beer often feels tastes fudgey. Vanilla also comes through in the taste. Feel is a tad light for the style, especially if it has some age on it. Overall this is an excellent barrel aged stout that does not hold up well to aging. give it two year max in your cellar; it starts to precipitously degrade after that.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Got on tap in Waltham/Boston area at Bison County restaurant. $11 for what must have been a 8oz pour, which was steep but I don't see this around so I ordered it.    Dark with slight ring of a head. Smell is dark fruit, hops, coffee and chocolate and some booze.     Taste is coffee and bourbon-y (there is that bourbon barrel), toffee, some slight baker's chocolate, sweet fruit (chocolate covered cherries), and also some coffee bite. All the flavors you expect, quite perfectly mat he'd, and not a lot of char or ash which makes it quite pleasant. The heat of the 13% is there but not at all off-putting. (Bottled is apparently 14%?) Sweet esters and warmth, relatively thin mouthful makes this very easy to drink. If it wasn't $11 I'd have had 2.     Very well balanced Russian Stout, the barrel aspect works perfectly here. Firestones tend to be one-note for me, this shows much more nuance and a great drink, better than Old Rasputin in my book.

Has a one finger tan head with good retention. The head left some lacing on the glass.     N: Strong coffee, roasted malts, caramel, toffee, molasses, biscuits, yeast, chocolate, vanilla, wood, citrus, and some floral.    T: Strong roasted malts notes, coffee, caramel, toffee, molasses, a burnt character, yeast, vanilla, wood, citrus, chocolate, and some floral,     M: smooth, creamy, sticky, warming, chewy, and full body.     O: A huge beer the alcohol is fairly hidden with wisp of warming. The beer is seriously balanced well. When I want a thick dark chewy beer this fits the bill so very well. There is nothing short of Amazing. I need to get a couple bottle of this stuff.

Smell is very similar to aged BCBS -- bourbon, booze, dark fruit, bit of dry dog food. Good not great.    Taste is strong roasted grain, bourbon, still some alcohol warmth, cocoa powder. Lingering taste of espresso coffee grounds, sticky noble hop bitterness.    Mouthfeel is rather light, spritzy, drinkable but thin.    Overall, liked it. Didn't like it as much as BCBS or some other BA stout standbys. Appreciated the balancing bitterness and coffee tones, but could use a bit more body if I were to nitpick.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Served on tap in a snifter. Pours a thick, motor oil black with only the faintest traces of a brown/mocha head (a little more would be appreciated though). The nose is pungent and earthy. Bourbon right off the bat is followed by dark fruit (black cherry). The palate accepts the same bourbon-to-cherry intro but these are accented with notes of oak, molasses, and the slightest trace of licorice. I'm unfortunately writing this a day after trying it, so the full spectrum of flavor is fading from memory - this is a beautifully complex Russian Imperial Stout however. Mouthfeel is thick - really thick. This is an unmitigatedly incredible RImpStout.

Pours like used motor oil with thin dirty white head and an inch of lacing into a snifter.Nose is all barrel, bourbon,caramel and sweet malt.  Taste follows with additional flavors of cocoa and dark fruit. Just F...ing delicious. One of my favorite BA brews.

Very nice beer but bourbon and aftertaste is a little overpowering. I'm betting it's better with a year or 2 of age on it. I'll try to find another to sit on.

The smell is Bourbon, vanilla, dark fruits, and dark chocolate.  The taste was amazing. It was 53 degrees out of the fridge and the flavors took off from there. Sweet vanilla, dark fruits, malty, and chocolate. As the stout warmed to room temperature, the sweet dark chocolate came out. The bourbon was very consistent thru out. One of the best I have tasted, next to BCBS and Black Tuesday.

Super dark brown colour    S- Good bourbon     T- Complex. Licorice, chocolate, coffee, bourbon and other spices. Some brown sugar or molasses. Good balance but would enjoy more bourbon.     M- Creamy going down but dries right out afterwards    O- Nice brew. Not great and is a nice to try. Just does not have the depth and thickness I am looking for in a higher priced brew. Don't get me wrong it's good but just for me I know of way better    Food Pairing    As usual with bourbon barrel aged stouts this one is difficult to pair. Sorry but I have to go with the best there is on this one....... Chocolate cake with chocolate icing or brownies. Either or is great!    Enjoy

Bourbon, vanilla oak flavors and a medium amount of sticky caramel sweetness dominate the flavor. There is a moderately-strong hops bitterness and some alcohol as well countering the sweetness making for a beer that somewhat bitter on balance. The finish is slightly sweet with aftertastes of caramel, dark roast, and dried dark fruit.

Amazing color, lacing, complex tastes that just blended incredibly well. Likely my one and only but if I ever see it again I will get it in a heartbeat.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Ive had a fresh 2015 parabola last year and it was unbelievable. This was before I was even into stouts to be honest and nonetheless this absolutely blew my mind. Parabola may be the reason I started getting stouts, in particular bourbon barrel ages stouts.    I had 2012 Parabola a few weeks ago. This thing was probably better than 2015. After 4 or so years of aging this beer lost none of the complexity of a fresh parabola possesses. There was so much going on and it remained drinkable, not hot (alcohol-wise) and absolutely exquisite. This beer is world class for my preference and palate.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Pours dark and rich. Nice head. caramel, mild coconut, vanilla, dark roast coffee, rich dark chocolate, fudge, some dried black cherries and fig, brown bread, some charred oak, can taste the different barrel aging. Exceptional. Very young no aging though. Would be a lot better aged I feel.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 2016 Bottle: Pours pitch black color with a thick foamy 1 finger tan head that faded very slowly and left very good spotty foamy lacing.    Smells of molasses, dark chocolate, tobacco, burnt coffee grinds, caramel, peat moss, brown sugar, bourbon, red wine or a merlot, oaky notes, light piney hops, roasted malts, earthy tones and a malty sweetness that cuts through and lets the bourbon tie it back together. Very complicated and the sweetness is stronger than expected, but tamed by the smoky/earthy notes. The barrel notes are intense and I found it very hard to distinguish any real essence of each spirit barrel used for this blend, but that's what makes it so damn interesting and enjoyable.    Tastes like it smells with molasses, dark chocolate, tobacco, cocoa powder, burnt coffee grinds, caramel, peat moss, toasted coconut, vanilla, brown sugar, bourbon, red wine or a merlot, oaky notes, light piney hops, roasted malts, earthy tones, soy sauce, sherry and a real sweet, syrupy finish that gets better as it warms and only lets a little bit of the ABV through with the extreme complexity of this brew.     Really, really tasty at this stage of the bottle's life, looking forward to trying a well aged bottle to see if it lives up to the hype. A lot smoother than it should be, it's chewy and viscous with a nice heavy body that slides down with ease - incredible ease actually. A smoky and sweet aftertaste lingers with a touch of bourbon, a dash of hoppy bite and a slight bitterness. Excellent at this point, I'm sure it can (and will) only get better. World class indeed.    4/26/2017: Opened a 2012 bottle that I've had since July 2013 and it poured beautifully and left good spotty lacing (moved "Look" score up to 4.25), the aroma releasing a lovely mix of cocoa, bourbon, vanilla, tobacco, molasses, brown sugar, dark chocolate and woody/earthy notes. Raised the "Smell" score to 5 as it was a perfect nose at this point. Tastes thankfully like it smells with a well balanced blend of rich chocolate malts, woody/barrel notes, vanilla and bourbon which masks the ABV and goes down incredibly smooth.     Followed up the 2012 bottle with a 2016 bottle and it was much better aged when compared to the first time I tried the 2016 vintage. This 2016 bottle still had some minor heat but was velvety smooth and had a great feel, proving that age does wonders for this stout. It gave me a new appreciation for this brew so I pushed up the mouthfeel score from 4.75 to 5 as I sipped and savored this brew. Total beer geek moment, but this beer kicks ass when it's aged.    Overall score of 4.76 moved up to 4.86 since these aged versions got so much better tasting and smelling. Exceptional beer, much better aged and a full notch above my first tasting of it last year.    7/21/2018: Opened a 2018 vintage bottle and it was near perfect in every way, naturally getting better as it warmed.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 2014 vintage poured into a snifter. Jose is great, silky bourbon. Taste is bourbon notes on top of a standard stout. Mouthfeel is lacking, it's pretty highly carbed for an imperial stout that has been ages in barrels this long. It's solid but not spectacular and certainly doesn't live up to some of the ratings here compared to its peers. They did a great job with the barrel but the base beer lacks creaminess and or any other complimentary flavors, no chocolate or deep malt here. It's truly just a conduit for the bourbon. Good beer, not great and certainly doesn't belong with its peers in this category.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 First time trying this and I have to say it might be my favorite beer I've ever had. Drank a 2016 Vintage poured into a Teku glass. Pours out a deep burnt toffee color that evolves into a black pool into the glass. Some head develops, but not much. The head slowly lowers, but a minimal amount remains for the remainder of the drink. I'm amazed at the smoothness of this 13.1% ABV beer despite virtually no age on it, and yet, a wonderful booze still floats in the background the entire glass. Aromas of Vanilla, Bourbon, smoked wood, caramel, black licorice, and dark chocolate escape from the glass. Each sip reveals layers of burnt caramel, vanilla bean, bourbon, black licorice, and fresh roasted coffee. The balance and complexity of this beer is rivaled by few beers that I have had. This was somewhat transcendental to drink. Some beers live short of their hype, other beers live up to their hype. This exceeded its hype, which should say enough. Definitely a euphoric drinking experience. I have another bottle that I plan to age for 2 years. I am ecstatic to see what happens.

Some vanilla.     T- A lot going on. Fruity on initial taste, plum and a little dark cherry. A little bitter-sweet with dark chocolate, coffee and caramel. Definitely some oaky booze and something else I can't quite place (coconut?). Well blended.     F- Luxurious feel that coats the mouth. I would like it to be slightly thicker though.     0- A lot of interesting flavors. Slightly boozy, but not overpowering.

Definitely try to get one of these if you haven't yet. Simply awesome.

Overall this a super quality beer, maybe not quite what I expected given the hype however I still extremely enjoyed it. Have another 2016 sitting on my shelf until 2017 so I can rotate, perhaps with age it will blow my mind.

Tastes very bittersweet with bourbon, toffee, caramel, mild coconut, vanilla, dark roast coffee, rich dark chocolate, fudge, some dried black cherries and fig, brown bread, some charred oak, with mild earthy grass.

This beer is very thin for a stout, and with age it gets more thin it seems. I would definately drink these fresh or just a little age. They don't age gracefully.

Taste was near perfect, burbon, chocolate ans black malt, no bitterness or burnt flavors. I did think it was a little hot compared to other years and will sit on a few and try them with the next batches.  My biggest complaint was the mouthfeel, way to thin for a BA stout. Compared it side by side with an Alesmith BA Speedway and the Speedway won hands down on mouthfeel. Actually the concensus was BA Speedway was all round better beer this year.

Nose: massive Barrel character, char, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, coconut, toasted, marshmallow, chocolate, slight dark fruits    Taste: follows the nose perfectly. The barrel character really shines here and is the dominant free in the glass. Coconut, char, bourbon, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, dark fruits, marshmallow. Does not drink like a 13% beer; seems like half that. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy to heavy but with a nice creamy fudge quality.     Overall: clear winner of the night. Paired perfectly with homemade coconut coffee ice cream.

The head slowly melts into the body of the beer with nice lacing throughout the drink. Smells of a conglomeration of everything you want in a stout: chocolate, toffee, brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, etc. However, I'm slightly disappointed thereafter. It's good but not great. Not off the charts great on draft. I'm finding I like beers like this aged at least 6 months on a bottle lately. You get the abv booze rush and ask the flavors above but it's just too young. They haven't melted together as I would have thought. However, these mixture beers are always this way to me unless they have sat on a shelf for some time. Had a bitter subtle kick to it at the end. MORE.watery than I could have possibly expected. Lots of abv burn. Need to try it properly aged at least a year and then revisit it.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Superb. Maybe the most complex beer I've ever had. Definitely top 2 (along with 2014 Alewerks Bourbon Barrel Porter). Funny thing is I've had this beer 3 times before (2012 - 2013 I think?) and didn't like it at all. Amazing.    Pour is beautiful highlighted crimson black. I'll just list the aromas and flavors from this beer. The most interesting was the black cherry halfway thru the bomber, the hint of mint towards the end, and what I'm going to call black hops (yea I just made that up). Hops drenched in black alcohol goodness. Tasty.    Bourbon, whiskey, chocolate, vanilla, oak, barrel. marshmallow, coconut, coffee, black cherry, black licorice, mint, alcohol and black hops. Yea I said all that.    The only (minor) imperfection was a tiny twinge of plastic, fake feeling aftertaste 2/3 of the way thru. But I will not dock the score, this beer was every bit as good as the best barrel aged beers I've had. Only drawback is I can only get one. Question, what would aging this beer do? It's already (obviously) been aged perfectly by the brewer.

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2016 release. Pours a deep dark brown with little to no opacity. Thick and chewy with strong bourbon, chocolate, coffee and cherry backbone. Complex taste with a huge variety of flavor from beginning to end. For 13% it doesn't taste boozey or hot at all. Overall a really great strong beer, very heavy in both taste and alcohol content- definitely made for sipping. Not sure how it compares to previous vintages.

A- Bourbon, espresso, vanilla, chocolate & a hint of smoked oak. T- Bourbon is definitely present but allows the coffee, burnt brown sugar, vanilla and an ever so slight hint of licorice to shine through. F- Medium carbonation and great chewy mouth feel. Alcohol is there but not hot or overpowering. O-Exceptionally balanced blend of flavours that shine through the 14% ABV. Best BBA Stout I've had so far.

The bourbon amount was perfect, but this looks and feels more like a porter than a stout. A good beer, but way overhyped. My mouthfeel wanted more after each sip. Good, yes. Great, not close.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottle.    2016 Edition    A: Rich complex deep grain roast and malt. The roast is reminiscent of coffee and dark chocolate. There is a light malt sweetness, with noticeable bourbon barrel presence.     A: Jet black color, totally opaque with a moderate tan mostly-smooth head that has adequate retention.    T: Deep grain roast; the malt flavor is coffee/dark chocolate-like with a slight sweetness. The beer has a moderately prominent bourbon barrel character with a dry finish.     M: Full bodied with moderate carbonation. There is a bit of an alcoholic warmth that is slightly sharp from the bourbon barrel. However, the beer has a luscious texture (from the oats) and really coats the tongue.     O: Delicious; this beer has a really complex aroma and flavor. The full bodied, deep grain roast is really complimented by the mixture of bourbon barrels used for aging.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2016 Poured from a bomber into 2 snifters (split with my wife).  Look - Pitch black, minimal head. Completely dissipated within a few seconds.   Smell - Very sweet. Lots of big malts, caramel, a bit of vanilla. I didn't get much bourbon at first until it started to warm up.   Taste - pretty much exactly like it smells. The malt character really dominates. It took a while for the additional flavors to come out. I would definitely recommend drinking this beer pretty close to room temperature.   Feel - Great, very creamy.   Overall- still very good, but not quite as good as last year in my opinion. As stated above, I would definitely recommend drinking this beer pretty close to room temperature. The fridge was set to 55 degrees, but it still improved immensely with some additional time on the counter.

Viscosity is perfect. Not too syrupy. Definitely strong hints of Oak in the taste. Strong Coffee flavor with hints of vanilla and caramel. Simply F.A.N.T.A.S.T.I.C. Had the 2016 vintage. Saving one of them to be aged for a couple of years. Can't wait to see how it tastes later.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 A+, 2015 version, just drinking after the 2016 release. I don't even recognize this beer from even when having it fresh a year ago. Holy cow only one year did this good. I was on the fence about about parabola as it tasted like warm syrupy butter with excessive booze heat when I had it first. The one year old age bottle is absurdly good. My mind is boggled what more age could do, good thing I have several more from the last few years. Just have to find that sweet spot.

S-Dark fruit, molasses, chocolate, and of course, bourbon.  T-Follows the aroma with added notes of oak and vaniila.  M-Rich, smooth, and full-bodied.  O-Another excellent addition to the Parabola family. As it warms, it even becomes more complex. Slightly boozy on the back end but will mellow with aging.   Thank you Matt.
