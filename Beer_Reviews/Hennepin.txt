look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Hazy golden-orange with visible effervescence, a creamy white head, good retention, and streaky lacing.  Smells of ripe banana, clove, hay, dried apricot, pear, apple skin, honeydew melon, and toast.  The taste follows the nose. Banana and dried apricot upfront, followed by toast and cracker, apple, pear, lemon, honeydew melon, green grape, hay and clove. A hint of sweetness throughout, but finishes dry and spicy.  The feel is medium-plus-ish, highly carbonated like champagne, providing a prickling and pillowy sensation that quickly rolls across the palate and disappears into dryness.  A sensational American saison! One of the OG American saisons, this stands up to the test of the time. Phenomenal stuff.

The aroma/smell is a fruity pebbles/banana bread mix of slender...  As for taste...it is full with semi dry effervescence along with the fruit/hops on the German/Belgian side...Not much of a saison man myself, but a very nice and un-expected good brew with that complex mix of flavor and aroma. This may have changed my mind on saisons...and also perfect for this time of the New Year with that champagne like feel and semi dryness.  This is a very pleasurable drink...glad I went there.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 This is a really good saison. Quite complex. Primary notes I get from this are fresh peppercorn, honey, melon, exotic spice such as coriander, sweet grain and some yeast-derived dough flavors. Quite dry, which takes away from the drinkability, and the body is on the heavier side it feels. Smooth nevertheless, carbonation is crisp. Overall great beer

Pours hazy medium gold; slightly clouded, highly effervescent body, generating more than two fingers of puffy, pillowy white head comprised of big, soapy bubbles. It falls apart slowly, requiring more than ten minutes to fully dissipate - a patchy cap and fat collar of foam remain, with gobs of messy lace also having been deposited in its wake. Kind of smells like a hefe to me - I'm getting a lot of ripe banana on the nose, with spicy hints of clove, pepper and coriander. Wheaty, grainy, bready pale malt backdrop sweetness, with light hints of lemon/orange peel and orchard fruit providing some added depth.    Quality stuff; ostensibly Belgian in theme, though I think if you gave this to me blindfolded, I'd believe it to be a hefeweizen - its ripe banana esters are the main reason for that notion, while its wheaty, bready malt notes merely reinforce it. Citrusy hints of orange peel and lemon zest rise to the occasion by mid-sip, leading into a spicy, yeasty tail end that includes suggestions of clove, pepper and coriander; clove spice and wheat grain sweetness wrap up the sip before a dry aftertaste. Medium in body, with assertive, prickly carbonation at first, though it does settle down quite a bit throughout the course of the glass, becoming more smooth and soft. While not a factor within the flavour itself, the alcohol does warm the throat/chest just a tad as you sip your way into this one.    Final Grade: 4.16, an A-. Ommegang's Hennepin did not disappoint, but it didn't exactly knock my socks off, either. That is to say, there's nothing out of place here: it's exactly what it needs to be, without going above or beyond in any specific manner. It's a solid beer in and of itself, but it's priced at $10.45 per bottle (in this market) and that seems kinda pricey for what I'm getting. Don't get me wrong - I liked it, and I'd consider buying it again, but I dunno how often I'll be returning to this at that price. In any event, cheers to a fine pick for my 1800th review.

Hazy yellow golden straw color, just hazy straw when held up to light.  Smell is mild and features citrus fruit and grass some yeast and hops with a slight alcohol bite.  Taste has added spice and twinges of funk, sour at first with bitter hops taking over the middle and finish.  Light bodied with ample carbonation, fizzy on the palate with a dry spice finish.  Easy to drink, not overly sour or funky. Nice hop bitterness and sour balance.

Overall, this is a great brew and the 1st Saison style that I've ever tried, definitely want to track down some more.

So I was pouring slowly and no head was forming until all of the sudden and it was gushing over the sides. Left me with a four finger white crown. The beer itself, what's left anyway, is a golden color. Not necessarily clear but can make out my finger on the other side of the glass.   The smell is straw like with notes of lemon. Pretty underwhelming.   The taste of this is is pretty much the same. Lemony and straw like but underwhelming for my liking.   The mouthfeel is probably my favorite part about this brew. It's soft and bubbly, almost like a champagne.   Overall, I expected more from this. It's just pretty average and underwhelming. Balanced and crisp, might be better on a hot summer day.

The beer pours hazy orange yellow with a few floaties and fizzy off white head. Very little head or lacing after 2 minutes. The aroma is very musty (wet basement like) with little else coming through. The taste is rather subdued with some traces of wheat and pils malts and some familiar Belgian yeast character but muted and leaning to the musty side. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very carbonated and dry in the finish. Overall, ok but not what it would be fresh. Did not know where to look for a date on this, but I've had it fresh before and it was great. Rated to the average and will review again when opportunity presents itself.

Lush, creamy smooth feel up front with boozy warmth emerging from the middle to the end. Sweet bready, malty flavors up front with hints of sweet bananas. Light peppery and anise esters follow on the edges and slowly overtake the sweetness. Tart fruitiness in the middle followed by sweet apple, pear and berries. Finished with a tart fruit flavor followed by a mellow sour dough yeastiness and light peppery notes. Flavors and aromas were complex while subtle. A tasty enjoyable beer.

Taste: Much more subdued than the smell. A mild fruitiness and freshness without much hop bitterness until the aftertaste, not unlike a good pale lager. A little citrus. Extremely easy to drink.    Mouthfeel: Thicker than I expected for such a pale beer, almost creamy.    Overall: A very fine beer for a hot summer's day. The smell can be off-putting, but the beer is much more mild than it seems and it would be a good alternative to macrobrew lager.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Man, Hennepin has got to be one of my favorite beers of all time. Definitely one of the best, highly available (at least on the east coast) American Saisons out there. The beer pours a beautiful hazy yellow-gold, with a head so fluffy you could take a nap on it. It smells of pilsner, clove, ginger, orange peel, mulled wine – grandma's spice rack/the old country. In the mouth, the beer develops what's already in the nose: spiced apples, funky citrus, pepper, yeasty dough with lingering hops. This is a creamy liquid dream, an excellent example of the Saison style.

Pours with a generous head with good retention (when done correctly), which helps release the bouquet and enhance the flavor.   Nice and well balanced fruity and floral smell. The effervescence is a little on the higher side; the Golden color is just spot on.   Not as sour as I was expecting (a good thing in my opinion). Citrus flavor with a peach or banana aftertaste (in a good way).  I can’t get any of the ginger out of this one, neither on the smell, nor the taste. but there is no need to go looking for it. This is just as close as it gets to a perfect beer.   Very complex flavor, refreshing, not too bitter.

Strong bitterness throughout.  M: Light bodied with significant carbonation despite rather high ABV for style. Crisp finish.  O: A nice representative of the Saison style. A little drier and more bitter than average, but with a more complex flavor profile and more refreshing than most.

Nice soft clove aroma, generically "Belgian" but fairly muted in aroma.    Soft clove flavors matching the aroma, but quite drying in the finish. Seems quite authentic with the flavor profile.    MF - Fairly light body and big carbonation. Carbonation aids in the drying finish. Again, quite traditional.    Very much in line with Belgian/French Saisons, in terms of being highly carbonated and dry and maybe a little boring. A nice beer, just probably not my favorite style.

A fine example of how a Saison should be. You will notice a good amount of carbonation. The taste is amazing. There is a mild note of fruit that stays on the palate. There is a wonderful white head along with slight lacing. The taste follows the nose and is a lovely blend of clove, Pilsner, fruit, and yeast. I found there to be a great mouthfeel. The champagne-like quality is another element that, when combined with everything else, makes this beer an amazing addition to the Ommegang body of work.

Heavy malt/yeast/grain instead. Alcohol taste is more prominent yet clean and crisp.Very dry finish. Leaves an interesting coating on the palate perhaps this is the ginger doing its magic.     Hennepin saison ale makes for a solid companion to the summer weather. I've come to expect some semi sweet notes on this style of brew.I've only had a handful of examples in this style. My inexperience and sweet tooth,however does not take away any part of the joy I get from sipping on this brew. Overall this is a solid farmhouse ale, just not what I was expecting. Definitely complex.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 It poured a light golden yellow yielding a yellow/orange colored body. A white, foamy, one inch head appeared and slowly died to a film coating the top of the body. A fair amount of carbonation is seen rising. The smell has the coriander and pepper up front. The taste is peppery and crisp yet tart and balances it all out with a slight orange peel-esque-ness coming through. The palate is dry on the aftertaste and finish, some acceptable harshness on the tongue. I’d say this is fairly drinkable. I’d say this isn’t exactly very drinkable. Overall, this is a good saison, different from most I’ve had, but still good.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Love this one! I'm surprised I haven't already rated it, as I've had it several times.    Color is a lovely bright cloudy amber. A normal pour creates a billow of white foamy head that dissipates after a couple of minutes to a thin white covering. Fragrance is pleasant and mild - a bit of flower and grain.    Taste is great. A hint of sweetness, but only a hint. Dry on the finish. Quite refreshing, as is supposed to be the case with a saison, although the ABV can be dangerous if one quaffs the brew quickly. Tingly carbonation - champagne-like. Slightly watery, which works fine as a thirst quencher.    Overall, a fine ale that I pick up whenever I come across it.

Quite a complex range of flavor, there's beery maltiness, some spice with a tripel yeast finish. It's flavorful and yet very much still a beer. Very carbonated and creamy. Well done. The slightest bit of heat on the end.

The slightest wimper of alcohol after the finish.  Feel - Medium body, loads of carbonation, dry. Goes perfect with the taste and makes an incredibly refreshing beer.    Overall - All of the flavors compliment each other extraordinarily well. One of the best beers I've ever had.

There is a considerable amount of yeast in the bottom of the bottle and the brewer even cautions to pour slowly.     S- Yeasty with the scent of wet grass and a slight funkiness.     T- Peppery with a hint of citrus peel pith. Moderately hoppy but balanced and refined with a clean, dry finish.     F- Very effervescent and light on the tongue. A rich full body, very crisp and light.     O- This Saison achieves a nice balance of complexity yet maintains the spirt of simplicity of a true farmhouse ale. One of the best I've had.

Appearance: Pours a cloudy straw with a big white head. Looks great. Terrific saison presentation.    Aroma: Good nose. Grass, funky yeast, citrus/orange rind/lemon, hay, earth.    Taste: Follows nose. Orange rind leads the way and is right on the the edge of overpowering without going over it. Tasty saison. Doesn't quite equal the appearance and nose with the taste, but that's a high bar.    Mouthfeel: Very easy on the palate for such a complex, flavorful beer. Alcohol is noticeable but not painful.    Overall: Excellent saison. Recommended to anyone. Up to the hype, I'd say.

A hint of bitterness, sweetness, and citrus with a unique richness and creaminess that lingers in the back with a dry finish. Ommegang continues to make ales that aspire to be great, and they continue to impress with each style. This is a great saison, but there seems to be a hint of "tripel" here too.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from 750ml, corked bottle conditioned, into a Libbey Snifter Glass.     Look- Nice bottle with instructions on serving and story on back label. Gorgeous honey color with 2 finger head when poured that stays around for a nice time. Little transparency in the glass.    Smell- crisp, notes of orange, ginger and spices.     Taste- Refreshing, not to sweet, not to bitter. Like a mix between a whitbeir and Belgium trippel.     Feel- Nice carbonation, easy going down and good amount of alcohol taste.     Overall- had this beer three times now and love it. Really like Ommegang and is one of my go to for ales. This beer is a real treat with a refreshing taste, lots of carbonation and complex flavor. Easy going down but good amounts of alcohol content. Go Ommegang.

Taste was more wheat than almost any beer I've had which is saying a lot. Alcohol was kinda pronounced. Some citrus in there. Really tastes more like a hefe than a saison. Lacks the dry finish, the levity. This comes off as an imperial hefeweizen. The clove dominates. Format is expensive.     Break out the "overrated" chant.

The taste ahhh - malty and fruity, somewhat smoky, well balanced. Has that definite Belgian yeast note you'd expect in this style and it does not disappoint.

Wet pine, wheat malt character, spices, sweet and sour notes. A hint of peaches.  Feel: Acidic on the tongue upon entry, thick and creamy though the middle, and dry on the throat. The taste is mouth-coating.   Overall: The perfect campfire beer. Smooth, rich, complex, and tasty. It tastes like the earth. The perfect Saison.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a large tulip glass. Pours a hazy golden color that shines beautifully when held to a light, and it has a beautiful pillowy white head about two fingers thick and it lingers well and leaves thick lacing. Smell is of banana, cloves, citrus, and spice, with a touch of grassy hops. Flavor is full of fruity and eatery characteristics from the yeast that pair well with the Coriander and grains of paradise. The flavor finishes with a touch of hops and citrus zest, and slightly dry. Spot on flavors for a saison. Love it! Feel is pillowy smooth with decent body, soft carbonation, and leaves some good flavors on the palate. Overall, this is a fantastic American take on what is easily one of my favorite styles. Ommegang's Dubbel left me wanting more, but this one is spot on!

What I can tell you is that I love Belgian style beers, particularly Farmhouse Ales. When I think of a Farmhouse Ale, this is the beer that comes to mind and the standard by which I judge all others. This is the beer that makes my mouth water in anticipation every time I try a new microbrew Saison and hope it will be comparable.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Looks effernescent moderately pale yellow with decent head. Tastes of Hefeweizen-like banana note, tartness, and refreshing crisp mild hops. Better than Hill Farmstead's Dorothy- it has an edge on complexity and mouthfeel in my opinion. Awesome beer and would not hesitate to have again.

The scent was floral with waifs of fruit. The taste was nicely balanced with potpourri and lemon like fruit. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this was a solid saison.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottle BB 1/20/17. DFH Tulip.    A (5): Pours a slightly hazy light gold with three fingers of frothy, foamy, white head that seems to be lasting forever. Arguably the thickest, longest lasting head I have ever had on any beer, ever. Loads of carbonation streaming up from the sides and bottom of the glass. Lacing is exquisite.     S (4): As soon as I popped the top, I could smell the Belgian phenolics: bubblegum, spice (not clove, but similar), yeast, green banana, candied orange peel (orange peel is really in there, go me!).    T (4): Tricky and deceptive arrival; complex flavors that call you to attention immediately, but I wouldn’t call it bold – this is not Duvel; it is overwhelming and laid-back all at once; slightly malty and phenolic/spicy arrival, turns more phenolic and slightly medicinal on the mid palate (ginger?); goes for a slight funk/dried straw note right at the end, and then bitters to a very smooth, lingering phenol, spice, and hop ending. As was the case with Duvel, I find the hop/clove/alcohol combination to be a bit much as this grows warmer, but it is a really well balanced beer.    M (4.5): Lighter side of midweight, actively carbonated, but not biting. A little residual slickness, but clean and dry overall.    O (4.5): I have seen this beer on the shelves for years and years, and wanted to try it. Now that Ommegang is releasing more things in six packs, I am able to try some of their wares, and I have been impressed with everything that I’ve had. This is excellent, and if I could afford to do so, I would drink this all summer long. 7.7%ABV? You would never guess. This is a deceptively complex yet simple beer; loads of flavor, but eminently refreshing. It reminds me a lot of Duvel, but that, I felt, was overpowering; this is not. And is this ever a beauty to look at and to nose. I’ve only had two other Saisons: the first one I don’t really remember, the second I remember because it was awful. I suppose in this case, the third time was the charm.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours a straw gold, pretty hazy. Leaves a 2 1/2 inch white foamy head that retained pretty well. Left a lot of lacing behind. Smell is forward on the Belgian yeast, followed by cherry, orange, and some apple. Hits the tongue sweet from the malt, followed by fruits similar to the smell. The apple and orange come through clearly, with pear as well. Fruit flavors work well for this saison. Feel is very refreshing. Light, crisp body, with lots of carbonation. Leaves a bubbly finish on the tongue reminiscent of champagne.

Light golden in the glass, was careful with the pour, but there is a good bit of yeast in suspension, but that doesn't bother me. Smells of biscuit, lemon, faintly of ginger.. Taste is initially sweet malt in the beginning, followed up by coriander, faint orange and a hint of ginger heat/or saison spiciness. Beer has a somewhat sharp, spicy dry finish. Mouthfeel is great, carbonation makes it almost champagne like. Great beer, keeping these on hand for when we go out for sushi.

Smells of Belgian yeast, bananas, exotic fruits, and some general herbal spices.     Mouthfeel is light, just according to the style. The bananas and wheat comes through, but otherwise, this is fairly basic.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Known as the king of Farmhouse ales, I had to try this.     Hennepin comes barreling out of the bottle before I got a chance to pour it, with toothpaste-like thick foam, bubbling over and creating a beautiful disaster. When poured, the liquid takes a second or two to get past the foam and then develpps into a perfectly hazy, light mango flesh colored body. The head continues to look like shaving cream mixed with white toothpaste, just absolutely pasty and unrelenting. 100% opacity.     Fresh fruits on the nose with green and white grape, oranges, stone fruits/drupe, cantaloupe, accented with cinnamon and pie spices.     A wheaty-hay character starts it out, followed by a wash of circus peanut, banana split, and yeast. A stale cracker/wet hay malt flavor permeates the profile though, detracting a bit from the experience overall. Some lemon-lime flavored water finishes out the profile. 4 seems too generous and 3.75 seems too low, it's a hard decision.     Feel is crisp, light, and dry like a white whine or champagne. Not bad at all and a great compliment to the style and flavor profile.     Overall, I think this is the first Saison I've had this season, though I may be mistaken. Perhaps I'm not giving it a fair chance, but I thought this was just above average. Not neccesarily bad, but not totally mind-blowing either. Will I have it again? Maybe. Great Divide's Collette and GI's Sophie still reign as king in my book for the Farmhouse Ale.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 5 This ale is a master stroke of taste and marketing. Overall, the only "5" rating I have ever given a brew.    First I want to talk about the marketing. (Besides, Hennepin's 2177 reviews have said everything about taste imaginable.)  So, here is my take based on a few facts and what I hope is informed speculation. Duvel's success made clear the huge potential market for Belgian ales... and how hard it is to distribute in 50 states. Duvel's owner (Moortgat) becomes Ommegang's original and, eventually, controlling investor. Seemingly, Ommegang's strategy was to get the lead in America's market by helping build and tagging along with Duvel's distribution network here. Both grew. (Hennepin, a Belgian missionary, discovered Niagara Falls.) I view Hennepin, the beer, as Moortgat's missionary to help bring Belgians to America.    It also helped that Hennepin tastes great. If you want to review BA's Bros and Top Raters as I did, I find little more I can say except to relay some other experts. However, I will note that the label pictured above is superior to the current one after Duvel's marketing people, I presume, got involved. But, there is no need to judge this gem by its cover.    While MJ's 1999 "Guide" gave Hennepin 3 of 4 stars and called it "fruity, dry counterpart to a Belgian saison", MJ gets wildly enthusiastic on page 416 of his "Great Beers of Belgium" and even compares it to the classic Saison Dupont.    Oliver Garrett's calls Hennepin "Ommegang's finest creation" (page 197 "Brewmaster's Table") and talks about how its sweet and sour center makes it an excellent accompaniment to food.     These two generations of beer's master writers agree. So 2177 reviewers and one of BA's highest rated saisons must all be correct !    Collectively, Hennepin is a master stroke on a mission.

Crisp mouthfeel and moderate carbonation? Of course.    Damn this is a good beer. I like it so much that I got a 1/6 barrel for my kegerator today.

Light farmhouse funk on the nose; straw, must and light skunk, going hand in hand with banana, bread, bubblegum and spice.    Orange peel, lemon rind, papaya, banana + peel, coconut, lemon candy, apple, pear, cracker, bread, Belgian yeast, pine, earth, clove, coriander, peppercorn, ginger. Floral and herby. Medium bodied, slightly astringent, earthy, crisp and refreshing. Would pair great with a proper meal. Exceptional saison, just needs that "it" factor.

Needless to say that the carbonation is great, leading to a nice champagne pop when opening. Cloudy amber in the glass with a decent amount of sediment.         -Nose: All yeasty and bready brings me back to the champagne comparison. Reeks of bananas and orange peel with a slight bit of hoppiness.        -Flavor: Great creamy mouthfeel. Orange peel, rye bread, with a decent amount of hops. A bit of petrol on the backend. Great finish but it doesn’t linger        -Rating: 4/5: This is a really good saison. Light and refreshing with a great mouthfeel. Just what one needs for a nice Spring day drinking session. I could knock back a few pints of this guy. Just a really balanced beer. The yeast in the brew balances really nicely with the extras they added.         -Cheers!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Transparent gold color with a huge, fluffy, white head that lasts the entire glass and leaves tons of lacing. Smell is cloves, banana, lemon, pear, and just a general earthiness. Taste expands on the above flavors into an overall fruity and spicy beer; in addition to what I picked up in the smell, there's also coriander, orange peel, banana, and wheat. Very complex balance between sweet, spicy, and bitter. Feel is full and rich, somewhat high carbonation that makes it feel pleasantly prickly on the tongue. Starts out sweet and spicy, finishes somewhat dry and tart. My first time enjoying a saison and I will definitely be seeking out more thanks to this quality brew.

Had a little too much, large foamy white head and carbonation.   This is a wonderful representation though as to what a high quality farmhouse saison should be like.   Love it!

Smell: Banana peels, apples, coriander, fruity esters, something floral.    Taste: Very floral. Flower petals. Bananas. Lemongrass. Cloves. Overall, the bananas and the floral notes probably stand out the most, but it does have a well-rounded flavor for a beer of this style (even if it is on the fruity side), and the alcohol is hidden quite well.    Feel: Bubbly, sharp, and refreshing.    Overall: While it's not my favorite farmhouse ale, it's still a very good one. This style seems to waver quite a bit and this one I believe borders closer to a wheat ale or a hefeweizen more than other saison's do.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This is a very tasty farmhouse saison, and possibly one of the best ones I have tried lately. It was a delicious brew that was full-bodied and had some wonderful notes of orange peel, sweet malt and just a touch of ginger and coriander on the finish. A persistent large foamy white head and the carbonation was spot on for this beer. This is a wonderful representation as to what a high quality farmhouse saison should be like. Two thumbs up!

Nice color and fragrance. A lot of fruit notes and finishes with a nice tart note. I freaking love this beer and will definitely revisit it.    A lot of fruit notes going on at once, complex but incredibly quaff-able. Nice alcohol content without tasting boozy.

The nose has a sour band smell (which is a lot nicer than that sounds). The taste keeps the fruit flavor but brings in a malty yeasty finish which is quite lovely. Well carbonated so refreshing and drinkable (I am partial to carbonation). Overall, it is an outstanding beer, however, the 7.7% ABV (which you don't really notice) would have made it hard to return to the fields for more work after a well earned lunch.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A- Impressive looking cork top bottle that is heavy and of substance....a masculine brew for sure! The beer is champagne like in bubbly goodness and the head is an off white, two finger thick foamy layer over the brew itself....it retains quite nicely and gets rather puffy. Beautiful coloring too....yeast hazed golden/copper, and there is some dead yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle too....nothing but good stuff happening appearance wise!    S- Velvety soft spices that remind me of clove, coriander and slight black pepper right off the bat, followed by mellow fruitiness (pears, pink lady/gala apple, soft citrus and notes of banana), yeasty buttery biscuit....finish seems somewhat dry.    T- The banana fruit flavor comes to life even more than the aromas let on, with the pear and apple/citrus notes now taking more of the back seat. Balancing light smooth malt sweetness that is slightly toasty and grainy/grassy cleanliness! The finish is slighty hoppy, and this becomes much more noticeable after the swallow when the back of the palate gets a tart/bitter floral tone. The spiciness is quite muted but detectable overall...just mild pepper and clove of note!    M/O- Very pleasant on the palate, and while there is a boatload of bubbly zing, it really allows the full expression of the mellow, balanced flavors to shine. Very well hidden alcohol and the beer will age well, as I have found out (BB or bottled July 2013)....this is a highly drinkable and social brew that could be enjoyed on many a night by and sort of club meeting or perhaps with a good meal! Prost!!!

Smell is dry and slightly funky. Taste is heavy on wheat and is dry with some wheat-beer bubblegum flavors. Slightly chalky on the finish, which I find to be nicely unique. Bubbly, light-to-medium mouthfeel. A good saison that is big on spiciness rather than sweetness or bitterness. I enjoyed it. Not Ommegang's best but worth seeking out.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 This was poured into a tulip.  The appearance was a light gold color with a big rocky white foamy head that takes a while to dissipate.  Once it does, speckled lacing clings to the glass and eventually slides.  The smell starts off with a rustic spicy peppercorn aroma running into some tart apples.  The taste was rustic with a tad of funk, slight spice slides in and brings in a light citrusy fruity balance.  It finishes semi-dry.  The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with some carbonation hitting on my tongue just a bit more than expected. Peppercorn spice does hit my tongue appropriately.  Overall, though I love Hennepin and how it also makes a great food beer, somehow, I tend to lean to Tank 7 as a quick go to when I can find it.

S: Rustic, vibrant, strong, and spicy…superb. Smells of Granny Smith apples, some pears, and black peppercorn, with lots of noble hop aromas. Also has a leathery component but in the best possible way. This is what a saison should smell like.    T: Rustic yet refined. A bit more bitterness than most saisons, with noble hop taste throughout, which does not linger much on the palate. Slightly fruit notes than the nose, but plenty of apples, spice and leather. Has a touch of sweetness that brings out some of the fruit-like flavors and finishes semi-dry.    F: Medium body with lots of carbonation. Slick mouthfeel. Tremendously drinkable.    O: This is what beer is all about. Every aspect of this beer is superb and complex. Ommegang’s Hennepin is a gem.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This was poured into a tulip.  The appearance was a soft hazy bronzed orange color with a one and a half finger-ed white foamy head that dissipated within less than about a minute. Trickling semi-foamy lacing stuck around the glass.  The smell had a nice sweet Belgian bready yet delicate citrus fruitiness and then highlights of a light peppery spice rolling in for the balance.  The taste was balanced very nicely between the breadiness, the citrus fruits, and then the spice all blending nice and sweet to spicy. A light fruity to spicy character shows its face in the aftertaste and it leaves a sweet fruity finish.  The mouthfeel is about a light to medium in body with a nice sessionability with this one. Crisp carbonation leads the way but isn't burdonsome as it is there, but allows the sweetness of the blended flavors to be somewhat wet yet slightly clingy, nicely done.  Overall, this was an extremely well done saison, so glad to have tried it and am looking forward to having again.

S - A beautiful blend of spices and herbs. Lemongrass, pepper, clove and minor citrus notes. Not overwhelming but very pleasant aroma all in all - floral and spiced.    L - A well done and fairly spot on saison. Lives up to the aromas detected; most dominate flavors are lemongrass and clove. Floral- mildly sweet aftertaste followed but that of spices such as pepper. Very light tasting beer in a good way.    M - Crisp/sharp beer that's fairly carbonated. Medium bodied. Very drinkable; aftertaste is a little harsh but mute.    O - A pretty amazing beer overall. Very drinkable and well defined with a lot to offer. Enjoyed and will enjoy again sometime in the future!

Pours a beautiful, hazy lemonade yellow, with a frothy white head that sticks around and leaves big lace on the glass. Aroma is classic saison - yeasty, bready, a little lemon citrus. Taste is also classic saison. This is a wonderful, easy drinking, approachable saison. Mouth is smooth, creamy, medium-body - really good. Overall, I really loved this one - on par or possibly even better to me than Saison Dupont.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a tulip.    A - Poured a slightly golden straw. Big, fluffy, white head.    S - Lemongrass, phenols, bready grains, seeds, pepper.    T - The slippery, complex yeast character hits right on the front. The subtle earthiness quickly dissipates as the bright, bready malt notes become more apparent. The yeast gets increasingly fruity and crisp as the citrus takes hold, with a bright, peppery finish.    M - Medium-light body, perfectly crisp yet delicate carbonation, and very slight dryness.    O - One of the best non-tart saisons I've ever had. Incredibly refreshing and loaded with subtle flavors.

S: Citrus notes like lemon and orange dominate the nose, with mild inkings of some spices, bready malt, and a bit of yeast    T: I would dare to say a lemon tart like taste on the nose, that fades into a bit more of a malt flavor, with spices rounding out at the end.    F: Fairly light and refreshing, has a crisp, dry finish similar to champagne.    O: A delicious Saison from Ommegang. Obviously, each brewery has their own take on every style, and I like the almost citrus pastry flavor that this beer offers, but as you sip, it grows in complexity, a job well done.

Very hazy and has tiny sediment that can be seen floating throughout the beer. Leaves decent tracing sporadically. Aroma is yeast, lemon, orange peel, and grass up front, also contains spice. The flavor matches up with the aroma and adds a certain sweetness to the mix. I would agree with some others that there is a champagne type feel to the finish, really broad and distinct overall. Refreshing and easy to drink, just a really good brew.    I've been becoming a pretty big saison fan and this beer is easily one of the best I've had to date.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a TeKu glass. Appearance is an opaque dark yellow with a luxurious white head of long-lasting foam. Picked up the aromas of orange peel and coriander right away. Taste is what you would expect from a farmhouse saison, with quite a bit of intensity from the spices and orange. Nicely balanced. I have come to appreciate this style, and Hennepin exemplifies it very well.

Bottle conditioned - Yellow/Gold color with a creamy head - Head stays intact   Yeast comes through in the nose with biscuit and floral highlights - the yeast strain is the dominant contributor to the nose.  The mouth feel is light in body with a bright and crisp finish - very refreshing  taste starts with a little bit of a citrus quality and moves seamlessly into a spice quality. It finishes with a slight sourness that is very pleasant and gives the beer a dry quality.

Pours golden with lasting, dense white top. Aromas of fruit, spice, and lemon. Similar in flavor, but with more of the witbier character. I've enjoyed better wheats, so while this is good, and tasty, and great looking.... it doesn't strike me as outstanding.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Look: The body is gold and has a one-finger head which quickly recedes to a thin layer of white foam.    Smell: The nose offered notes of toned-down lemon juice. Expect no funky smell.    Taste: The palate matches the nose right off the glass like many North American Saisons. Then, it shifts quickly to notes of Belgian spices which are milder than those found in the back-end of a witbier. As a result of that, Hennepin is not aggressive on our tongue and is very drinkable.    Feel: Like any saison, be it from Belgium or North America, this beer is refreshing. Moreover, we do not feel a crispness that might blur the lines between a saison, a radler or a lemonade. This last detail is a plus.    Overall: This beer is a simple textbook North American saison. Although it is stylistically anonymous because of its simple notes of lemon on the front-end, its simplicity actually makes its charm. The only reservation I have with Hennepin as well as other North American saisons has to do with the head retention. Sure, the beer has a nice lacings, but it can't match other Belgian saisons, which mostly manage to keep a half-a-finger head during a tasting session. Despite this flaw, I would drink this very often during summer.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Appearance: Pours a cloudy straw-color with an absolutely massive, bubbly head. The head might be my one complaint about the beer, though. As I find it necessary to pour extremely carefully or it's almost inevitable that the beer will bubble over.    Smell: The Belgian funk is readily apparent. Smells primarily grassy, but hints of fruitiness round it out quite nicely.    Taste: Like the smell, funky grassiness is the primary taste. Hints of citrus and spice dance about the edges, and though there's not much hop bitterness they do leave some floral notes that linger after the swallow.    Mouthfeel: Light, with carbonation that dances and tingles pleasantly across your tongue.    Overall: An impressive Saison, not as harsh as some I've had and very drinkable. I find myself particularly fond of how the few citrus and spicy notes seem to complement the grassiness just perfectly. Undoubtedly a great beer that deserves its reputation.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Re-review. 12 oz bottle into a teku.    Appearance: Pours a cloudy (as it should be, damnit) straw color. The head is a billion fingers high and white in shade. What's worse, the head is both incredibly fluffy and long-lasting. Some lacing sticks to the glass, too. If someone asked me what the stereotypical saison SHOULD look like, I'd point them to this. I've sort of becomes attached to the theory that a beer's aesthetics are mutually exclusive to how it will taste; with this, I simply can't wait to drink it. (4.5)    Smell: It's like, every single note I expect from a standard (non-brett) saison is here and in full force. I really pick up massive notes of black pepper and grass, along with some mild apple and pear notes. As it opens up, I also pick up some sesame seed. This takes a lot of elements from a witbier, too - the coriander is particularly strong (yet doesn't devolve into Underwood deviled ham like some coriander-laden beers can). It takes all the good elements from a saison and a witbier, and creates something that smells killer. (4.25)    Taste: I get some saison spice initially. From first sip, I can easily tell there's a lot going on here. As the notes of black pepper, fresh-cut grass, and sesame seed gently subside, I start to pick up notes of coriander, candied sugar, and lemon. Of course, I also have to mention the ester flavors: the apple, pear, and white grape notes really sing on the palate. The finish brings back some grassiness. Why the hell didn't I revisit this one sooner?! (4.25)    Mouthfeel: This is refreshing yet decently substantial, like a saison should be. If there's one complaint about this beer, just one complaint, is that it's a bit too sweet at times. Whatever, it's 7.7% and doesn't have brett to eat away at the residual sugar, so I'm peachy. Carbonation is moderate yet mouth-filling. (4)    Overall: This is a classic for a reason. It drinks like an archetypal saison, yet adds just enough witbier elements to make it even more interesting (instead of detracting). This is what happens when you search for the latest and greatest saisons: you ignore stuff like this that's on the shelf 24/7, and come to regret it when you finally decide to pick it up again a couple years later. No more, I'm going to be buying a lot more of this in the future. (4.25)    4.24/5: I could just buy this and Dupont in lieu of all other non-brett saisons and not feel like I'm missing anything

Loved this early this summer when having it for the first time. Still like it, but not as much as before. Could use a bit more funkiness and I find it somewhat heavy and sticky feeling. Prefer Goose Island Sophie, Saison Dupont and, probably, Great Divide Collette.

look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 This brew pours a cloudy yellow/straw color with a fluffy two finger head which lasts until the end. Good lacing, almost worthy of a Pale Ale, and high carbonation.     The smell is bubble gum and spices. The grains of paradise as well as the advertised corriander can be detected. There is also a fruity smell, (pears? and maybe a hint of banana as the brew warms up), as well as a floral smell. There is also a musty wet straw/wet hay smell lurking just beneath the surface along with sweet malts.    The taste is sweet with a very sweet berry like, bubble gum taste along with lots of sweet wheat. The spices tickle the palette then the sweet, creamy wheat taste comes in. There is just a tiny amount of light spicy hops on the backend. The feel is creamy and the beer goes down smoothly.    Overall this close to the perfect hot day/summer beer.

Strongest notes in the nose are of a fruity, estery nature, with plenty of belgian yeastiness. Banana may be the most dominant of those notes. Lingering non-sweet esteriness. An excellent flavor; expertly balanced between sweet fruit, mild pepper spice, and a warmer earthiness. Hides the 7.7 ABV well, perhaps dangerously so!    Overall that is a damn fine saison. For me, it's this and Tank 7 as the best American saisons. But there's always more to try!

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 750ml cork and cage into a stemmed pilsner, the beer is a hazy, almost opaque, lemon yellow coloring with a fluffy, clingy, bright white head. Aromas of toasted grains, lemon grass, bubble gum, subtle honey notes, clove, all spice, grains of paradise, ginger, and subtle funky yeast notes. Balanced and enticing. The flavors are grassy and funky forward, with notes of bubble gum, apple, lemon grass, orange rind, subtle hops bitterness, berry sweet, and a plethora of herb and spice notes. Smooth and light in mouth, with a bubbly effervescence throughout. The beer has an herbal and spiced aftertaste, with a smooth, light, frothy finish. Very refreshing and extremely drinkable.

The taste is tart with lemon, orange peel, and abundant spiciness. The finish is fairly bitter. This beer is highly carbonated and I agree with others' comparison to champagne. Overall, this is a delightful saison: dry but quite flavorful. It's a nice summertime beer and I look forward to enjoying it again.

Like a clove and toasted malts. The taste was smooth and citrusy. It had smoky malt notes and earthy flavors. The alcohol bite was noticeable, yet it was very clean and refreshing on the mouthfeel. This is a very good beer for the style. I think it was very complex and made me taste something different with almost every sip.

Feel: Light-medium body, light carbonation "explodes" in the mouth - effervescent	    Overall: A light, highly drinkable beer with nice complexity and depth of flavor. Very refreshing, but with the higher ABV it sneaks up on you.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Sharp yeast / grain aroma, followed with the expected earthy malt / grassy taste, with some plain cracker and citrus on the backburner. Not an inventive saison, but delivers the goods and has very little to fault.

Okay, maybe I'm confusing this beer with a Disney song. But this beauty simply soars. Pale sunset russet on the eye with creamy head buoyant enough to bear fair Aphrodite on its delicate foam. Champange on the nose, but something else too.....something stinky like a soft ripened cheese, but also heavily citrus. Teasingly effervescent with bubbles bursting like ripe muscat grapes on the palate. And then an unexpected aromatic twist--a faintly metallic tang. Light on the tongue, creamy, well done spices. A breathtaking achievement from Cooperstown. Please, Sir, may I have another?

Sunny golden color, great clarity, three fingers of large-bubbled and rocky white head. Great retention.    S: Yeasty and spicy. Peppery, orange peel, ginger. Powdery yeast is pervasive. Slight medicinal/clove scent. Some oily, grassy, and herbal hops. Grainy and toasty malts.     T: Yeasty up front. Powdery and musty. Ginger and a peppery zing cut through. Some sweet and oily orange peel. Spicy and oily hops. Lemony. Pithy and herbal at times too. Hints of alcohol. A tad medicinal. Tropical esters. Very dry. Bone dry and herbal finish.    M: Light bodied. High attenuation. Frothy and airy feel. Deeply crisp with acutely prickling carbonation.    O: An outside the box take on a saison. It's big and it's spiced liberally. The ginger, coriander, and orange peel are all noticeable. It hides its potency easily, and the dryness and crispness of it make it very refreshing and easy to drink. Perfectly balanced too. A standout brew. Ommegang' recommended pairings are sushi and Asian dishes. This is spot on.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Appearance: A slightly hazy gold, with carbonation still very visible through the haze. It poured with a beautiful 2 and a half finger head that retained very well throughout.    Smell: Very clearly a Belgian. Lots of spice and flora on the nose, and very inviting.    Taste: Delicious. A very well-balanced saison, combining the spiciness of the Belgian yeast with light citrus notes (mandarin oranges) and a nice dry finish.    Fell: Very well-carbonated and easy to drink. The moderate ABV level is well-hidden by the complex yet approachable flavors presented in the beer.    A delicious example of an American saison. Very easy to drink, yet still complex enough to provide you something to mull over if yo want to.

Pale, semiclear golden color beer. Excellent head retention and sexy lacing.    s: I started to smell this beer as it poured...a spicy honey and muted grain aroma.    t: Lots of different flavors here...reminds me of a convalescent. Lemon, honey and clove with just enough alcohol and a peppery nuttiness finishes.    mf: A little more than medium in body with yeast bits as I let some in the pour. Very smooth with good carbonation.    o: A very complex brew. And a very nice beer to go with homemade pretzels. And a good reason to break out the crystal.

A well done saison, alcohol came through a bit more than I prefer, but still quite tasty.

Still learning saisons, but this is a very specific but delicious and refreshing beer nonetheless.

A - Slightly cloudy bright golden almost orange. Cloudy with a huge pillowy white head with good lacing.    S - Initially the Belgian phenolic is strong but accompanied by a light grainy and sweet aroma. There is some lemon and vanilla also trying to mix together. The high carbonation also makes it seem like a tart champagne.     T - Pretty soft and complex flavors with the Belgian clove character up front. Also has subtle hints of spice and light lemon tartness that come through. There's a sweet malty/grain flavor that sits in the middle of the palate. The finish is clean and a Belgian tone that is pretty tasty.    M - Light mouth-feel. Has light carbonation. light body make this brew refreshing with a soft finish that is balanced.     Overall, this is the best Saison I've ever had. Definitely not my favorite style but it is very drinkable and is a great segway beer into autumn from a summer of drinking session IPAs and summer shandys. I wouldn't try to clone it and not in my top 50 but if you like Belgian beers I would definitely recommend this one.    Glass- Chalice

Atop sat a 2-finger white fluffy head that had good staying power and formed numerous collars of foam while consuming. Fine carbonation bubbles rushed to the top - champagne like.    The nose is fruity, peppery and yeasty. The taste is of light fruit; orange peel, candy sugar, spicy and peppery. Mouth feel is creamy with fizzy carbonation that tickles the palate. The ale finishes a little dry.    Hennepin is very drinkable and a fine brew from a top shelf brewer Ommegang.

Alcohol is hidden, and gives depth to the beer. Heavy carbonation.  M: Medium. Carbonated.  O: Reminds me of a blue moon, but much better. Spicy and flavorful. Will definitely get again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 A - The golden body is clear, with extensive carbonation forming into a swirl of bubbles and movement. The head is huge, white and tight, breaking down slowly to a cap that remains. Lacing is present and robust.    S - The nose is of white grapes and limestone, with a spicy peppery kick. Undertones of lemon and acidity.    T - Like the nose, the grape is the primary fruit note, but we also get apples and lemons, too. The middle offers some sweetness, honey and spices. The close offers the minerality, a touch of earth and stone, along with a subtle sweet note and continued lemony sourness.    M - Carbonation, though visible, is mild on the tongue. The dryness in the close keeps the sweetness earlier from taxing the palate. The result is a very pleasant feel that is extraordinary for the taste and ABV.    O - This is an exceptionally well crafted farmhouse ale, that uses its yeast and malt to good advantage. Ranks among the best brewed on this side of the Atlantic, and remains quite approachable.

Until I find one to better it, the Hennepin is my new go-to saison

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Pours a hazy golden color, two finger tall fluffy but fast fading off-white head settles to a thin ring, trails a few streaks of lace down the glass. Smell: pear, pepper, lightly grassy and lemony, with notes of unripe banana and something a bit oddly vegetal (like sprouting garlic). Checking the label I've never realized how many extras they throw in... don't see any expected offenders, but there is that odd out of place note. Taste: boozed ripe pear, mild whole-grain-bread graininess, lemon peel, significantly peppery with some really mild orange-ginger mix in the finish. Initially slick then fast growing carbonation hits, gets to be a little too much, then fades slowly into a crisp-ish but not dry, and slightly sticky, finish. Packaged 3/14, best by 3/16. This was my first "saison" many years ago and it's definitely an enjoyable beer... throttle up the gravity a bit and it's a killer BSPA... but for the style it advertises it's not great, and very reliant on the adjuncts.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Even the beers from Ommegang that aren't outstanding are still worlds better than the same brews from a lot of other brewers. Ommegang just brews with magic, and the Hennepin is evidence of that: pretty pale color, fruitful, but not too sweet taste, and a smooth finish. Great beer.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Best Belgian-style beer for the Price!    Appearance is a hazy yellow-orange color. Ample carbonation that matches the style perfectly. Beautiful fluffy white head that clings to the glass and stays throughout consumption.     Aroma is hits of the yeast with some alcohol presence up front. A major contribution from the yeast that gives it an almost bready smell (as in the yeasty-bread dough before it is baked). Definitely spicy peppercorn with some citrus notes of mainly lemon and orange.     Taste is excellent. Immediately hit with spiciness and yeastiness. I get some of the orange peel and coriander, however not much of the other labeled ingredients. Some nice flavors of lemon juice and zest with a touch of lime zest in the mid palate as well. A moderate amount of classic pepperiness with some biscuity notes. Totally complex!!! At the end a very mild kiss of hops makes the beer incredibly balanced and drinkable. The beers carbonation allows the beer to be extremely refreshing.     For about 3 dollars a bottle, this beer is cheap in comparison to other Belgian beers (normally 5 and up), however it doesn’t lack in complexity and character. It is owned by the same company that produces beers like Duvel (another favorite) and Achouffe, so that’s another perk of known quality! This would go well with many different food pairings. I think pairing this beer with something equally spicy would work well such as some excellent cured meats like hot coppa or soppressata. Again, for the price, this beer is my go to! The only thing that isn't perfect is that as the beer warms up it gains a slightly more present alcohol hit (amplified by the flavor of raw ginger) that detracts from all of the other great flavors. It isn't terrible, however, I did have to mark it down for that reason. However, I still give it 98/100 points!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours a light golden color with an impressive soapy head. Amazing thick lace retains throughout.  At first there is an earthy and barnyard like aroma, kind of like hay. Later, there is a strong fruity and citric like aroma.   A fruity taste predominates at first; sweet but also slightly tart. It reminds me of green grapes; like a white wine. There is a hoppy, herbal and dry finish that leaves a bitter aftertaste. The feel is medium/light bodied. It is very easy to drink and fantastic with meals.  I really loved this one. Excellent overall!

Very rich aromas with floral and citrus hints including ginger and spice. Serve into a snifter and enjoy on any occasion, typically a warm summer day or next to the fire.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 A: Pours a hazy, straw gold color, with an off-white, creamy, three finger head, (very) good retention.   S: Immediate apple, and general estery quality, with some subtle clove, with a pleasant suggestion of biscuity malt, and subtle, clean, hop presence  T: immediate yeast and clean bready note, with a subtle suggestion of citrus/grapefruit, there is a peppery quality here as well along with what can only be describe as just the right amount of hop bite, I get the suggestion of white pepper though I'll admit it is less present here than in other saisons, despite the complexity of the flavor profile, I find overall this is a very crisp beer (this (along with the yeast) to me seems to define it). There is a somewhat floral tartness here but it does not overwhelm. This beer's yeast definitely comes out more as it sits.  M: it is dry, but it certainly coats the tongue in something of a resinous way  O: probably the best of the more traditional american saisons that I've had, it is truly a fantastic beer and a credit to our contemporary definition of the style. I think it is easily the best year round beer that Ommegang makes, though they make their fair share of fine beers, many of which are sorely under-considered due to their availability

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Love this saison, first of I ever had and I keep going back to it. For this review, poured from 12 Oz bottle to glass. Produced as much foam as body and had to wait a bit to pour the rest. Color is deep yellow and clear, with lots of effervescent carbonation streaming to the surface. Aroma is Floral and fruity, and belies the Belgian yeast. Taste is fruity and spicy, with orange rind, pear, white grape, and coriander all found within. Some earthy and floral flavors. Feel is light, and champagne-like.   
Andyrectenwald 
Golden amber with a generous white frothy head that lasts a long time. Fresh bakery bread aroma with pepper and slight citrus, lemon. Taste is mostly fresh bread with after notes of fresh spice, lemon and pepper. Just like the aroma suggests. Nice bitterness at the back of the tongue that stays for a long time. Recommended!
