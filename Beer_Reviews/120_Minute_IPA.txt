look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Looks...dense! Burnt orange color, small head turning into.lacing around the edge of the glass. Opaque with some hop particulate settling at glass's bottom. Smell is unique. Citrus, alcohol and malt combining to give an almost coffe-like aroma. Taste is something else. Almost like eating under-rippened citrus that's been marinated in alcohol. It's got enough malt backing to make it work though. The alcohol hits first, then the citrus and pine shine bright, follwed by a nice bitter taste that really wipes the palate clean. Feel is medium bodied, maybe even a bit full as the carbonation is tight and refreshing. Leaves a nice hoppy aftertaste that leaves you wanting another sip. Overall, not what I expected! I enjoyed this beer a lot but wow! Have to take it slow...the alcohol gives quite a kick. Not as florally hoppy as I thought it would be, and that works really well for this beer.

Aroma is boozy apricot and peach with a bready malt.    Flavors are led by alcohol, yeasty, maybe sourdough bread, and stone fruits. The bitterness climbs up my olfactory while sipping.    Mouthfeel is soft, full and almost chewy with a sticky finish. Warmth builds in the throat and chest.    Overall wow. Beer, huh?   
look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Bottled March 2018    Burnt orange, approaching umber in shade, nothing visible in suspension, scant cream head which stubbornly remains as a complete ring and surface continent. Lively full curtains of lacing.  Heady full aromas of citrus, earthy pine, malt, alcohol, even light florals.  Wonderful cascade of flavors across the tongue! Sweet malt, pIne, melon, toffee, apricot. Definite alcohol burn in the back of the mouth.   Smooth mouth feel at first, then bitterness and the alcohol accumulate. Residual slickness and yeasty aftertaste.  Glad I saved this for a quiet interlude when I could appreciate all the flavors and aroma. Amazing beer well worth the cost.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 appearance: a bright hazy orange with a fairly small tan head. head very quickly becomes a gentle ring around the edge.     smell: very strong resin, dankness, and pine. at the same time, there's a subtle hint of sweetness, almost like a gentle molasses.     taste: some almost toffee-like flavors take over the back end, while a very nice juicy pine holds the front. the flavors blend together very well. there's a gentle maltiness to hold all of it together. a bit of an alcoholic kick but not nearly as much as you'd expect from a beer this strong.    feel: very thick, creamy, and smooth. absolutely wonderful.    overall: i've been putting off buying this due to its price, but i'm very happy that i got some. it has the feel and qualities of a russian imperial stout: big, bold flavors and a thick velvety mouthfeel, but it tastes like an ipa. very high quality beer, dogfish head never ceases to amaze me.

I've had the 60-minute and wasn't much impressed, I've had the 90-minute and loved it, I have a bottle of their 75-minute yet to partake, but this 120-minute IPA lives up to all the hype (and then) some in my book. From the moment you pour it out of the bottle and inspect to that next moment up to your nose, and then the subsequent step of bringing it up to your lips, the whole thing just impresses and surprises one step after the other. A dark orange colored brew with weak foam but some lacing to mention gives way to a uniquely smelling IPA - what I consider and almost perfect blend between the juicy smell one expects and the bitter touch of those hops. Mouthfeel is cream - creamy I tell you! - and that's something I've never experienced with an IPA. And then there's the taste - as unique if not more so to the smell - lightly sweet, incredibly juicy, and at just the right amount of bitter flavor makes this superb. I can see now why people in my circles go ape-shit over this - and I can tell you whenever I can grab one (or two) to take home I will...

Brown, hazy and low carb.    Nose is booze and more booze. Murkey earthy bitter moss. Orange mushrooms in autumn. Wet compacted oak leaves that have been on the ground for months.    Wow. Taste is out of this world. Rich sweet malt at first but quickly turning bitter. Long decomposed hops. The hop acids have been crushed down to mellow florals. Dried orange and figs. Dried apricots. Salty with a touch of molasses.    Silky smooth up front the gives way to a puckering bitterness. Lovely mix of sweet and sour. Spicy and smooth.    Like nothing I've ever had before and that is saying something. The ipa of barley wines. Not the beer for every occasion, but a fascinating l brew. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Fresh 2018 bottling.    Pours a nice hazy orange, looks very good in the glass. Not much head, but that may be due to this bottle being very cold upon the pour. I let it warm for a few minutes before drinking. What is there is leaving a lot of lacing on the glass as it moves down.    Smell is very heavy on citrus, especially blood orange and pineapple, doubling up on pine tree hoppiness and sweet malt as well. The alcohol is also prevalent, almost like a very sweet liqueur.    Tastes just like it smells. Very citrusy, I feel like I bit into a blood orange with that mix of bitter and sweet along with a lot of hop resin. Lots of alcohol, which becomes more forward as it warms in the glass.     Mouthfeel is oily and slick, the hop resin oilslick makes the high alcohol and big hop character easily drinkable and pleasant to sip. It does remind you of a barleywine.    Overall a very tasty Imperial IPA,. It is best shortly before it reaches room temp, as the warmer it gets, the more it enters hoppy barleywine territory. I paid $35/4-pk, and I'll likely let the remaining 3 age for years and compare against fresh bottles at those times. I think as it ages, the alcohol heat will dissipate and bring out some very complex flavors.

Tall white head with heavy lacing.    Smell - Sweet spiky citrus hops on top of a light salty cracker-like scent. Not as strong as I expected honestly. Quite pleasant actually.    Taste - A fairly balanced and tasty beer falls away into alcohol. The flavor matches the smell, light cracker malt with some sweet hops on top. It's just that the alcohol comes through and washes it all away.    Feel - Medium body and medium carbonation all checks out, but the sinus-clearing alcohol really roughs it up.    Overall - A great IPA with too much alcohol for its own good. I'll have to try DFH's lighter offerings sometime.

On the other hand, it tastes more like a barley wine or even a strong old ale than an imperial IPA. Nice orange-copper, slightly hazy color with some mild head and very spotty lingering lacing. Smells of some dark fruit, fruity and piney hops. Tastes of some bitter citrus zest - grapefruit, orange, lemon - as well as some mild piney hops, vanilla, raisin, fig and some malt. The dark fruit hits me a little more than the brighter hoppiness. Quite dry and bitter but still tasted good. Smooth mild mouthfeel with a little bite, and a fair amount of warming alcohol. Definitely a slow sipper.

Aroma with notes of caramels, pine, booze, orange peel, resin and candy.  Flavor with notes of pine, caramel, grapefruit, melon, booze, sugar cane, oak and toasted malts. Very dry and bitter aftertaste.  Full velvety body with mild carbonation. Alcohol of 15-20% abv give a warming and numbing effect. It is somewhat sticky.  This is quite powerful hop juice. Good fix for hopheads. I felt this more of an American Barley Wine rather than a DIPA, though. This is better for sipping on a colder night. So, a bit more in the liquor territory than beer. I want to have another aged version to see how complexity evolves and hops mellow out.

Pours a very cloudy orange color with a finger width foamy head. Head retention is minimal to non-existant. Lacing is good. Has a aroma of candied malts, maybe some dark fruits. You can definitely get the alcohol content. Very sweet taste. Candied malts, brown sugar, with some bitterness. The high ABV is still very detectable on the taste, but it doesn't strike me as something as high as 18% would be, but then again, I am not sure if I have had a beer this strong before. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

I don't really think of it as an IPA, although I won't argue that term, I just think of it as more of a barley wine, or at least a beer to sit down and relax with at the end of the day. Truth be told though, the last time I had one was at a pool party - BBQ and I still enjoyed that so... I don't know, you get the idea I think. It's quite hazy, even cloudy in the glass with a deep amber/orange body beneath a finger-thick head of creamy yellowed off-white. The head holds fairly well but it has dropped now and only a thin surface covering remains surrounded by a thicker collar and 'distant mountains' of lace rising along the rim. In the nose it's quite floral and malty. Some alcohol is in there as well, which isn't usually good, but it doesn't come off in a bad way. For a beer of 15-20% abv that's to be expected though; and I just happened to notice that that's no longer listed on the label. On to the flavor... there's a nice fruitiness to it, I assume both from yeast and the hops. I'm getting citrus including grapefruit and orange, and maybe a squirt of lemon, apple, pear, and dried orange. Maybe some other dried fruits as well. It remains floral and I wonder how much of that is from hops and how much is from alcohol. You can definitely taste the alcohol but it doesn't quite go over the edge and crash and burn at the bottom of a ravine. I've had better vintages that have had less alcohol, and more hops, but it's still OK. The malt has just a bit of caramel to it, which is nice, too much caramel would've weighted it down. It's sweetish and fruity, but there's also some solid bitterness to it, and the alcohol helps to cut through the malt and dry it out in the end so that it doesn't become too sweet or cloying. In the mouth it's full bodied and viscous, dextrinous but also cut by the alcohol, and modestly sharp due to that, coupled with a slightly less than median carbonation that allows it to have a slight edge and then become very soft and velvety smooth. It really is like a barley wine, an American barley wine, and I'm perfectly content to just slowly sip at it. It's not the best iteration that I've tried, and, in fact, it might be the worst, but I'm familiar enough that I can group the memories of those previous examples together with what's in front of me and come up with a composite score.

But this guy doesn't even know to spell "too". I agree it is "Way to high ABV" and it is AWESOME! Excellent use of the word "high" BTW. Beer is a gift from G-d and I am thankful that this is an example of the Lord on High.    This is the highest ABV beer I have ever had that still just tastes like an excellent craft beer. Kudos to Dogfish Head Brewery for the genius move in crafting this beer!!    To my friend above I spit three times “pooh, pooh, pooh” . Yes I'm Jewish and I know this beer would get Bubbe's seal of approval.

Smells of candied malts like a barley wine. Light fruity qualities like melon and pears. Some alcohol and stinky foot.    A huge balance of sweet, malty, barley wine like alcohol, and fruity, citrusy, slightly piney hops.     Syrupy body with low to moderate carbonation. Certainly hides the ABV, so that I'd put it down to 10-12% if I didn't know better.    More hoppy than I'd expected, this was bottled on July 3rd 2018, drinking in Redding, CA, August 9th, 2018. Just over a month old. Worth a try as a beer to seek out.

S: Sweet and boozy. Resinous pine and citrus hops.    T/F: Thick and sweet... toasty grains and alcohol (not surprising giving the hefty ABV). Bitter hop profile... so much so that it almost balances the ethanol. Fresh and citrusy... pine, resin, and dankness. Oily on the mouth... coating the tongue and warming on the way down. The finish is more sweet malt and citrus.    O: An outstanding and over-the-top kinda beer. Great flavor... complex and great for aging (I've had different vintages and they definitely change over time... becoming fuller/mellower with less bitterness... more like a big barleywine as they get older). A beer that only Dogfish Head could truly do justice to.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This is a 2017 keg aged by the bar owner of McK's Tavern in Daytona Beach. I have had the beer fresh but this review is for an aged keg.    The look is a nice cloudy copper color with 1/2" khaki head that dissapears quickly leaving nice lacing. The smell has slight hop, caramel and some alcohol. Taste starts with caramel malt and cane sugar followed by a little alcohol with some citrus and pine kicking in at the finish. The feel is nice with slight, fine, prickly carbonation, full bodied side of medium and an enjoyable warming from the ABV.    Overall a year in the walk in cooler changed this as would be expected. The hops have faded but the caramel and some sweetness has evolved. The mouth feel has gained some viscosity and the alcohol heat has faded. Still a sipper and pretty darn good.

On the one hand I’m surprised and impressed by the enjoyable bright citruseyness that breaks through the thick 18.5% ABV cloud of this brew. On the other hand, the alcohol burn is very potent and absolutely demolishes any flavors here aside from those related to citrus. This is a fun after dinner drink to share with friends but not something I’d generally seek out over a more balanced option.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Poured from 11.2-ounce bottle into a proper tulip glass. Bourbon colored body, with a finger or so of eggshell colored foam that settles without a trace. Aromas of spruce and pine resin, with undertones of caramel and orange peel. These are prominent on the palate as well, with a ton of alcohol burn. Well balanced. Drinks like a cordial, although there is not much sweetness to speak of. Not much bitterness, either, considering the vast number of hops that gave their lives to produce this. Overall, an interesting brew that's worth a try if you're not put off by the expense.

This IPA is an experience like no other. It’s golden, beautiful, surprisingly complex and sweet. It’s going to knock you on your ass. For me, I only get cranky when my 120 is empty. I feel it’s really a Trippy beer experience...a party in your mouth. That said, you need a plan. One will make you very happy. Two on same day, you are not driving and probably a bit bent. Take on a 4 pack like I have more than a couple times and you are missing work the next day. I don’t care how bad you are...you are done. For the best experience, plan on one and what you will follow it with before your first sip. It’s such a great beer that it is so easy to build a happy 120 rave. That said, most don’t have that luxury or blind fortitude. Enjoy the ride. I love this beer. Ps 60 min is mainstay groupie, 90 minute is my favorite.

Surprisingly subtle on the nose, hints of flowers but almost like smelling a gin.     You won’t be ready for the first taste. Nothing like an IPA at all- it drinks more like a spirit than a beer (the batch I had was marked at 16.8% ABV., so that’s not terribly surprising).     It’s rich and complex. It reminds me of if you took a field of wildflowers and distilled it down into a beer- Grassy, earthy, and floral.     Delicious.

My sense of smell is not the best but this wakes it right up with fabulous scents of sweet, bready malts and fruity, piney, spicy hops. Taste is truly superlative. Rich and complex, it holds its extreme alcohol beautifully with ferocious tones of lupulin, big big big malts and a strong peppery character. An IPA for the ages. I always keep several of these in my cellar and they do age beautifully. A five-year-old against a fresh was a sublime experience and next year I’ll have one that’s ten!

Pleasant building numbing sensation as I sip.  FEEL: Full body, plenty of fizz, sticky and dry on finish.  OVERALL: This really grew on me as I sipped it.

Only issue for me is the much higher price at $37 for a 4 pack. It's great and I guess it's worth it, but I would not want to pay that amount to drink this regularly and it's too rich to be a regular drinker anyway, but it is perfect for an occasional indulgence.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 12oz bottle, purchased May 2018, poured into a tulip glass. Second bottle in the cellar to try in a few years.     Pour: deep burnt orange color. Small 1/2 finger head, dissipates quickly to a small ring. No lacing. Interesting because of the unique color.    Nose: alcohol is upfront. Citrus, orange, pine all present but dominated by the alcohol. Still pretty pleasant.     Taste: boozy, piney hops. A little citrus but, like the nose, the booze dominates. But, it’s pretty good booze. Plenty of hop bitterness as well. Surprisingly drinkable.     Mouthfeel: syrupy, rich, viscous, oily. Carbonation seems minimal but maybe masked by the booze. Its a mouthfull. I like it.     Overall: this is exceptionally strong, as expected. But surprisingly drinkable. The alcohol overwhelms the hops but, still unique and enjoyable. They say it ages well and I’m guessing that’s right. Looking forward to trying in a year or two.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Rule #1: Age this beer!!!!    I bought 2 bottles of this in May 2016. I drank the first one in September 2016 and it was very close to being a drain pour. It was super hot and felt like I was taking a shot with every sip. I stored away the second bottle not sure if I'd ever want to try it.    Fast forward to May 2018. The second bottle was now 2 years old. I chilled it and cracked it open this passed weekend. This was a whole different experience. The beer mellowed into something wonderful that I truly enjoyed.   
look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 3.75 Poured from a bottle two months from bottling into a nonic pint glass. Cloudy upon pouring that cleared a bit after a few minutes with no sediment. Amber in color with a thin white head and light/medium lacing.   Smells a bit sour and boozy up front and then malty with what I think of as plum and apricot notes.   First few sips taste sour up front but not after that. Faint piney finish and sweet. Buttery taste as well. Not too complex in flavor on my palate,just mostly boozy and buttery. The best part of this brew,for me,is the buttery feel that it also leaves on the tongue for a few seconds after swallowing.  I would recommend spending your money on something else but maybe it needs to age for a while as the bottle says to enjoy now or in a decade.

Tastes like hoppy, malt and full but not hot from the high alcohol. Mouthfeel is full without being cloying and the balance is just right. Dogfish Head claims it ages well. I'm currently sipping a 20 month old bottle and I disagree. I have a lot of sediment in mine, yeast maybe, just floating in the beer looking really unattractive. The hop aroma and flavor have fallen off severely. Still hop forward its basically an over hopped barely wine at this point. Drink this beer fresh.

Definitely didn't have the patient to age the beer for more than 2 hours, let alone the suggested year. This beer had a lot of the similar qualities that I love from the 90 minute IPA with deep orangish amber hue, and a malty raison smell with an obviously complex hop schedule. The taste definitely has a rum raison touch to the strong malt and hop character. This is a VERY drinkable beer given the ridiculously high ABV. There is an obvious alcohol taste that can bite, but given how strong this is it carries a nice body!

Appearance- copper with an orange-ish head. very slight transparency. not much head even on a hardy pour and dissipates somewhat quickly.     Aroma- boozy with some light citrus. oranges mostly. tiny bit of burnt caramel.     Taste- boozy for sure. like the aroma. really sweet. sugary. drinkable but alil rough.     Mouthfeel- medium carbonation. alil slick. decent carbonation.     Drinkability- one and done. glad i didn't buy a four pack.     Overall- for being such a strong sassy beer it's best attribute is it's mouthfeel/ body. it's like you're drinking a decent ipa with a shot of rum in it. i've had this before and thought it was overrated but i decided to give it another try. anyone buying a four pack of this for 45 bucks are insane. i don't get it... so you drink it sooner to get the hop notes and get the strong booze or you age it to smooth it out and let the hop notes die off. i think when i first had it i aged it two years and it stil kinda sucked. don't get me wrong this isn't a bad beer but just overpriced and overhyped.

They say you shouldn't criticize a dancing bear for the quality of his moves, and maybe it's wrong to criticize this beer, which can't help being too big and too awkward to make the moves asked of it.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 I had this very fresh, just over 2 months since bottling. It pours dark amber with virtually no head, which is not surprising given the high ABV. The aroma is very boozy indeed which overshadows any hops (and there are truckloads of them in this beer) or even malts. The taste is similarly boozy, and you can feel the alcohol travel down to you belly. Some mild citrus aromas and flavors come through alongside some pine as an aftertaste. Full body and with minimal carbonation.

Smell is boozy slight dark fruit     Taste is as expected boozy and slightly sweet very much like a heavy barley wine but smooths into a piny fruity aftertaste.    Feel is thick and filling..    Overall very interesting drinks like a barley wine but as an ipa a little thick for me.. awesome beer though

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 I had avoided the Dogfish Head IPAs since I don’t like overwhelming hops in most IPAs, but after really liking the 90 minute I went for it. It poured with a lot more carbonation than I expected nearly overflowing a 16 oz glass. The flavor was a good balance of hops and malt. It is definitely hot but what can you expect with this much alcohol. Overall I think I like the 90 minute better, but to make something this strong taste this good is impressive.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 L: Amber in color somewhere in the SRM 22-24 range, based on the lighting. With about 1.5 finger of pillowy creamy white head that dissipates, at a moderate rate and leaves no lacing.    S: A little boozy on the smell, but this is really a hop bomb for the most part.    T: Mild booziness that lasts throughout. Moderately sweet up front due to all the malt used to get this to 18%. The sweetness is subdued fairly quickly by the hop flavor, and the hops dominate from there on.    F: It's surprisingly smooth until you get to the end, when the hops really ramp up and provide a nice little bite.    O: I don't care what this is being marketed as, but this is a American-style Barleywine and that's what I'm rating it as. Of course they probably wouldn't sell near as much of it if they referred to it as a Barleywine.

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 This beer pours pours a fairly muddy amber with a smallish head.

The flavor is an overwhelming, but in a good way - the first thing I notice are the sweet, rich malts - butterscotch, caramel, even vanilla, then huge hop derived cedar, pine, resin, cannabis, caramelized onion, dill, thyme, and rosemary. the mouthfeel is heavy and thick with soft, bubbly carbonation. Overall this is an astounding beer - so complex and profound, just a true sensation.

Overall it came out modest in may respects. It was very good but maybe it had a little bit too much alcohol for my liking.    Look: Semi-clear copper hue with an inch off-white head.    Aroma: sweet dark fruits and some alcohol    Taste: It's sweet, there's dark fruit and some citrus, and moderate piney hoppiness. It is a bit boozy, but not at all as much as one would expect for 16.50%, far from it. Still this is a bit too much for me.    Feel: thick and full

Not my thing really.Feels viscous and slick. Overall this is too extreme. I am not surprised that an almost 40 proof beer is a bit gnarly.Glad I bought only 2. This is not really an IPA in my opinion. Give me a tropical hop bomb at 8% any day over this.I think people enjoy this because it will get you wrecked. I only had two beers, honest. I love beer and don't get this. Like a beer flavored Liqueur. Lastly, why does DFH overload their malt so heavy. Cloying sweet syrup. I was expecting the mother of hop bombs and tasted thick nastiness. Revised: 3/19/18. Aging this beast made all of the difference. Laying it down for 6 months made it potable. Really quite good. DFH should age this first. Tastes so much more refined!!

Smell is a little citrus, leather, orange liquor. Taste is thick, notable alcohol presence, orange liquor, white grapes, dark fruit, whiskey. Thick, creamy, full body meant for sipping, yet somehow does a good job of hiding the 18% ABV. Very interesting beer, tasty, great sipper. I'd buy again without a doubt.

A mainly clear amber orange with a half finger head that moves quickly to a thin lace. The smell is heat, leather, hops and slight dark fruit. The taste is interesting. Not sure how to describe it. Getting some orange citrus mixed with plum, with not as much heat as I was expecting, though it is present. The 90 minute with some more punch. The mouthfeel is dense, the carbonation vacillates between low and medium. Overall was glad to finally come across this and try it, looking forward to see how it ages.

It has classic IPA flavors but with the alcohol overwhelming everything. Really difficult to drink.

It is a thick beer that coats as it goes down. I think that it had a bit of a delayed release in my stomach as I certainly felt it in my stomach well after I had drank it. Next to the 60 minute IPA, which is my favorite IPA, the 120 minute IPA is right there next to it.

So I'll start this review off by saying I'm reviewing this more as a barleywine than a IPA. Onward!    Pours a dark amber color with less than a finger head that lingers on the ring of the glass. No lacing.     Smell is huge plum, toffee, brown sugar, glazed apple, pumpkin spice, and a vanilla chai. Smells like fall.    Taste is everything I want. A whisky soaked plum and apple, cinnamon, molasses, brown sugar, bitter dark fruit.    Feel is unreal. Thick and chewy likea bowl of bourbon plum oatmeal. Very little carbonation, drinks more like a bourbon or some other liquor.    Overall this is almost a perfect beer for me. I love barrel aged brews and damn it if this doesn't seem like a BA barleywine. But it's an IPA. I dunno. I'm buzzin. This sucker don't mess around! The real deal right here and a must have for any beer enthusiast.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I started drinking craft beer 4 1/2 years ago and in my part of the country this is the first time it has been available in this area since that time. The girl who owns the craft beer bar/store/resturant said she has not seen it in this area in 5 years.  I am in the Charleston South Carolina area so craft beer is a big market. We are home to the world renowned Charleston Beer exchange. We have a multitude of craft beer only bars, craft beer stores and basically craft beer everywhere. So there is a lot of built in hype. I passed in having it on tap since they would limit me to one 10 ounce pour and opted for the bottle. There was no date on the bottle, but it looked new just based on the label (crisp fresh looking paper) but I have no idea when it was brewed. Anyway I am a huge IPA fan and favorably view Dogfish head products. The beer poured nicely with a very solid (can not see thru amber color). This just looked like it was full body. A nice small head and quality lacing on the glass during consumption.  It is a vert different tasting IPA. Not hoppy, just very different and complex flavors, but it still tasted like an IPA to me more than anything else others have claimed. Definitely a most different IPA from anything else I tasted before. Can feel and taste the alcohol almost to a fault.   Maybe the hype and not having this beer built my expectations up too much. I was a little disappointed in the taste, but not much and my disappointment may stem from lack of availibity (you always want what you can't get) . I imagined the beer of beers. Truth be told though it is a damn good tasting beer and you feel it trust me. Not up there with some of my all time favorites, but a beer I would drink again. I recommend people try it, you should enjoy it and yes you will feel the effects of the ABV. However, the price and lack of availability would not bring me charging back to it. Hey I don't due the fancy reviews, I taste something and I like it or not. Glad to have tried it. Not bad at all.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; no production data, but appears to be the latest vintage.  A: Pours a very hazy, amber-orange with clearing evident throughout. Leaves a half inch foamy head with modest retention, but strong lacing.  S: Aromas of caramel, lemon, peach, cocoa, and pine. Complex and enjoyable.  T: Sweet. Blood orange taste really struck me initially, but complex with flavors of caramel, sherry, and mead very evident. Strong, but exceptionally well balanced bitterness.  M: Full bodied with excellent carbonation. Boozy, but I mean that in a good way.  O: Color me impressed. Drinking this early clearly had its advantages based on the other comments (I refrained from reading them until I was done tasting). My pour was characterized by strong carbonation, head formation, and lacing, which evidently is not the case after aging. Not that aging will not add to the complexity. That said, even in its youth, this was a complex and really enjoyable example of the American DIPA style. Yes, it is at the level of a barley wine, so consider sharing it with a friend. Let me suggest, he or she will be a good one afterwards if they have any appreciation for beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 This is a 2014 vintage, so I'm thinking this one is in barleywine territory by now. But this was a gift from my bro @jzeilinger so I'm gonna give this one a shot.    Appearance: Dark and murky brown with no head to speak of.    Aroma: Toffee and burnt sugar. Mainly a dank smelling beer. I am NOT a fan of the aroma at all. It just smells...old. Hopefully the taste makes up for it.    Taste/Mouthfeel: First impression its like chewing on a handful of raisins and then a brown sugar and maple sweetness comes up and is all evened out with a huge hit of bitter hops. A boozy beer for sure, but the sweetness and bitterness don't let the alcohol come through at all.    Overall: I definitely think this is a barleywine and not an IPA, but of course with 3 years in this it's going to be well beyond an semblance on an IPA. A well crafted beer, however not one I would want to drink again alone, 6 oz. would be more than enough.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Age unknown bottles we're brought out of storage at a local shop and the labels had begun deteriorating.  As others have said this is definitely more a barley wine than a beer. The taste was almost sickeningly sweet of floral, honey or maybe agave and as others have said possibly raisin?  The smell was comparable to fresh clover honey and the mouth feel even possessed a sweet stickiness.   Very expensive but well worth buying.

And I'm sorry, but it's not that much of a kick in the head. It's an average pinot with cherry and barley.     There's hype. I get the hype. But it's wine beer. Wine beer disappoints both categories. Thus beer is interesting, which is not a synonym for great. But that's the measure it's trying to live up to.

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 This a beer that needs to be properly aged at least 2 years, and in my experience begins to peak sometime before year 7. (It still tastes great fresh.) I've had it 10 years old at the brewpub a couple of times and it's pretty tasty at 10, too. (Dogfish seems to wind down their stash of each beer at 10 years.)  Oh, one other thing. If you go into this beer expecting an IPA you're going to be sorely disappointed. Aged 120 Minute is un-beerlike let alone un-IPAlike, but even fresh it doesn’t have the bitterness that’s typical of IPAs. Try it at least once, since it’s iconic.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 IMHO, this isn't an IIPA, it's a barleywine...a very good barleywine!! Full of boozey, hoppy, sweet goodness. Only had one, as I came across it while on vacation to Cali and didn't have the time for a four-pack (I know...weak excuse). I hope to get another chance to review this, but thanks to NC's ridiculous law restricting .abv, I don't know when that may be.

M - Heavy and slick in body, the feel is oily and rich with barley wine qualities to it.  O - Glad this had a few years on it, still on a good trajectory, rich experience to say the least.

So much more barleywine than "IPA". Nose is boozy, raisins, maybe a touch of maple. Tastes more like a quad: molasses and raisins with a decently rounded mouthfeel. That gives way to a light alcohol burnt and thinness that make me wonders how long this should be aged? It's boldness adds to the mouthfeel, but at the same time, it all feels like a bit too much at this point. It, lingers... 90/4's (at best) feels right for this 3 year old.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Absurd, but intriguing, should be on everyone's bucket list, if even a spit bucket.   a) Mine was bottled 90 days ago, so entirely too young, and barely a head over a cloudy, dark, petrified amber body, fully expect to see fossilized (crystalized) hops and grasshoppers frozen within. No bubbles show, the beer could be solid.   s) Fecund, fertile, ancient, dank. Hoppy, with set, spent floral character, and a candy store worth of malty sweetness. Hop bitter on the tail.  t) Extremely hoppy, with strong bitter, tongue biting finish. Malty sweetness masks the hop parade (avalanche?) Alcohol masks the subtle flavors. This is a bear to age/hibernate at least a year before consuming. Ample sugars again mask the floral hop nuance. A sipper. A flawed monster.   f) Smooth and wet, oily. Let it age for better feel.   o) Headachy? Next to a 6.5% IPA it's no contest in favor of the IPA.

From reading the bottle I had braced myself for a blast of bitter hops but was instead met with a sweet maltiness, there were hops present but not quite enough to be considered the holy grail of hopheads IMO. To be this high of an ABV the alcohol was very well hidden, this could be sneaky. Overall this one was pretty good, I would definitely drink it again if I find it in a normal retail setting.

L -- Pours a vivid, slightly hazed orange with a fairly small, cream-colored head produced with well-aerated pour. Minimal retention and some lacing, as to be expected with the high ABV. Looks really pleasing in a snifter. There is some sediment on the bottom of the bottle so make sure to decant when pouring!  S -- Very boozy upfront, with strong notes of rubbing alcohol, bourbon, and barrel. Some sweet caramel malts and dank resinous hops in the background, but the aromas are really dominated by the booze...  T -- Again, *very* boozy upfront with a hot sharpness that cuts through a lot of the other nuanced flavors going on here. I'm also picking up caramel malts, deeply herbal and piney hops, bourbon, and a hint of orange liqueur.   F -- Big, boisterous mouthfeel that somehow remains crisp like most IPAs, despite the incredibly high ABV. The booziness is a little too sharp, however, and the malty sweetness borders on cloying.   O -- This one might be a little too much for me. The malts that are used to offset the bitterness from the extreme hopping seem to take over a little too much.    74/100

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Look: Pours a seared gold color that forms a dark-amber body in the glass. Minimal off-white head that quickly dissipates to thin lacing on the edges and center. Visible carbonation with tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass too the lacing.     Smell: Very malty, even for a double IPA, light pine and floral notes, alcohol esters in the back of the nose.    Taste: Very sweet and malty up front followed by heavy pine and wood tar notes from the hops. Back note is very spicy with alcohol esters    Feel: Thick but not syrupy on the body, carbonation helps to lighten the brew.    A good beer, but not great. Even as a fan of Imperial/Double IPAs this was a bit much, and certainly not worth the $10 a bottle price tag in my neck of the woods

Mild carbonation but fitting.   O: very good as a barley wine and ok as an IPA. Emjoyes this one and really like the flavor mix. Just not true to an IPA. Big pine and orange toffee.

Pours thick and pretty much transparent dark yellow. Lots of sediment, I'm sure from both the aging process and the amount of hops. Aroma and taste still pretty hot after all this time. Still got hops in the taste. Very big bold flavors of booze, citrus hops, bitter, spices. Nothing complex. A unique beer. Good one to share.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Staring at a chilled, full bottle, gotta admit, I'm mildy apprehensive about this one. Could it be that I'm a few (okay more than a few) beers in? Maybe. Could it be that this is a beast of a beer? More likely. Could it be that I'm afraid that this will be a boring hop bomb with no real depth and nothing new to offer??? Yeah that's kinda what it is, but fuck this. I'm going to review it anyway, because cool cat loves me.     A: pours a lovely, amber reddish orange, hazy with a quickly dissipating sheet of white foam that quickly becomes a ring, has pleasant lacing as well. In short, nice.  S: sharp malt and earthy, resinous hop aroma abounds! Though I didn't really have to lean into this one to take a whiff, I did, because I'm nothing if not thorough. Clean and sticky pine note, what seems to be citrus (orange specifically). It immediately seems like (shocker, I know) a ramped up version of 90 minute. It's extremely peppery, and almost meaty. It does have those barleywine characteristics everyone mentions which totally makes sense. I feel like someone shoved my nose into a tree and I love it! Pungent and woody (maybe some bergamot)!  T: Okay...drumroll...seems good so far...here goes nothin'...where the fuck are the hops??? It's bitter...a little, but my immediate impression is roasty, with a subtly warm alcohol bite. This is toasty, roasty, and, yes, I know, incredibly sweet. Unfortunately I don't see any date code on the bottle, but I find 90 minute to have more bite than this. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those guys obsessed over IBUs, they have their place, but this needs more to fit it's malt body. It is far too sweet. But, onward and upward. There is bergamot (orange), there is toastiness and roastiness, there is sweetness and there is woodiness, some berry notes as well. There is a delayed but warm alcohol finish, that is more like a liquor than even a fortified wine, like liquor specifically, which is fairly pleasant honestly. The more I drink this, the more it reminds me of earl grey tea, the bergamot really comes through. (side note: the alcohol is impressively well masked in this one)  M: Sticky and incredibly full  O: I'm not sure how old the bottle I have is unfortunately. I got it in NYC in the last two months. That being said, 120 IBUs my ass, either A) No, it's not, or B) it's not enough for the malt, but the only beer that I have had that was memorably sweeter than this was Cuvee Van De Keizer Blauw and it was borderline undrinkable. There's a good beer in here, the malt body is wonderfully built and the hops chosen seem to add a good character to the beer, but for me...first of all based on expectation, and second of all based on pure taste, this beer needed more bitterness to make it work. The sweetness here borders on cloying, and it's frustrating, because other than that, it's good, but if that were resolved, it would be great. In summation...ehh...I dunno. Reminds me of Samichlaus in that it is... ... ... ..disappointing. 3.9 as an avg is fucking generous. I love you Icarus, I mean, Dogfish head.    (PS: this beer is so strong, I decided to head it off at the pass about mid way through with a bag of fritos, which unfortunately adds a touch of rubbing alcohol to the flavor)   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 At about $10/12 oz bottle, and being about 3x higher alcohol than a regular beer, this is one that I consider a special occasion beer. The taste is fantastically intense, full of piney and resinous flavors. The overall experience is more akin to drinking a strongly peaty scotch like Ardbeg in that each sip is complex and something to savor. A single bottle easily lasts me an hour, although the better move is to enjoy a 6 oz pour in a snifter and then finish the rest later in the evening.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12oz bottle dated 4/7/17-- so only about 3 months on it.    Pours a medium amber color with a 1 finger head with great retention. Extremely cloudy, can't see through the glass.    Aroma is very interesting. There is some booze, lots of hops, caramel, and malts. Has a slight bourbon like character in my opinion. It smells very potent in an unusual way. Not straight hops, not straight booze, somewhere in the middle...    Taste is hops and loads more malts than expected. Very sugary and caramel-like. Definitely notice the booze but the other flavors are not hidden by it. Not overly hoppy. Slightly bitter but sweetness comes through more strongly.    Feel is heavy and syrupy. Creamy and thick, slightly cloying. Definite alcohol warming.    Overall an extremely unique beer. I have never had anything like it. I agree with other reviewers that it contains some American Barley wine qualities but I definitely wouldn't classify it as one. No this beer is a beast of its own. Definitely worth trying.

He grabbed a four pack of this and said it was the most rancid thing to cross his lips. The other three bottles are mine.    Look - Almost a brownish golden hue with a minimal head. Carbonation is low. No lace or stick.    Smell - Wet catty hops and alcohol. Like there was virtually no attempt to hide the alcohol here. At all.    Taste - Only 18% you say? Tastes like rubbing alcohol with some cat piss mixed into the bunch from the hops used.    Feel - Thick and burning. Swallows rough and astringent.    Overall - Usually DFH makes some great beers. I always wanted to try this but the day my local craft shop received it a man came in and offered $350 for a single case in order to bypass the one bottle limit. What a fucking idiot. Glad this was given to me. Not quite sure what gimmick DFH is trying to pull but I've had TRIPAS near this ABV that were a thousand times better. Guess I can pawn off the remaining bottles to my neighbor. Terrible.

Half finger off white head that dissipates rapidly. Legs. Hazy to opaque. Very little lacing.    First smell is whiskey. Had the wife to check my breath and she says pure whiskey. Maybe some caramel malts. Some citrus hops.     Taste mimics the nose. Whiskey burn fades into plain alcohol heat. This brew has way to much alcohol. Some citrus hops make it through the alcohol burn.    Full sticky mouthfeel with good carbonation.     Overall I couldn't get past the boozy smell and alcohol flavor. They bury the nose and the palate. I sense a good beer underneath. Just to much of a good thing. The 90 Minute IPA wins hands down.

I picked up one bottle when I saw it for the first time earlier this year, I liked it so much I picked up a couple more bottles - if not for how expensive it is, I would have eagerly bought a few cases!    I was surprised at how easy it was to drink this delicious beer, no burn*, just a little warming from the high % ABV! I was also pleasantly surprised that it did not taste overly bitter to me as the "120 IBUs" suggested. I found it very balanced for the style ("Imperial IPA" or "Triple IPA"). (* - When I say no burn, perhaps I mean no more than I would have wanted, and less than I expected, considering the strength of this beer!)    It reminds me a bit of Bell's Hopslam, it had a lovely aroma and slightly heavy (but very appropriately so) mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. I wish it hadn't been so long since I'd had it (a few months ago) because I can no longer accurately describe the aroma or taste but I do remember the ONLY thing I disliked about this beer was the price. I will review again next release so I can write some better descriptions.    I put 4.75 for the "look" because there was nothing about the appearance that distracted me from the other excellent qualities of the beer - I don't think the appearance could be improved for this type of beer nor do I think it's important, it simply looks like it should?

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from fridge temp to tulip. Bottled in March of this year, so it's fresh. Pours a golden orange with minimal head. Quickly dissipates. Nose is citrus and hops. Not getting much alcohol heat on the hose. Taste is quite a punch in the face. I love the hops and alcohol heat, which is definitely present on the taste. To me, this is a classic strong American barleywine. Kind of an Old Guardian on steroids. There is a sweet syrupy taste which evolves into a dark fruit (cherry) flavor. Definitely some burn on the way down. Mouthfeel is nice, although not as thick as I would have expected. Overall, a really nice beer.

Appearance: Cloudy amber gold with a short but dense, frothy head of off white foam and sparse lacing.    Smell: Pine needles, citrus zest, candied orange rind and clean alcohol - almost gin in the aroma.    Taste: Big, malty body to balance the intense hops. Honey, pine resin and deep, herbal bitterness. Warm, almost numbing alcohol kicks in after a few sips.    Mouthfeel: Full, sticky, coating feel with moderate carbonation.    Overall: Intense and boozy, but still incredibly well balanced. Shows off the piney aspect of its hops amidst a potent brew for sipping.

Good for 2 people to split a bottle if you plan on drinking other stuff that day. It wasn't my bottle. If it was, I would have aged it at least 6 months to take the boozy edge off. Overall, for the asking price, it's a beer I would buy 1 or 2 bottles of, but not go crazy trying to stock.

Bottled 04/07/17, stored at 42 degrees, served at 42 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.  Aroma – An almost oily smell of citrus peel and a little spruce.  Head – large (Maximum 4.5 cm, aggressive pour), off white with a yellowish cast, medium density froth, above average retention time, diminishing to an uneven five to seven mm ring of tiny to average bubbles and a complete layer of varying thicknesses.  Lacing – fair. Small pieces and drag marks of tiny bubbles.  Body – amber, hazy.  Flavor – moderately bitter and malty. Hops flavor is subdued and lacking distinct tendencies toward the usual descriptors of piney, floral, fruity, etc. The alcohol does not show in either the taste or aroma but makes its presence known in the slow gastric burn.  Palate – medium, oily, soft carbonation.    Well. IMHO overpriced and over rated. The bottle states that it ages well. Maybe I’ll stick a couple away for a year or two then revisit.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 I had this in a chalice. The appearance was a hazy orange to brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. There was barely any lacing but what was there trickled and slid right into the beer. The smell started off with booze making me think I should’ve waited on this Because of the amount of booze I got from this, it took me a good three hours to consume this. As it warms, there are some nice sweet citrus fruity malts along with a super light bitterness from the hops. The taste had a long dry sweet fruity and somewhat bitter flavoring running all about my taste buds. On the palate, it kinda wrecked my taste buds with the amount of booze knocking me back into my recliner. With one month of age on this, don’t try to reckon with this one, as it’s a sipper. Overall, though the booze was strong I’m probably still willing to have again but will most likely next time age it if I ever get that chance again.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Deep rich thick copper color. Extremely appealing to the eyes. The smell is of light pine that is overwhelmed with a boozy aroma. The taste is deep and the best I can explain it is warm and caramaly. There is a lot going on. Every sip tastes somewhat different. It's thick, oily, rich, and beyond words. Not much hop taste but thick malt with a warm downing. Lots of sticky raisin leftovers. For a beer of this gravity it does go down effortlessly. Not much aftertaste which is surprising.     = When I heard my local store had these in I had to try it. My highest ABV beer I've had so far. It pleasantly surprised me. Try this if you ever get a chance and consider yourself a hophead. It's something that's almost indescribable.

First taste is hot with juicy fruit or fruit stripe bubble gum flavor. Subdued tanginess, light bitterness. A touch malt, caramel flavor.    Lower carbonation and medium bodied. Boozy for sure and bitterness is lasting along with the alcohol burn in back of the throat.    I kind of consider this a novelty beer. I don't think its very flavorful, just more boozy than anything. I won't be getting this one again. Yuck!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter, bottled in 2017    A: Pours a amber, copper color with a white head that did not last, very little carbonation, slight lacing, slightly hazy.    A: Big hit of pine and resin that quickly fades into huge sweet, caramel, toffee, and vanilla malts, it's very aromatic but the hop notes are short, also picking up a good amount of alcohol, it seems like the aroma is breathing out of the glass.    T: Some pine and resin that quickly transitions into huge malt notes like caramel, toffee, vanilla, also picking up some rum like notes, it tastes like a lightly barrel aged barley wine. There's a moderate amount of bitterness, finish is semi-dry with lingering notes of malt, caramel, burnt brown sugar, toffee, vanilla. As the beer warms the alcohol gains some presence but it's not noticeable for such a high ABV.     M: Big, chewy, sticky mouthfeel, semi-dry on the palate, leaves that sticky caramel feeling on the roof of my mouth, low carbonation, drinks fairly smooth for such a big beer.     O: Not sure if I would call this a IIPA as the hop presence is lacking but it's there. The malt presence is huge but it adds a lot of depth and complexity, amazingly drinkable for such a high ABV. As the beer warms the slight hop presence fades and the malts gain more presence. Definitely a sipper. If you like IIPAs and barley wines then you must try this. Definitely worth the money at $10.99 a bottle.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Deep gold in color with just slightly off white decent head. Good lacing all the way.  Aroma and taste hit you like a rum soaked fruit cake.  Crazy this is a double IPA. More like a Strong ale or barleywine. Not picking up the hoppiness you would expect.    Hits you with heavy 'booziness'. This would be better on a cold winter night in front of the fireplace.  Nice viscous mouthfel with light to medium carbonation which fits.    Overall, not an everyday drinker, nor can you buy it everyday anyway. Big and tasty but a bit heavy.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 This is a big beer. I was able to purchase four of these because I saw them sitting on the counter at one of my local liquor stores. I asked if they were for sale and yes they were for a cost of $10.99/each so I bought them all! The beer poured a one finger head but dissipated pretty quickly. There is no ABV listed on the bottle but the fact that the head disappeared immediately I am assuming it is quite high. On the nose I pick up some molasses and sweetness of malt. The hops and the ether taste is what catches my palate. This is a big beer and it is not for everyone. If this beer is indeed 18% ABV it is well hidden and drinkable. Could I drink it all day long? Hell no, but I could drink it daily. I am fortunate to have found it! I will age a few bottles and see how it is at a later date. This is a wheelhouse beer and if you can't handle a big, hoppy, high ABV beer you better leave this one for the folks that drink "big boy beer"!

Look: Pours a slightly hazy rust-colored orange, really nice hue. No foam, slight lacing.  Smell: Toffee, fruit, hops, all balanced into an amazing smell. Definitely a lingering caramel aroma, with evident boozy smells as well.  Taste: incredible sticky toffee comes back, balanced by notes of raisin and dark fruit. Clear bitterness that lingers in the back of your mouth. Warm heat, with a structure more like a barrel-aged saison. Either way, amazing beer.  Feel: pretty heavy body, with low but even carbonation and a lingering stickiness. Really smooth for such a heavy hitter.     Amazing beer! So much more than I expected, with a a lot more to this beer than just overwhelming hoppiness. In fact, I found it taking a back seat to all the other flavors found in this beer. Amazing find from Dogfish Head! Highly recommended. Take your time with it!!

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 This is definitely big. I wouldn't really call it an IPA, also its not overtly hoppy either. Bitterness is present but feels on the lower end of things, drinks sort of like a nice Brittish pale or ESB in regard to hops. In regard to malt, feels a lot like a German Bock, lots of dark fruit flavor and aroma, slightly caramel and toffee like.     Booze is up front and bold in this one. Actually in general pretty smooth and the ethanol heat you get meshes with the dark fruit, but there's no denying its present.     Overall this is pretty good. But its like running a marathon, you gotta get yourself psyched up for this one, easy drinking is certainly not a word that comes to mind here.

Pours amber with a frothy cream head. Not much sticky lacing, but the lacing that falls is consistent with a beer crafted with excellence. Aroma is not at all typical of an Imperial IPA or IPA in general - it's actually raisiny and with dark crystal malts in the nose. Hop presence is difficult to determine, but if it's there, I would say it smells somewhat minty. Taste is of raisins and alcohol. It's a difficult one on the palate more so than the nose. While this is a bitter beer at 120 IBUs, it's a pleasant bitterness that doesn't leave my tongue curling. Feel is smooth, somewhat creamy and has a warming nature with medium carbonation. Overall, this is a beer of it's own - I guess technically it's considered a double IPA, but from a craft beer consumer's standpoint, this stands on its own.

A work buddy kept telling me how much better it would be and it was. So much mellower and the have alcohol taste was pretty much gone, nothing like the alcohol bomb of a fresh one. I was worried when I first poured it though as it looked terrible, I thought it had turned at first but it tasted great.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Appearance: hazy orangish body with lots of floaties; small head, but long lasting and good lacing (high marks for the lacing)    Smell: malty sweetness with good hop aroma; much maltier than I expected; peculiar aroma in background, pleasant, maybe like a dried tropical fruit, but also a bit solventy.    Taste: very malty, syrupy sweetness with good hop bite, but not quite enough to balance it out, surprisingly. This is extremely sweet and cloying. It would be a great dessert beer. You could probably pour it over ice cream (or pancakes for that matter). But the flavor is good, so I'll give it a good mark.    Mouthfeel: syrupy and creamy. You can watch the beer slide back down the glass as you drink it.    Remarks: I bought this beer to share with a friend to say we had it. But he moved. I think this one IS best shared.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This one is weird, but not in a bad way. As long as one doesn't expect a "normal" IPA.    Because of the super-high ABV, I knew I had to pour it emphatically to get any kind of head. Doing so yields a thin, light amber head that quickly dissipates in a wisp of foam floating at the top. The smell is pleasant - but not overpowering. To me, it doesn't smell as boozy as it is. There is hops, but it's actually more subdued. Very light citrus, almost no piny-ness to speak of.    The taste is where any divisiveness will really surface. Those expecting mouth-puckering tanginess because of the high hops content will be disappointed. The flavor borders on sweet. For 18%, I get very little alcohol burn in the mouth and throat. It is surprisingly smooth. Carbonation is moderate, and there is a bit of creaminess. This beer *might* possibly go well with certain desserts.    At the potency and price, this is not a beer to drink more than one of at a time, or even on the same day. It should be an occasional indulgence, unless one has bottomless pockets and a very high tolerance for alcohol.    It would be a great prank to pour one of these for an unsuspecting Bud drinker, except that it's such an over the top ale that the person would likely not drink more than an ounce of it. Too expensive to be used in a prank.    In fact, this beer is absurdly expensive. Is it worth the exceptionally high price? Probably not. Is it worth the occasional splurge for a bottle. Probably.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Big malty double ipa type smell but the taste is something else completely..    Some hops flavor but mostly sweetness and a vodka type alcohol flavor come thru .    Maybe aging helps but fresh as is I'm going to say this is a over rated beer that doesn't back up the hype..

Awesome taste. So very different I can't describe it. The hops have a new meaning. Easier drinking than I imagined. I will buy this one again when available. From a 12 ounce bottle at Ron's Corner Tavern. Thanks Jesse!!  5/2018 update. Finally got to try on draft. Seems a bit different, shall I say, FRESH! I know they age well and I think I can tell the difference now. The hop aroma is not as strong and it seems quite a bit boozier fresh on draft and not as smooth. It is still unique this way. Still the Holy Grail for hopheads, it brought me to the peak of hops and have become a true hophead myself. So many IPA’s. So little time.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours a clear amber with a finger of off-white head. Poured 3/4 of the bottle rather aggressively into the glass. Head retention is okay with a ring of white foam lingering for a long while. No lacing left behind. Aroma is hand sanitizer with little hints of citrus hops behind. Flavor profile is boozy, with huge notes of hand sanitizer cleaning and cleansing the tongue before anything else hits. Citrus, and orange hops add to it. Mouth feel is a little fizzy, with a medium thickness. Overall, this brew is loud - LOUD. It's heavy, with huge boozy notes. Not picking up much else behind that. Hops are boisterous to the point of drowning out any singular notes.     Served in a 12oz snifter from a bottle.

Retention is good for a 28 month old beer and there is more lacing than I expected. There is quite a bit of sediment for a beer that's been in a refrigerator at 55 degrees, but I poured aggressively to produce a one inch head. Aroma is sweet caramel and a hint of booze. There is also some pine from what's left of the hops. The taste is sweet smooth malt and dark fruit at first, followed by piney bitterness on the backend. The mouthfeel is rich and full transitioning to bitterness and a moderate alcohol bite. Carbonation is still abundant. Overall, very good. I purchased this 2 years ago and intended to age it and drink as a barley wine. I may have jumped the gun by a year or two. I've had this fresh and it's too much for me (overwhelming bitterness). I think a few more years would really smooth it out, but I could just buy DFH Olde School which is pretty smooth at two years.

It is not hoppy. To call it a TIPA is an offront to hops. This is an alcohol forward, non hoppy, non floral, non citrusy, sickly sweet (but not in a good way) mess. Congrats, bums would enjoy getting drunk on this, but it tastes like I imagine their piss would, alcoholic and awful tasting. I don't understand Dogfish Head at all, they make awful IPAs. It's no wonder you’re named Dogfish, because like your namesake, your s—- beer is nearly inedible. Overrated...   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Look is almost amber with light head and no lacing.    Smell is honey caramel and orange, heavenly.    Taste is complex and changes over the first few sips as your palate adjusts. Honey, caramel, orange and light hops. This beer is more of a sweet alcohol bomb than a hop forward beer. You get the warm belly feeling from the alcohol:-)    Mouthfeel isn't too thick or oily for the amount of sugar and alcohol in it. Pretty much what you'd expect.    Overall a delicious beer. I wouldn't buy it all the time (if it was available constantly) but for once or twice a year, why not. Its a one and done style beer, so don't plan a long session around it. Just enjoy the interesting flavor and the story of how you found it:-) If you like this, try the implication by oddside ales (michigan brewer). Its a 13% ipa.    Edit: just tried it on tap and it's a little different from my memory of it bottled. More fruit than honey notes and more boozy than i remember. Still good, but i think i prefer it bottled.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.75 Great beer if you like hops. At $10 for a 12oz. bottle, it's a wallet buster. But I ended up buying six, won't tell the wife. It is phenomenal. I'm kinda new to super crafts. But this lives up to the hype!!!

F: full-bodied and smooth for an IPA, no afterburn for something like this is nice.   O: this is good and I can see the appeal. However to get one here in central CA I paid $10 for a 12oz.

T: straight up booze, sort've unpleasant, vodka like but would rather drink martini than this.    O: paid $14 for one @ one shop, $10 @ another not worth this price to waste it drinking fresh. I love IPA's, scotch ales, and aged barley wines. This is a beer that needs to be aged. I don't agree with buy one fresh and buy one to age, when it comes to this beer just age it. It doesn't have the fresh IPA bitterness of enjoyment that stone, hope slam, m 43, or many other IPA's possess. This beer is a straight up boozy mess. Fine if you want to get wasted but missing flavor. Now this rating is based on drinking it fresh and in 5 years when I drink the 2nd bottle I may rank this beer higher but for now I am not a fan.

Pours an amber color with a 1/2-finger head. Smells sweet, almost like a wee heavy. Primarily citrus/butterscotch aromas. The palate is also sweet, packed with hops, but the malt/sweetness dulls them a bit. Overall the beer is surprisingly balanced and the alcohol barely noticeable. It has a thick, viscous, slightly sweet mouthfeel but not cloying. Overall a big, pleasant beer though nothing particularly stands out. I look forward to following it as it ages   
look: 3.75 | smell: 1.5 | taste: 1 | feel: 1 | overall: 1.75 I will cut to the chase to avoid confusion. It's cough syrup mixed with rubbing alcohol. Not even glad I got the chance to try it. 
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A - really nice orange amber color with a white that dissipates quickly, as expected at this abv.   S - big sweet booze, caramel, pine, lemon, kind of reminds me of gubna but alot stronger  T - big sweet booze predominates. Pine, grapefruit, orange and lemon peel. Caramel malt presence.  M - heavy because of the alcohol burn. Alcohol very present. Think like if you were used to drinking redbreast and then took a shot of everclear. It's about the same difference going from 60 or 90 minute to this. Afertaste is general hop bitterness and sweet booze.   O - this is the thing --> brew an 18-20% imperial ipa and make it amazing to drink and then ill slam this. Otherwise ive never had anything like this thats even remotely drinkable. It also has legitimate hop character as well. I've got another but ill probably wait a long time before drinking it.

Some fruity stuff like mango & pineapple going on. Only drank half the bottle for fear of getting blasted, as it was not my first beverage of the day. Malt dominant. Stuff is not cheap, but once a year is fantastic. Had drank it a couple times before, and this was the best ever. I thin the fruit comes out over the booze, unless it was lower ABV.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 The bottle I opened was 4 years old and I paid $20.00 at a charity event. My first thought was I just paid $20.00 and my second thought was it is a 4 year old IPA. Now tradition says an IPA needs to be had fresh. So I was not expecting much. Poured into a 12 ounce tulip glass at cellar temp. First impression - it smelled great. Darkish amberish that lets plenty of light through and it is cloudy. Good head that dissipated with no lacing. No idea of ABV but it can be described as a sweet well balanced old IPA with a pleasurable boozy taste that I enjoy. I never would had believed it was 4 years old. I love it. Time for a nap. It's a great beer. Gonna pony up next time it comes around and cellar it for a long time. it is obvious to me that whomever stored it knew what they were doing.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 I have tried this beer twice. The first time was a bottle that was a few days old, the second was a bottle that had been aged for 18 months. This review is for the second beer that was aged.    Look: Hazy orange with small off-white head that persists. Lacing is moderate.  Smell: Toffee with a sweet booze undertone. Slight citrus scent as well. With aging the booze scent mellows out.  Taste: Caramel/vanilla cream flavor followed quickly by a bit of an alcohol bite/burn. However, the alcohol taste is more refined than a fresh 120 and carries a gentle, slightly pleasant burn. Malt flavor comes through after swallowing and lingers on the tongue for a bit, but the booze taste can drown this out if you take too big of a sip.  Feel: Very creamy and full-bodied. Possibly the best mouthfeel of a beer I've ever had. Carbonation is moderate.  Overall: This beer is worth buying, but you should definitely age this beer for at least a year before drinking. An unaged 120 is harsh and the alcohol masks the subtle creamy flavors of this brew.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5 I'd say this is my hands down favorite beer. Some background on this review, only a few years ago I would only drink things like Coors Light, Rolling Rock, lighter beers, I enjoyed stouts as well, was the only unique beer I could drink, they had to be a non-coffee stout though, Guinness for example... I then moved on to a Cider kick and still do enjoy ciders especially anything from McKenzies. Then I saw this beer one night at a bar, had a buzz on and my buddy said he would give me a ride home and as a dumb drunk decision I chose the bars highest ABV beer they had.     And I was absolutely blown away by the taste, it didn't even taste like an IPA, this beer started my craving for all sorts of other IPAs and now I can drink American styled IPAs as long as they aren't super hoppy, this "IPA" as I like to describe it, is amazing, hands down my favorite beer.    It's hard to find but a local beer distributor near me is able to get it frequently now, $180 for a case, or I can wait in line with others in my local town for $150 cases at a different distributor. He will even hold one back for me since we have a mutual friend.     If you come across this beer, and it's not over $12, I HIGHLY recommend it, or if you haven't had them in awhile I would pay anywhere from $15-18 highly depending on location and how long it's been. My local distributor charges $36 for a FOUR pack, $180 for a case.    It's expensive BUT what I do as well, I buy a case, I drink 12 of them whenever I want to have one, and I am letting the others ferment in segments, 1 year, 2 year, 3 years, 4 years, 3 for each segment. I just started this journey of segmenting them but I am super stoked for November 12th 2017 for that 1 year mark for that 3 pack segment :-).

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 It's all about the hops with this delicious brew. This is not, chemical, harsh, in your face hops. This is smooth, sweet, piney, balanced, delicious hops. It may be a little one note for some but that not the point here. The point is to showcase hops like no other beer. I would drink this again and again and again. The high ABV is very tolerable and balanced but I recommend sharing with a friend - it's what god beers are made for anyway.    Update: Just cracked open a 1 year old aged version of this beer and all I can say is WOW. The little bit of aging just smoothed this beer out. It just reached another dimension for me.

Sophisticated, intermingling tropical fruits, earthen tones, and herbs do a phenomenal job of masking the potent ABV. You will know it's their without a doubt, but once you begin to acclimate it's rather inviting. It's not even comparable to the Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA. I don't know when it will be but I look forward to catching it again.

Murky orange to light brown with a short 1/2 cm head which recedes very slowly.  S. Big toffee and booze, more booze, then bitter citrus if get your nose in there, orange, lemon, grapefruit.  T. Oh yeah. Big sweetness, big bitterness, nice balance on the first sip. Second sip has me thinking of cough medicine. Third sip is bitter orange marmalade. My taste buds need to get dialed in to these big flavors and abv. Toffee and citrus seem most prevalent. As it warms there's caramel, spicy and sweet lemon, orange, brandy-soaked caramel apple. Aftertaste is the same with a little mouthwash in there.  F. Full mouthfeel, smooth, sticky. Warming but not really drying in the aftertaste.  O. The high abv didn't "burn," but had a flavor that was slightly off-putting, but a little age may change that. Would I buy a bottle again? Absolutely. Cheers!

look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 4 Very hard to rate this beer. On this snowy winter night, I poured the 120 into a pint glass & let it breathe for 10 minutes. Very cloudy with a medium head which thinned out over the 10 minutes. The first sip was like a blinding shot of bourbon - lots of alcohol heat and malty burnt butterscotch. At this point, I'm thinking I wasted $11 on the bottle (well, ~$90 on the two 4-packs). Halfway through, it had a whole different feel, much smoother and tastier - the burnt taste turned to pleasant piney citrus. And I liked it. Definitely a beer you only of which you have one or two at a time, not one to pound at a party. Gotta have another...but not until next weekend.

Appearance is deep candy colored burnt orange. Thin head if at all. Aromas are almost barleywine like with a subdued hoppy nose. Caramel, molasses, leather . . . I honestly wouldn't think much about the aromas if I thought this was a newly bottled ipa. However, I know this is 4 years old so I'll have to take that into consideration.   Here we go . . . 2 quick small sips reveal a mature American barleywine flavor profile similar to Bigfoot or Old Stock. I actually think this beer is more reminiscent of an old ale than a barleywine which is what I was expecting. The hops are still present though not as dominant as though definitely were 4 years ago. Thin sweet, candy layers are upfront and a tangy alcohol finish on the end. Feel again is reminiscent of and old ale or American take on a barleywine. Sticky, thin, sugary and malty flavors and feel. This beer is hard to pin point on style and feel. I like this a lot . . . It's a big beer and not just because of the abv %. I'll be sipping this for the next hour at least. Overall, excellent beer . . . I personally wouldn't consider this an ipa but perhaps more of an American Barlywine or even an over the top example of an English Old Ale.  In closing . . . . If you like complex beers and perhaps want to over think things (nothing wrong with that) grab a bottle of this.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Pours hazy orange with light fluffy head that disappears to nothing. No lacing. No biggie. Smells are strong alcohol and zesty citrus. Taste follows nose but more pronounced and more complex. Still strong abv heat. Abv actually takes the cake with this one followed by spicey citrus piney after taste. Light malty backing as well. Full bodied and med to high carbonation. Super tasty and totally different. Yet addicting. Of course ill seek this one out again.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Hazy amber pour with short head that doesn't last long.

Light Bitter and a lingering light pine and citrus. As with warms i get a very light vanilla hint    I would buy and let it age to see. You don't have to worry about losing hops flavor because it's quite muted

Price: $8.50  Purchased: Dec. 20, 2016  Consumed: Dec. 20, 2016  Reviewed as: American Double / Imperial IPA   Misc.: Board read 16 pct. ABV, but I still think it was 18 pct. ABV    First time I saw this one and insta-purchased it. Had been wanting to try this despite not really thinking much of the 60 (3.45) and thinking the 90 (4.08) was just good. Probably would have paid up to $10 and locked it down at $8.50 for a 500-ml. pour. Hoping to be in the 4.20 range.    Poured a deep gold hazy color with 3-to-4 fingers of white frothy-to-rocky head when I got it. Was quite dark in there, but appeared to be light bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. World-class uneven foamy lacing. World-class retention. (Sight - 4.50)    Smelled kind of a lot of mush up front, More malty than hoppy, getting caramel, toffee, brown sugar, maple syrup, sappy pine and hints of Citra and Cascade. Smelled more like an American Strong Ale or an American Barleywine than I would have thought. (Smell - 4.00)    Taste follows the nose as more of a strong ale or a barleywine, getting toffee, caramel, earthy leather, maple syrup, brown sugar, sappy pine, dates, raisins and dark fruits. Not picking up any specific hops. Crazy smooth for 18 (or 16) percent. (Taste - 4.25)    Medium body. Sticky texture. Lively carbonation. Earthy finish. (Feel - 4.25)    Wow. This was much better than I thought and much better than the 60 and the 90. Might have even underrated this a tad. (Overall - 4.25)    4.23 | 94 | A-

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Look: Comes out thick and oily for an IPA (although it is an Imperial). 1-finger head, but recedes quickly. Residual bubbling and lacing continues. Deep orange brown color.  Smell: Tons of citrus and tropical fruit. Quite a bit of booze comes through. Malty and caramelly.  Taste: A huge kick in the teeth with the first sip. Bitterness explodes. The bitterness is quickly overtaken by a shot of alcohol. The alcohol burn is bigger than expected. After the alcohol dissolve into your bloodstream, there is a brief taste of caramel, malt, bread, and yeast. Many different hop flavors take turns throughout (citrus, mango, pine, floral). Some fruit flavors linger behind after everything else fades.  Feel: Medium but almost full. Feels pretty thick, oily, and slick. A bit under carbed, but understandable.   Overall: Very powerful Imp IPA. Couldn't sit and drink a 4-pack of these though. More carbonation would be good. A slow sipper for sure. There is a decent amount of sweetness to help balance out the high IBUs.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Bottle dated 8/9/2016 poured into a Dogfish Head Goblet Glass. Pours cloudy orange, light head, a less than expected amount of carbonation. Really strong nose, can pick it up 2 feet away. Very boozy,malty, fruity with a strong caramel bite. First sip feels thick, medium thick like you would expect from stout, but pleasant. Get the hoppy taste, but the taste of burnt sugar helps make the high IBU balance fantastic. As the beer sat and breathed for a bit, it has a more pronounced hoppy taste. Much more reminiscent of an American Barleywine, but I do see the Imperial IPA angle. Very complex beer, aging a few to do a vertical and will see how it changes.

The flavor and aroma are both more perceptible when the beer warms up a bit. Aroma is tropical fruit and caramel malt, a bit of alcohol vapor as you inhale. That alcohol is in the flavor as well. Very warm, & complex. Herbs, spice, fruit and malt. A very strong, yet smooth DIPA with character. Worth trying at least once in your life.

The taste is very warm and boozy. I'm getting some hop bitterness in the aftertaste and I guess I would describe it as herbal to grassy. The mouth is warm with alcohol and there's a light burn to your throat.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Wow this is crazy. Easily the strongest hoppy beer I've ever had. Having on tap at Lucha Cantina.  The appearance is a deep amber with a slight haze. Had a half finger of white head that dissipated quickly.  The aroma is huge caramel malt sweetness and alcohol front and center. Also has pine and earthy dankness.  The taste is a massive sweetness from the caramel malt and alcohol. Also a substantial spicy heat from the high abv. Pine and resiny dankness follow the huge sweetness.  The palate is full with spicy alcohol heat and sweet malt along with a lingering resiny dank bitterness.  Overall this is an extreme example of an imperial ipa that is like an American Barleywine. Definitely feel that 18% although it does not become overpowering.   
look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Bottled on 7-14-16    12oz poured into a north coast tulip. Pours a murky, tawny, orange brown. Frothy foamy 1 finger head. Minimal lacing.    S - wow. As soon as the bottle was cracked hops and alcohol hit my nose from 2 feet away. Up close it smell reminiscent of 90 minute. Piney and dank with tons of malt and caramel alongside it. A heavy whiff and you can really, really smell the alcohol. The potency of the aromas make this a 5.    T - wow. Extremely earthy and greenness in the hop flavor. Immensely potent and immensely spicy, both from the hops and from the alcohol. The taste sticks to my palate and it's almost fatigued between sips that it's hard to recognize all I'm tasting. There's a strange saltiness I'm getting as well. For what it is, I really wouldn't describe it as bitter. In fact, there's almost more sweetness that I'm struck with than pungent ibu's.    M - thick, dry, hot, and extremely filling. Love it here.    Overall I'm only an ounce or 2 in but so far I love it. We'll see if that holds true throughout the rest of the beer or if it becomes excessive towards the end.

Orange, marmalade translucent elixir poured into HF snifter. 1/2 cm of white foam to a rim. Scant lacing. Thick legs coat the glass with each sip.    Sugar coated citrus candy, booze, earth and subtle spice.    The citrus hop is there but quickly overwhelmed by the alcohol. There is a heavy sugar cane presence that mutes the hop bitterness.    Medium to full body, minimally carbonated, alcohol vapors.    This is the first time I have had this brew fresh and the age really helps mellow the alcohol. Drink fresh at your own risk.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Bottled 7/14/2016. Poured into IPA glass. It pours a hazy honey-amber with one-inger of frothy, milk-white head and lacing with excellent retention. It smells of sweet malt, pine needles, hops, and just a whiff of citrus. You can also smell the strong alcohol. When sipped, it fairly explodes with sweet malt, almost cloying, and bitter, biting hops. There is a strong alcohol burn. The sweetness and bitterness are at war with each other. This is probably the most viscous, chewy IPA I've reviewed and the alcohol is nearly overpowering. This is a legendary ale that I'm glad to have finally reviewed. I usually purchase a single bottle when a fresh batch is released. That's enough for me.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I chose to open this guy fresh.     L: A hazy honey, a slightly lighter looking DIPA, lingering head  S: A mixture of Chinook and sweet malt. The alcohol is definitely there but not over powering.   T: Great DIPA that is ridiculously strong. The flavors are so on point that it masks the high ABV. A nice bright hop flavor that is smoothed out with a mellow sweet malty backbone and finishes with the slight kick from the alcohol flavor.  O: A fine beer that is definitely worth the search. Wish I could try some older ones   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This thing is a in a class by itself.   Its a beast.  To me its not a beer, its carbonated Liquor!  Really, its more of a barley wine then an IPA to me...    My first attempt at DFH120 was a fresh bottle - its just different than anything I have had. Not sure how to explain it but its something to check off the list.  I have a 2nd bottle aging for little over a year now, I am anxious to see how it has changed with age........will update review when I have it.

TASTE: juicy, guava, lemon, Orange, ash and barley show up late. Very complex taste. Alocohol is apparent, but not 18% apparent.  FEEL: Full bodied blonde. Very thick, carbonation is there, but has resistance to being bubbly.     Glad I tried this fresh(about 2 months). Aging a 2nd bottle. I've seen argument that this in mislabeled as an IPA, but I think it truly is an IPA, with some characteristics of a barleywine. This reminds me of Troegs Nugget Nectar on Steroids. I'm guessing aging will bring out more of the malty flavors as the hoppy flavors fade.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Finally got around to reviewing one; this is not my first by any means. June 2014 bottle date, my friend Gary reports he cared for it well before I traded him a brewed-that-week Maine Dinner for it. I just wanted to give him a Dinner, to be honest, but he insisted. Good man.     Poured into Teku glass.    L: Neat color and unusual. Very juicebomby looking (it's not that kind of IPA, if IPA it really is) opaque cordovan leather color. Small head after pour, but as you can imagine that did not last long and leaves no trace.    S: Malt and alcohol, but lots of complexities within. You get barley, honey, molasses, brown sugar, dried aged stone fruits, along with cognac, bourbon.    T: Largely follows nose. Sweetness first, bitterness from all the hopping, and alcohol burn come in turn and malts really can't hide that very well. Lots of oaky, bourbon, cognac, leathery type feeling. Really has aged very nicely and all the flavors are mellow and soft.    F: Full bodied, light carbonation, all drying done by ABV and there is a lot of tongue coating. Improved balance with aging, but the sweetness and alcohol burn still peak too high, I think. Well constructed.    O: Why is it not a barleywine? No idea. It's still a very nice superstrong beer when you want to sit around and sip something nice that won't break the bank.

Smells like slightly astringent booze, almost like a sherry wine or cognac style hard liquor, some big grapefruit citrus, red melon, dried fruits, dark toffee, caramel, honey, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, with earthy herbal pine. Tastes like slightly bitter boozy heat, an almost dessert wine-like note, dried fruits, red grapefruit, melons, dark toffee, caramel, honey, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, with bitter earthy herbal pine. Feels medium bodied, creamy and slick with moderate carbonation. Overall a nice strong bitter and boozy IPA.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 Graciously given to me as an extra in a trade by member newbeeraday.     Bottled on 6/30/14. Aged a couple years, it looks like.       The pour is beautiful, just a golden froth the color of OJ from the bottle. It forms into what I can only describe as Tropicana or fruit juice. Lots of reds, oranges, heck it even looks like a tomato beer. The head is 1 finger but diminishes very quickly to moss on top. 100% opaque, but sunlight gloriously illuminates the sides. A beautiful, stunning appearance.    Aromas of ocean tides, melon, papaya, dark skinned grape, prunes, raisin, a hint of burnt brown sugar, freshly uncapped barley in a barrel. It really is an amazing nose.     Holy shit. I mean holy, freaking, shit. Insane beer. Flavor just jumps out at you. Each sip is different. I'm getting figgy fruits (that is to say, dark...plum, prune, raisin), and bright fruits like cantaloupe, melon, and honeydew. An aggressive dry hopped character hits you in the face with what I imagine some high quality space dust would taste like from another planet. I'm also getting tomato soup notes, which sounds bad but isn't, and finishing off with a a vinous quality, wine casks, and bourbon barrel. And I just noticed it's 18%. whoops. If there were anything to improve on, it's that the alcohol comes out more as it warms and takes over the beer.     Feel is hot, smothering, creamy, yet intensely carbonated. Hot, dry finish.     Overall, I mean...what can you improve on this? Insanity in a bottle. The warmth makes it a bit medicinal and hard to swallow, but if this is what NE IPA's are like, count me the F in. This is awesome right here.

Transparent w/ some suspended particles. Half finger thick, off white colored head, soapy, dissipates quickly. Tons of alcohol legs, some spotty head lacing on glass.    Aroma- Candied fruity sweetness, orange marmalade, lemon, sweet pineapple, apricots, and white grapes. Sweet breadiness, glazed fruitcake, honey, brown sugar. Some earthy pine and grapefruit. Boozy alcohol notes.    Taste- Sweet bready malts, caramel, honey, molasses. Candied orange, booze soaked raisins and dates, cherries, white wine grape. A touch of piney hop on the finish, woody earthiness, and warming alcohol notes.    Feel- Full bodied, very thick and syrupy, coats the mouth. Finishes slightly dryer due to alcohol notes. Lower carbonation.    Overall- Incredible sweetness, layers of bready malts and sugary sweet flavors. Hop character has faded back, just a touch of pine on the finish. Love how the fruity flavors mix so well with the boozy alcohol notes. Its brash and aggressive, very enjoyable.

Flavors are (at first) rather overpowering in hops and booziness. Settling into this, I can appreciate flavors of perhaps grapefruit. On the one hand, I salute Dogfish for this amazing beer. But, being real, I don't see wanting more than one of these per season and I'd never serve it to a guest.

This is a beer but it's a unique creation. Kind of a Hop Port. I guess some would criticize ever giving a perfect score. Imo, a beer that is transcendent, it's own thing and I would't want anything changed deserves it. Kudos Sam and team.

The smell is dank, some citrus, sweet, and boozy. The taste is very sweet, very boozy, and hard to pick out anything else. Mouthfeel is heavy carbonation and oily. Overall, this beer is incredibly intense and a bit difficult to drink. It definitely needs to age. I will revisit this review in a year or two when I open another.    Edit at two years: It's still sweet and sticky but it's much smoother and easier to drink. The hop flavor is more present through the much-reduced alcohol. I'll update in another two years.

Minimal lacing clings to the sides. Smell doesn't really knock my socks off like I expected. Somewhat understated compared to dank Midwest coastal style I prefer. I was expecting a huge resinous smack in the face, and this just didn't deliver that same wallop that some of the better DIPA's deliver. At first sip Initially I was impressed with the sweet malt, barleywine, backbone of this beer. But the longer this lingered on my palate, the medicinal, champagne like, notes overpowered those characteristics, sent this review sideways. I struggle to detect the more desirable hop characteristics I crave. I'm surprised at how underwhelmed I am with his beer, since I am a big fan of both the 60 and 90 minute DFH IPA releases. I guess I'm spoiled by the quality of breweries like Dogfish Head, Founders, Russian River, and the like. I shouldn't expect a smashing success with each years' release of a big name brew. Even Miguel Cabrera strikes out with runners in scoring position on occasion.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 I am going on the assumption that I tried this for much the same reason others have: dry hopped for a month?! crazy high abv?! Dogfish Head?!I consider 60 minute to be a session beer, and 90 min to be a solid hour long sipper, and I imagined this would be like 90 minute, but with a flavor wallop. Instead, it just seemed like they poured some booze into a perfectly good 90 min. Sure this was a bit more complex and layered, but ultimately, I would pick the 90 min every time in the future, especially considering one 120 bottle costs the same as a 4-pack of 90.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours a honey Amber color. Aroma is a little sweet, very resinous and super malty.

A few more as you watch the sun set. Not an everyday beer - for special occasions, or to make an ordinary occasion special. Peace.

Not recommended for the faint of heart - or hops - & to be frank, I would only drink one. Can't imagine sitting down to sip a few of these.    Should have let it sit in the cold barrel another month or two before tapping. Note for September.

look: 2.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.75 Un-aged, as fresh as possible, pouring orange amber, 120 shows a surprising amount of tan carbonation. It sounds like cola, showing a lot of promise, but disappears just as quickly, leaving only champagne like bubbles. The alcohol leaves some legs on the glass, like wine.    Smells like a full-on pine forest, with candy, caramel, and grapefruit combining in such a way I've not experienced before, all coming together as one. Graham and honey aromas surface as it warms, and then some cannabis, gasoline, juniper, tobasco, green apple, and wood. It's intriguing but kind of a hot mess.    Again, hot ass pine forest emerges first in flavor. Actually, it tastes more like a wild fire. Then, grapefruit-cherry cough syrup. This is extreme, but what else would you expect from this? Also got some toast, graham, grain, and corn.    At times, there is an unreal amount of froth on the palate for the style and ABV. But all in all, it is truly wine-like, even without aging. This is some really hot, fire-breath inducing booze.    ---    Since this review, I've had 4 and 3 year old cellared bottles. I noticed the heat did smooth out a bit, and the flavor got sweeter with raisin and a more prominent honey flavor, giving a sort of maple aftertaste. It was still a bit much, but easier drinking, if you're into Wheatwines and Barleywines.

Very little head forms atop of it.    It has a very sweet aroma. I get dates and figs. The hops have completely faded leaving a sweet, syrupy aroma.     It has a really sweet taste. I get fig and dates like in the aroma. Also some brown sugar and molasses are present. It comes across as an English barleywine at this point in its maturity.    Thick, viscous, syrupy mouthfeel    I had been saving it for some reason. Ohio getting the 12% abv law lifted seems like a good reason to drink it. Now I need a fresh one to compare.

Excellent, tasty beer worth aging.

look: 4.25 | smell: 2 | taste: 1.25 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.25 12 oz poured to tulip    Great amber color with nice head, mild haze.    Odd aroma, floral, cough syrup, bandaid, sweet over ripe fruit? Fairly offensive.\    Flavor worse than the aroma. Sickly sweet with little interesting going on either the malt or the hop side.\    Mouth feel is heavy and cloying.    Amazingly hard to get my hands on , don't think I'll bother with it in the future. It's like a wine cooler and a barley wine had kids out of wedlock. They say it ages well, but I don't see how aging is going to clean up this hot mess, other than the offensive aroma maybe dropping off some. Love DFH and I don't think I've ever rated anything from them under 3.5, so this took me by surprise in a big way. Seriously, not a beer I care to purchase again.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pours a nice amber color with a quickly dissipating one finger head. Smell is mostly hops but with a noticeable malty sweetness and a bit of alcohol. Taste follows the smell being a little sweeter than one would expect from an imperial IPA. Some alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is very nice, a little sticky. The ABV is very well hidden.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Best IPA I have had yet. Hoppy smooth taste and the high alcohol content doesn't really hit you until much later. I would never have guessed how strong this one was.    Update- I aged a few bottles. At 2 years it is remarkably smooth and more caramel type flavors.

A- Opens well and pours a nice 1/2"high white head that lasts for nearly 5mins before film out. Nice dark gold almost a honey colour. WOW.     S- Sweet. Malt. Hops. WOW. Has an at the end popsicle scent. Nice    T- Hops. Hops. Hops. This is a barley wine and an IPA combined. Very good. Keep going boys as this is a wonderful blend between barley wine and imperial pale ale. The barley wine wins out. Nice experience to say the least. A nice flavor experience and I want them to keep going this way    M- Sticky and sweet and expected    O- Nice brew. I like this one. Has a heavy hop and huge malt presence. Super rich and thick. I like this one a lot. One thing you should do is split as one bottle is a lot.    Food Pairing  This wonderful IPA slash barley wine went well with........ Sticky pork sweet and sour bamboo salad with peppers, onion and garlic. Touch of ginger, brown sugar. Very good to throw in a smidgeon of whole grain mustard. Super nice. Enjoy    Thx Dave   
look: 2.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 My coworker offered me a 12 oz. bottle of this from the office minifridge since our kegerator was tapped out. Bottled on 4/18/14! Poured into a plastic cup.    Look: Yellowish brown and very cloudy. A lot of sediment came out of the bottom of the bottle at the end of the pour. Not a looker!    Smell: Sweet, intensely malty, fruity, boozy. Golden raisins. Not too much hoppiness.    Taste: Very hard-hitting. Extremely boozy, sweet, and a little bitter. Pretty tasty!    Feel: Syrupy. Thick body with not much carbonation.    Overall: I think this 2-year-old bottle has aged very well. Not too hoppy anymore, but still extremely boozy and flavorful.

This beer is all hops.    The taste begins with a pronounced caramel maltiness as the high carbonation tickles your tongue. The hops come crashing down quickly - but the sweetness brings out more of a citrusy flavour, like a slightly-off tangerine, or those chocolate covered orange rind candies. The hops linger on the palate, seemingly forever. I will taste hops until the day I die.     Overall, it's a pleasant deviation from "enormous hop bomb" but still not going to be attractive to people who are not hop bomb fans.

Tastes more like a barleywine: sweet caramel mostly. An almost complete lack of bitterness shows the IBU rating has little to do with perceived bitterness. Feel is thick and sticky. Overall a unique beer, quite good, and not exactly like anything I've ever had.

T - Amazingly malty for an IPA. Drinks closer to a barleywine but remains balanced by the extreme hoppiness buried within. Definite alcohol burn at the end.    F - Solid mouth feel, almost closer to that of a stout than an IPA. Mouth feel almost dissipates due to the high APV.    O - Insanity in a bottle. Malt, hops, burn and repeat.

It is appropriate to call it an amber color.     S: slightly hoppy and quite malty, a slight sweetness to it. Very attractive because it led me to think its not a hop bomb. It's a pleasant smell and unique to the style     T: what can I say? This taste is unique hoppy and honey sweet at the same time. Reminds me of the syrupy sweetness of a stout with the very sticky syrup mouthfeel. Taste is fantastic if you like hops and sweet stouts. This high ABV is hidden by excellent flavors.     F: The carbonation is good. Mouthfeel dissapates, appropriate for the style. Wonderful feel for this Style. Excellent and superb for me.     O: excellent brew. Which is was more available.the only downside I can see to this brew (ignoring strong ABV) is that it's hard to get. The finish is fantastic to my palate and draws me in for more. Head dissapated Quckly but who cares when the beer has a wonderful taste. I would like to have this more often and even would have a place among my stouts. The high ABV allows more complex flavors. I am extremely happy with this Dogfish head brew. It blows 90 minute out of the water and creates a style I love. If you can pick this up definitely due. I can't wait to see how my others age. One of the best dogfish brews.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Nothing bad to say about this beer besides that it's boozy as f***!     Look: Looks like an IPA with a lot more malt than a regular IPA.     Smell: Smells like alcohol. Getting a berry note with a ton of butterscotch and some hops in the background.     Taste: Holy shit, this batch is boozy. I'm not getting a ton of hops but I'm getting the berry note with some fruit and a bunch of butterscotch.     Feel: The feel is super dangerous for this beer. You would have no clue that you were drinking an 18+% beer if you had this in front of you. It's too smooth almost.     Overall: I really love this beer and really enjoyed the last few batches but I feel that this batch fell a bit short. I will see how age does this.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Was a bit scared of this one prior to opening as i expected a brutally hoppy ipa, this actually drank more like a sweet barleywine but it was still pretty boozy.

Caramel and honey come to mind. Big and bold, multi layer hop. Surprisingly well balanced.    Super heavy body. Light carbonation. Finish is dry and sticky at the same time.    An excellent triple IPA. Flavorful, complex, intensely hoppy, yet balanced.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 | overall: 4 Had this one special ordered and waited about a month to get a fresh 12oz. Honestly, they probably should not release this right after brewing after the 1 month of dry hopping. Has a very syrupy taste to it, sugar comes through more than an IPA hoppy taste. Probably needs more fermentation to convert that sugar to alcohol. Will let the other one I bought sit for some time. I am updating this after letting 1 sit a few more weeks. It needs at least ~2months at least to age before that 90m flavor comes into the brew, along with the IPA smell. Going to buy a couple more and let them sit longer. Just sip this one to bring out the flavor AND let this thing age a bit!!!    Update I am terrible when it comes to aging beer as I drink it too fast. I did just pickup a 2017 vintage and fresh it takes better than 2016. Still very syrupy no bitterness though that I prefer on a DIPA but that's Dogfish brewery for you. Good, not great with a $10/12oz bottle price. Maybe a 6 month aging would turn the syrup into alcohol. I will attempt to store one that long...

The high alcohol content masks the maltiness and there is strong citrus-sweetness to the front end of the beer (I don't get the bitterness score for this beer), following by a strong burn of alcohol. Value wise, one would be better off buying a 90 Minute Dogfish (which is a really good beer!) and adding a shot of vodka to it.    Again, it's a novelty beer so definitely get one and try it yourself.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Fresh ass bottle... bottled 4/8, poured 5/4. I know, people say to age it or whatever, well I wanted to try it fresh. $12 for a 12oz bottle. My "May the 4th be With You" beer. Off we go.    Appearance: Who saw that coming? This is a hazy copper orange color with half a finger of a creamy head and a fair amount of lacing. I was anticipating a flat looking beer... this looks fantastic.    Smell: Intensely huge. Lots of alcohol, but also quite a bit of fruity hops with great malt sweetness. For some reason, all together, I actually get a slight maple syrup aroma out of this at times which I think is phenomenal... now that I'm thinking about it, maple syrup barrel aged IPA, anyone?    Taste/feel: Well, follows the nose. What a monster. The alcohol in one sense is really well hidden -- I don't think this is a very hot beer. It's not burning me going down. Also, I don't find that it dries my mouth up after every sip. However... there's a definite boozy taste, but that's to be expected at 18%. Pretty intense alcohol flavor up front fades with loads of fruity and tropical tasting hops with a surprisingly not overbearing amount of malt sweetness... I figured this would be super sweet, boozy, and hot, and it's not all that. The feel is syrupy in body, but there's a nice bit of lively carbonation to balance it out.    First sniff and taste I wasn't huge on this... but it has grown on me. This beer reminds me of Moltov Cocktail Heavy just in that it's the only triple IPA I've had at 18%. For me, Heavy is a slightly sweeter and definitely hotter beer with a little more flavor depth. 120 is actually a little bitter (or at least less sweet), but the flavors aren't quite as good.    120 is fabulous. It's definitely a beer that's maybe too intense for its own good, but that's the point of it. I know Dogfish says this ages well, but I don't know if I would bother doing that as it would just taste like sweet booze.. I enjoy the hop characteristics and everything that it is right now. If I had a handful of bottles, I'd try aging one, but to me, you're better off drinking this one fresh.

Small head dissipates pretty quickly but leaves a thin ring. No lacing.    Smell opens very piney although I wouldn't go as far as 'dank'. When that drifts away its left with a mostly alcohol/solvent smell.    Taste is very much like the smell, except the pine and fruity hops are buried and I just get a lot of alcohol burn. I tried it chilled and then let it warm, and either way it came off hot. Slightly more malts present when it warms, but they're fighting a losing battle with the 18% abv.    Feel is hard to judge, as another review stated, my mouth is basically numb and whatever feel it does have is not very enjoyable. Its medium body I guess and not as flat as I expected, but thats about as much as I can say.    Overall, this is a bummer. I know its kind of a novelty beer at 18%, but I was expecting it to be somewhat more beer-like... Wish I had my $10 back!   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 A- Pours a clear amber color with a slightly tan, foamy head that dissipates quickly, leaving a fair amount of alcohol lacing on the glass.    S- Very sweet burnt sugar notes right up front, with some alcohol in the nose along with an array of roasted malts and hoppy pine smells. Liquid caramel, molasses, definitely not for those who don't like sweetness in their beers. The alcohol in this almost tastes like the bourbon you would get from barrel aging, which earns this beer massive points for me.     T- Follows the nose, with a huge punch of that burnt sugar sweetness and dried fruits, almost a syrupy kind of malt to the flavor with a definitive alcohol kick at the end. There's hop bitterness, but it's just enough to balance out the amazing amount of sweetness in this beer. Almost like a dessert in a glass, or a tasty, high end liqueur.    F- Full bodied and thick for an IPA, but you would expect that with an IPA of this strength.     O- Wow, this beer was simply amazing. This is my new favorite IPA of all time, and it was worth every penny I paid for it. This is one hyped beer that definitely lives up to the reputation for me.

I've always been a fan of 60, 90, and chicory stout, but Sam Calagione's general attitude and approach to brewing has always driven me up a wall. Rather than putting forth ANY effort to craft a decent, nuanced beer, he makes novelties. I'd knock them for just trying to remain relevant, but it's always been their approach. "I bet if I brew this beer to 55% abv, use an old board game to create a continuous hopping mechanism, and include an ingredient from every continent, History Channel will give me a show!"    This beer is pretty bad, and people give it decent ratings only because it's a novelty. Oh yeah, don't age it. Dogfish never really understood cellaring beer, and when they realized same, they peppered their website with nonsense like "people may tell you that you shouldn't age fresh, hoppy ales, but remember, do what you love." If you give this a full year in pitch black at cellar temps, it comes out tasting like the same beer but more astringent. A true disaster.     Look: Actually good. Incredible amount of legs on the thing because it's Port strength. 3.5    Smell: Alcohol. Incredibly astringent. There may even be a beer down there that wants to smell like something, but it can't. 2.25    Taste: Alcohol. Again, please note, there is a beer under there, and you may taste some fruity hops trying to punch through. This might entice you to let this beer age for a while, but don't be fooled. Those beer flavors are the first to go when this baby spends some time in a cellar. 2.5    Feel: I don't even know; my mouth is numb. I would guess 190 proof everclear mixed with orange juice, but I haven't touched that since high school, so I can't confirm. I think I'll say 2.25    Overall: Go away Dogfish. 2.5

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Poured sunset orange with one inch fluffy white head that had good retention and lacing. Scent was potent bitter/piney hops with a bit of citrus. Flavor is absolute hop bomb. Almost tastes like I'm chewing a hop pellet, then washing it down with a beer. The good thing is I am a fan of really hoppy beers. Although I think it's a bit much, I can appreciate what went into this beer. Mostly piney/bitter flavor with a bit of citrus, followed up with sweet malty backbone and a boozy heat. I enjoy having one per year...

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 This is a somewhat puzzling beer.  Color: a nice deep bronze  Smell: There is some citrus and ripe banana there, but it is hard to get through the alcohol. I'm also a Scotch drinker so I'm used to prominent alcohol on the nose but here there's not much after the alcohol dissipates.  Taste: again some citrus fruit but there mostly a dominant sweetness to it that is followed immediately by a bitter finish and the alcohol level is out of control here.  The best way I can describe it would be to say that it taste like burned sugar with a spoonful of cointreau.  Right now the 2016 it is just not a very pleasant beer to drink. For some reason, I have a feeling that this is going to age well, but who knows...

look: 3.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.75 Pours a deep gold/orange/copper...may be bronze is the best way to describe this? I'm instantly turned off by this because I don't think I can like an IPA this dark. The head is off white, which was more apparently initially. It's not exactly bursting with aroma. I feel like all I get is rubbing alcohol. Despite it being listed as having 120 IBUs, this is incredible sweet. It is very boozy too. It's not undrinkable, but not exactly something you can throw down. I am not surprised that aging is recommended. This is a beer with minimum refinement. Calling this would be a barleywine would be kind with this amount of bitter hop character. This is an extreme but not a very good beer.

Looks dark gold, thin white head. Aroma was super boozy to the point of almost thinking fusel alcohol, but no, its just super hot.     Taste is a thick, viscous almost barleywine like double ipa, excessive bitterness. If you like bitter vodka shots, this is your jam.     When I think overrated sticky high alpha hop methodology with little hop flavor, this be thy name.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 If whiskey were a beer, basically. The first beer I've tried that's this massive. It was legendary before I had the opportunity to sip, and it really tastes more or less like I would expect it to: the alcohol of a rich red wine, the balanced malt-and-hop-bitterness of the 90 minute IPA, but highly refined. The only strike against this beer is that it is so refined as to be unbeerlike in nearly every way.    Had a Westmalle Tripel after this, and actually think that was better, despite love-love-loving IPAs and Dogfish Head.    Still, not complaining one bit. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I savored every drop of it. Not sure how much it would set me back to fund the tasting myself (the fellow who shared it got it from a friend himself), but I'd be willing to buy it to share the experience with the uninitiated.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 L: Pours a very pretty burnt orange color a good deal of haze and a tight white head. Minor suspended sediment. Superb head retention and lacing. Really a beautiful looking beer.    S: Smells like Bigfoot on steroids. Tightknit caramel and bready malt, piney resinous hops, and a certain toastiness. Pretty sweet but in a hop-forward American barleywine sort of way. Not nearly as much booze as you’d expect for such a big beer.     T: What a massively flavorful beer! Big caramel sweetness and doughy bread crusts, with piney high alpha-acid hops. Some orange zest citrus in there. A good deal more ethanol than the aroma lets on. Rich, boozy, bready sweet finish with loads of classic American hop flavors. Grassy hops flavors take over very late in the finish.    F: Full-bodied with creamy carbonation and an all-around lush and sticky mouthfeel. Quite hot – almost as if drinking spirits – but what the hell do you expect at 15-20% abv?    Thoughts: More of an American Barleywine than a DIPA. Pretty damn good for such a big beer. I don’t usually like my DIPAs to too high up there but I liked this better and found it more drinkable than the vast majority of 10+% abv stouts. This beer is not for everybody by any stretch and it’s no surprise that few other breweries have tried to replicate this style, but it’s a classic for a reason.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 This is my second one, and unlike the first that I drank right away, this one has been sitting for a few months, so one would think it had, if anything, mellowed, but it seems boozier. The pour is a nice moderate head, without being rambunctious or timid. The color is a dark, cloudy amber that is appealing but not astounding.    One of the unique characteristics is that it offers something fine both cold and warm, which is different than how I remember my first, which seemed to only come alive when it warmed. Whereas many beers just don't let the flavor through when they're below 50 degrees, IMO, this one has a nice mellow, moderately malty and crisp IPA vibe, with that refreshing temp. Warmer, it adds body and starts accentuating more of the beer's malty and restrained but clear hoppy flavors.    I don't like it as much as I remember, but as I'm not at all an IPA fan, this is still one of the few that I think is worth drinking. Beware the ABV, though. Preferably drink at home and over the entire course of the evening. If nothing else, to get the progression from its colder experience to room temp. I think I might prefer the 90 minute, though.

I am told that it was much harsher when young. Pours a hazy golden orange with a light tan head. Huge hop aromas of citrus and pine, sweet malt. Tastes of candied fruit and piney citrusy hops as expected. Strong alcohol burn. This is what I would imagine a hop wine to taste like. The aging (according to my friend who tried it when fresh) seemed to have made it much more palatable. Will have to try again fresh if only to see the difference. Worth seeking out if you can get your hands on it!

It aged like a dream and didn't seem to have dropped anything worthy out.

T - rock candy up front, sweet malt in the middle, hops and alcohol in the back. Sweet but bitter.     F - very strong, not a slammer by any means. Slow sipper all the way. Boozy the whole way.    O - this is more like hop wine than a beer. Super strong and bitter. Not so much a hop bomb but very balanced. Love Dogfish Head and what they do. Certainly pushes the limits of all IPA fans

Huge dark fruits and complex malt. Cherries, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, figs, plums, raisins, brandy, and vanilla.    Taste: Molasses, toffee, brown sugar, cashews, cherries, figs, prunes, raisins, brandy/cognac/port wine, red wine, and vanilla. The hops take a backseat to the insanely complex malts but there is some faint grapefruit, orange, and grass. There is some expected alcohol heat on the swallow and aftertaste, but it isn't overpowering like I would expect. This drinks like a twelve or thirteen percenter, not eighteen, but it's definitely a sipper.    Feel: Full-bodied, slick, oily, but with some light carbonation. Lingering stickiness of brown sugar sweetness and citrusy hop character.

Pours a hazy red-orange with minimal white head --- looks more like a Tree House IPA than I was expecting. Smell is boozy and sweet - not much hop aroma, more like a barleywine. Taste is similar, with definite sweet and boozy notes, but more bitter than a traditional barleywine - hops still coming through here, a little pine. Still, I wouldn't guess IIPA here. Pretty well carbonated for a year old beer - nice mouthfeel. Glad to try it but not my style.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Another one that has somehow escaped my reviewing, one that I have from time to time, and with New Years looming figured it was a nice time to do it. 03/16/14 got a bit of age, but I like these better with a year or two on them.    Pours a decent foamy fizzy 1/2 finger head that fades at a med pace, nice head for a beer of this high abv, decent lacing too, murky reddish orange color.    NOse brings a mix of characters, like a piney citrus barleywine, plenty of piney hops, not mosaic like pine but a spicy earthy pine, bright floral piney hops, with more orange peel and citrus as well, candied orange peel, a mix of candied stone fruit like an apricot style thing. Big candy malt, caramel, a little toffee biscuit, amber malts, toasty malts and big malty aroma in general, but tons of various candy aromas.    Taste brings more sweet flavors, tons of sweet malts, toasty amber malts, pale malts, some caramel, biscuity notes, etc., but again most of all candy characters, candied malts, caramel toffee etc. Mild fruits, again candied stone and tree fruits, candied apricots, a little orange and tangerine notes, candied orange peel and sweet citrus, even a touch of white raisin. Fair booze warmth, not nearly as boozy as it should be which is why I like to give it a year or two, it's boozy fresh, some esters with that, faint phenols, and fair bitterness. Hops also bring a little pine zesty note, but not much. Finish is sticky sweet but dries a bit, more booze tingle coming through a bit, with sticky candied pine notes, as well as candied tree and stone fruits again, touch of citrus, and generic big sweet malt.    Mouth is med to a bit heavier bod, a little syrupy sweet, nice fluffy carb, some warming tingly booze but not a ton.    Overall def a unique and interesting beer. Fresh it's a bit too much of everything, a year or two gives it a lot of character and makes it at least tolerable in drinkability. A legend of it's own that just about lives up to it's potential, but isn't a beast or whale in any aspect, just a legendary beer everyone needs to try at some point.

Over at a friends house drinking things from his cellar and when he brought up a 4 year old 120 minute. I was skeptical at first being a fresh IPA drinker. Really unlike anything I've ever had in a good way! The hops at this point were almost gone, but there was a slight bitter aftertaste that lingered. Mostly this was very sweet with the sweetness/malts shining through. Slight alcohol on the nose but nothing in the flavor. At this point it's probably 20% so that's saying something. The bottle says "ages well" and they really aren't kidding. If you have the will power to age one of these for 3-5 years I suggest giving it a try!

Bottle (dated 07/22/15) from Mary for Christmas purchased at Copper Vine, poured into a Stone IRS snifter.    A - A normal pour creates 1-finger of dense, khaki head. The body is a very hazy, burnt orange, looking almost like a pulpy fruit juice. There are small bubbles consistently making their way toward the surface behind the cloudy body. The head sustains at 1/4 finger ring around the edges, and a thin, lacy film through the middle. There are really nice, lacy rings left on the glass.    S- I'm initially hit by a load of hops, mostly grapefruit, but there's a big, sweet, malt backbone behind it that comes off as caramel or English toffee. Another whiff and the aroma melds into a tobacco leaf and leathery goodness. Within the sweetness, the alcohol becomes apparent. Not harsh, but something of fruit brandy (like apricot or even a cherry cordial). Hops become more spicy too.    T- Whoa! There's a lot going on here. Very sweet up front, something like brown sugar and maple syrup. Then the hops kick in through the middle, bringing a leafy and spicy quality. The finish is a combination of the sweet and hoppy. More of the brown sugar, but with a juicy hop that combines grapefruit and spicy aspects. Things don't change too much with warmth, but become more pronounced. The spicy hops begin to hint at freshly cracked black pepper toward the end.    M- Very full bodied. High viscosity. The hops provide a spicy bite and combine with the extreme ABV that adds a smooth, warm heat. All in all, the finish becomes rather dry after the syrupy sweet mouthful.    O- I'm so glad my wife pulled the trigger for me. I've been tempted every time I see it on the shelf, but walked away due to the cost combined with an apprehension over the perceived flavor profile. This is definitely a one and done sipper for the evening, but I'd be more than tempted to pick up a few more, maybe one to drink fresh and one to lay down for some aging.    4.5 4.5 4.25 4.25 4.25

Pours very hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, lemon peel, pineapple, tangerine, peach, mango, citrus rind, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of bright citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon peel, pineapple, tangerine, peach, mango, citrus rind, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon peel/rind, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Good amount of dryness from bitterness and spicy alcohol on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately crisp/sticky, and lightly creamy/slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with a light-moderate warmth lingering after the finish with zero booziness. Overall this is an outstanding DIPA, especially considering the ABV. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. Extremely surprised and impressed with this vintage, as there is still a ton of hop complexity present and it does not feel overly heavy or malty at all; even after being nearly 3 years old. Other vintages I have had at similar age have been much sweeter and a bit cloying. A highly enjoyable offering.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 I drove four hours for the privilege of finally having this beast on tap at the Dogfish Head 20 Beers for 20 Years event at World of Beer in St. Petersburg, Florida on Friday night. I came for the 120 and stayed for all the other great brews that DH has to offer, and this monster alone – my very first 120 Minute – was well worth every mile.    Served on draught into a snifter as a far too generous pour for something with this high an ABV. Damn, I am grateful to the bartender, but it looks like I won't be going anywhere for a while tonight...    L: Hazy bright orange-copper topped with a thin ring of head displaying good retention and solid, sticky lacing.    S: Fruitcake and booze, all the way. Surprisingly not a lot in the way of classically recognizable hops in the nose, but the distinctive fruitcake aroma is quite inviting. I'm not a fruitcake hater, unlike as is the fashion, but I'm not exactly a huge fan either. However I will say that if fruitcake tasted as delicious as this smelled, I would absolutely enjoy the Christmas season quite a bit more.    T: BOOZE. Wow. This wicked brew gives you about a second of false security after hitting the tongue before quickly building the alcohol to a punch in the face crescendo, backed by a short blast of prickly carbonation over a strong malty backbone, accompanied by a vibrant and solid kick of flamboyant citrus and piney resinous hops. The booziness reaches a sharp spike and then gradually trails off to reveal a malty maraschino cherry flavor with a bit of a medicinal note, before melting away to more completely showcase the hop profile. As many others have said, being so strong and malty this beer definitely has quite a bit of a barleywine character but, amazingly, this is still, somehow, resolutely an IPA. At eighteen goddamn percent. I don't know which volcano and/or ancient god these guys sacrificed a virgin to in order to pull off this brewing miracle, but hoo lawd, well done!    F: Thick and resinous, this stuff coats the tongue and sticks around for quite some time after every sip. Not an absolutely complete palate-wrecker, but balancing on a knife edge of that distinction. You won't think you're drinking water, that's for damn sure.    O: Wonderful. An incredibly unique and well-crafted bruiser of a brew, this was an absolutely sublime experience and well worth the wait. I can now die happy.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.75 Enjoyed on draft at Knob Hill Tavern in Newburgh, IN, so a fresh taste!    Appearance: Poured an opaque amber into snifter. Little suds at all.    Aroma: Alcoholic burn, fruitiness. Not over-the-top hops as would be expected. This is an entirely different beast at 18%!    Taste: Fruity, but with a definite and pronounced alcohol heat. This one’s sweeter, rather than bitter hoppy, weirdly. Most certainly a heavy brew, and one to sip, 120 Minute leaves a burn on the tongue like a harder alcohol, rather than a traditional beer. Very glad to have finally tried this landmark IPA, but not one I’d seek out again, either, especially at the price.

Glad I got to try it, but I won't go out of my way to have this one again. The look & smell is fine, but the taste is very strong, and the alcohol "burn" is very pronounced. The 60 & 90 minute IPAs are much more enjoyable.
