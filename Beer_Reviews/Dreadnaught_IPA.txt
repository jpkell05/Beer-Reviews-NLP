Aroma hoppy malt with grapefruit, pineapple, orange, and hints of dank pine.   Taste starts sweet - caramel malt with citrus - orange, grapefruit, mango, followed by finishing piney bitterness that is super well balanced with the malt. Mouthfeel is full - slightly astringent - leaving with a fantastic sticky coating bitterness.

Appearance: Mostly clear copper-amber color. Persistent thin off-white foam. Lots of strands and sheets of persistent lacing.     Smell: Grapefruit, pine, peach, mango, orange.     Taste: Grapefruit, peach, mango, orange rind, a solid caramel malt middle, and a bitter finish with more grapefruit and pine.     Mouthfeel: Nicely thick, good carbonation, a definite stickiness on the teeth due to all the hops.     Overall / Drinkability: Intense, but all the hops are nicely balanced by the right amount of malt sweetness. Dangerously drinkable with well-hidden alcohol. Went well with mac and cheese and I'll definitely have to pick this one up again to pair with some other meals.

Stored in the beer fridge upon our return to PHX.    Beer poured golden orange with a very nice white head that has some great hang time.    Nose is fresh citrus forward, very nice.    Taste is grapefruit and orange forward over a large malt body. Finish has a nice medium touch of rind to let you know this is an IPA.    Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, very refreshing yet very smooth.    Overall a very good double IPA! Back before the craft beer explosion this was one of those holy grail beers and i am happy to finally try it many years later!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 L- Has much the same look as the golden beers. Slightly cloudy, but transparent towards the edges. Beautiful to look at, especially with a perfect pour.    S- Not to give anything away, but the beer smells delicious, just as the beer does itself. I think the sight of the beer provides you with an anticipation of whats to come.    T- It's technically an imperial indian pale ale, but it has a unique flavor that has been very seldom overshadowed, IMO. I would highly recommend this beer for something not TOO boozy, but as tasty as it gets.    O-I can see this going to become one of my go to beers when I'm the midwest. I live in the W US, so these are seldom available to us. Hell, just buy a few kegs and make it last a while.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 From tasting notes 10/14/17  Had on-tap at 3 Floyds Brewing in Munster, IN    Appearance - Served in a 10oz nonic glass, slight haze and golden orange in  color with a white, solid layer of suds across the surface that thickens around the edges. Lacing coats the glass in massive amounts of broken sheeting.    Smell - Strong citrusy aroma that hits on both grapefruit and orange notes. Faint breadiness. 4    Taste - Follows the nose. Orange upfront with a light grapefruit bitterness. Hints of toasted bread and, once it warms, emerging caramel. Light, lingering grapefruit pith notes.    Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with light carbonation. Slick, easy drinker with a slightly watery finish.    Overall - An easy drinking DIPA that sacrifices full flavor in favor of drinkability. I much prefer a more complete flavor experience, but to each their own.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from 22oz (650ml) bottle into glass. Bottle on date is '4-11-17'.  Somewhat cloudy, orange/amber body, persistent white cap and considerable lacing.  At its age, aroma is somewhat muddled, with citrus and peach noted.  Taste of mango, peach, and citrus, with caramel. Still very tasty. Good amount of bitterness but tempered by sweetness.  Fuller, mouth coating, slight syrup in the mouth feel.   Outstanding Imperial IPA. Will purchase this any chance I get. Hides ABV very well.

T - Slightly sweet, strong piney hops, with a clean grain finish    F - Slick hop oils on the tongue, slightly dry at the end.    Another solid 3 Floyds DIPA. Crisp, with clean well-balanced flavors. Strong, but not nuclear to the taste buds.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 From @FFFjunkie's BIF box. Poured from 22 oz. bottle into 3 Floyd's pint glass. It pours a cloudy, medium amber color with orange hues, and an enormous, foamy, ecru-colored head and tons of lacing that persisted through the pour. It's really attractive. The nose is malt-forward with subdued tangerine, pineapple, resinous pine, and floral hops. This is delicious! The first thing I taste is fairly sweet malt followed by tart grapefruit and lemon. There follows sweeter fruit: tangerine and pineapple. As if that's not enough the finish is a battle between creamy caramel and fairly biting hops. The overall taste is complex and pleasing; the flavors all blend really nicely. The mouth feel is pleasantly creamy with moderate carbonation and with its 9.5% ABV and 100 IBU, it's not for the faint of hearted. Overall, this DIPA has it all: it's attractive bold, complex flavors, and a pleasing mouth feel. I'm enjoying it immensely!

Tastes starts with the juicy orange, pineapple. Finishes with a somewhat sweet caramel toffee like malt presence.  Very smooth medium body. Alchohol was very well hidden until it started to warm a bit.  Overall a really tasty brew!

A nice clean bitterness throughout without the bite at the end. Hides the high ABV very well. Very smooth medium bodied IPA. One of the best for sure.

S - citrusy. Lemonade orange. Sweet and bready. Not overly exertive here though.    T - wow. Better than I expected. Huge on flavor. Dank, resinous, and at the same time malty and sweet. It reminds me of DFH 90 minute with its malty backend.    M - absurdly creamy. It's a milksstout of an ipa. Quite a bit of heat for 9.5%, almost tastes and feels closer to 12-13%.    O - There are many "top 250" beers that I don't agree should be there, this however, after my initial impression seems fitting. Like most all beers though, I'd prefer this in a standard format. Especially after digging into this and noting it's immensely filling nature. Good thing I have a bottle capper.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I poured half of this into a tulip and about the other half into a snifter. The appearance was a nice looking hazy to almost transparent looking golden orange to brown with a decent looking sediment rolling around and within the carbonation. The head is fairly a white to an off-white sort of fluffiness filling the top of the glass evenly and ends up leaving a decent sort of white foamy lacing all around the glass. The smell was an authentic sort of citrus hops to somewhat a nice caramel maltiness that doesn’t leave anything to be desired. It does what it needs to do. The taste was a pure bittersweet and does what it should to please the tastebuds in a very nice showing of citrus to caramel-ness coating them. There is a slight aftertaste of bittersweetness, but isn’t overbearing. There is a quick dry finish. On the palate, she sits about a medium with a sipper sort of sessionability to it. The carbonation is quite fulfilling and nice. Overall, I say this was a great DIPA, well worthy of having again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Mostly clear orange color with three fingers of off-white head that leave heavy lacing.    Light aroma with a definite floral and tropical element --maybe lychee, maybe mango, maybe papaya -- but delicate and perfume-like. The tropical note also gives a faint nutty, buttery impression which may or may not be due to the malt. It's pleasant nonetheless.    Definitely unique tasting, again with the tropical flower thing going up front. Maybe a little vanilla. A little strawberry. A twist of lemony citrus. And then some dull, tea-like bitterness on the backend.     It's medium to heavy bodied with some slight prickliness in the feel.    This heads in a different direction than most DIPAs. I'd love sipping this on the side of Kilauea. It reminds me of this cocktail I had in Volcano once with a Hawaiian flower in it whose name I just can't recall.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Wow, Dreadnaught from Three Floyds, is an extremely good Imperial IPA (ABV 9.50%, IBU 100). I got it via a beer trade I can see on the price tag left on that the guy who bought it paid 12 bucks (or $11.99). Why do all prices end with 99 in the US? Anyway, if I had paid for it I certainly would have thought it was well worth the money.    Look: semi-clear to cloudy copper hue with a one-inch inch white head.    Aroma: it has a wonderful piney and fruity aroma.    Taste: There's some sweetness, toasted caramel, and lots of fruit, grapefruit, peach, mango, and lots of pine to top it off. Quite delicious.    Feel: medium body and carbonation and its juicy.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a bomber into a Teku glass. Huge citrus and mango aroma right from the bottle on the pour. A hazy orange color with a one-finger white head. Aroma in the glass has the fruit, and also malt - caramel and some toffee. Bitter orange marmalade flavor, mixed with tropical fruit. The malt is prominent with bread and a bit of caramel. Clean and dry on the finish.

The lacing was spread out down the glass.    Smell- Some citrus and grapefruit comes through but the malty alcohol comes through.     Taste- Very hop forward with a nice blend of the citrus fruits. The alcohol is well hidden making this super drinkable for a DIPA.     Mouthfeel- Lots of carbonation with a nice crisp finish.     Overall- A fantastic DIPA without the boozy flavor you expect from a brew at almost 10% ABV. A fantastic change from the NE IPAs I have been drinking. Definitely get this one if you have a chance.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 L - pours a striking copper bronze. Reminds me of the last little bit of a summer evening sunset. Rich, boisterous head packed full of fluff and foam. White on top, tan on the bottom.     S - strong, penetrating aromas of candied peach and mango. Vanilla and resiny pine. Caramel malt.     T - pure hops. Earthy. Sticky pine and glowing flavors of orange candy and the gooey center of Milk Duds. Loads of malts and hops. Resonating bitterness clashes with the rich, frothy, sweet caramel candy.     F - like a candy milkshake. This is so decadent. There's definitely a syrupy booziness that is dense as can be. It's like it should be highly carbonated, but all those bubbles are densely packed together for what results in relatively low carbonation and a huge, thick, juicy body. Mmmm...    O - a classic that sets the standard for hopped up IPAs. Has the extreme malt character I love with an assault of oily, resiny hops. This is a big beer.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 This has been a long standing favorite. It is really nice to have after drinking NE style for a while. It soothes the palate with toasted caramel and sweet cream after a nose and front end of intense pepper, vanilla and pine and overall hoppiness. Some may not like the heavy malt back end. But give it a chance. It is highly complex and pretty good by a fire right now. The malty sweetness is balanced by the creamy mouth feel.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Translucent amber color. Aroma is hop candy, candied oranges, ripe grapefruit flesh with brown sugar on top, malt, and pine resin. Taste is orange, Apple, and honey on the front of the tongue. As it crosses the mid palate I get darker fruits like dates and dark cherries. The finish is orange peel and pine resin with hop bitterness. Also salt and pepper as it warms. This is a sweet, sticky beer that lingers on the palate, but the carbonation and light mouth feel keep it in check. It's going to be too sweet for some people, but I appreciate the extra flavors the malt brings out. Also quite drinkable for 10.5%.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a Duvel tulip. Sticker says 11/01/16.    A- Pours a dark amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of surface foam. Semi-resilient lacing leaves tiny specs behind.     S- Lots of orange peel quality in the nose with a plentiful amount of malt backing. Noticeable booze fume.    T- Great balance of fruity hops, assertive bitterness and the usual pretzel bread-like malt character all the FFF beers have. All this along with their distinctive house yeast and very well-hidden ABV makes for a tasty drink.    M- Sharp from the hops with medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.    O- It's about time I got the chance to have this beer since I'm an admitted FFF fanboy. Just like all their other DIPAs, it has an uncanny smoothness to it and a great hop profile backed up by a slightly sweet malt bill. Would reach for this repeatedly if it was available in my market.

Good aromatics, leans citrus and you can pull some sweet caramel malt contribution.    Taste still leans on a high hop quotient, citrus, not all grapefruit, oh no, you feel like you taste notes of tangerine and mandarin orange along with a hefty malt backbone on this one, its not super dry, this brings some crystal malt, but isn't excessively bitter or syrupy even if it has an above average thickness for style . Bomber format isn't the coolest and there is no bottle dating but these usually go pretty quick.

Thick foamy head slowly dissipated leaving a thin white film and tons of sticky lacing.     Smell is very piney and dank. Lots of earthy aromas and some orange undertones.    Taste follows the nose with strong notes of orange, pine, herbal flavors, grass and earth.    Feel is thick and sweet, smooth. medium carbonation. It's drinks like a DIPA all the way.     Overall it's a well crafted beer but just not my preferred flavors.

This packs a punch. Pretty well balanced. A good beer. Not my favorite from a FFF DIPA, though. Permanent funeral is a little more my style. This is a shade more bitter than I prefer.

It is a slightly hazy orange color with good clarity and vision of tiny bubbles coming up through the glass. Spotty lacing down the glass as the beer was drank.    Smell: Grapefruit, citrus, herbal, and stone fruit hops followed by caramel, biscuity, toasted, and nice boozy alcohol.    Taste: Nice citrus, herbal, and stone fruit hops flavor with caramel, toasted, doughy, and biscuity malts. Light tingly bitterness and warm alcohol in the rear.    Mouthfeel: Smooth, medium bodied, medium to high carbonation, a little chewy, crisp, light bitterness, and a little boozy.     Overall: Nice balanced DIPA without the harsh alcohol flavor. Enjoyable and super smooth. Got better as it warmed up like most other DIPA'S too.

A: Pours a hazy, dark, Amber-red color. One-inch, cream colored, foamy head with great retention. Thin cream colored lacing throughout.  S: Tropical and citrus notes of Mango, pineapple, peach, and grapefruit. With sweet and carmel malt undertones.  T: Getting lots of piney hop bitterness with some grapefruit notes mostly, accompanied by very mild fruity notes, which are all balanced well with sweet malt flavors.  F: Near medium bodied, smooth, good carbonation, with a slightly dry but crisp finish.  O: Overall, a great IIPA. Love the strong hop and grapefruit flavors. This was my first time having this one.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 L: light amber color with a nice 1-2inch head  S: very hoppy smells pine citrus with a nice malt character easily distinguished from the hops. I really enjoy this ones smell.   T: hoppy and bitter, citrus, grapefruit, lemon zest. Somewhat crackers and grasslike malt characteristic. Could drink this one all day. Great hop character but is well balanced by malt. Maybe it's because I had this nary a week after bottling. I know others say the malt doesn't balance the bitter but I have to disagree. Wonderful taste. Juicy and malty very good.   F: full mouthfeel nothing to special but nothing to complain about.   O: I've had this before when it was less fresh and it did not do the beer justice. I got lucky this time around having it recently bottled it was exceptional. I love this One and luckily I have a second :)

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a deep amber orange color with some slight haze. Has a nice, 2-finger off-white head that dissipates quickly but leaves a nice crown around the top of the beer.    The aroma is disappointingly subtle to me. I get some pine resin and grapefruit, and maybe a touch of malts. Very pleasant, just very muted.    The flavor is definitely an intense hop bomb. It's resiny and bitter, with pine and grapefruit notes up the wazoo. My only issue is I'm not getting a lot of balance here. It's just an assault of hops. That said, I enjoy being assaulted by hops. Could just use some malt sweetness to make it not so rough.    The feel is medium bodied with medium-heavy carbonation. Bitter as hell and the bitterness sticks around to let you know it isn't leaving because it can't afford alimony.    Overall, a very good DIPA. It's just lacking in balance, otherwise it would be great.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Bottled on 4/1/16. Poured into a teku glass.    Appearance: Rich caramel color with good clarity and a topping of frothy off-white foam.    Aroma: Dried fruits and actually a touch of alcohol.    Taste: Not what I was expecting at all but great in it's own right. The mulled fruit and deep caramel flavors in here are more reminiscent of a barleywine for me. While hoppy, there is a balance from the heavy malt and hot alcohol character. The bitterness reaches a peak during the finish but quickly ebbs away. Aftertaste is quite dry. Actually seems like much higher alcohol than 9.5% ABV.    Mouthfeel: Between medium and full in body with average carbonation for the style. Drinkability is decent but hindered by the very drying aftertaste.    Final Thoughts: Although I didn't detect any of the citrusy/tropical flavors others have described, it still had good flavor. It does a good balancing act of teetering between super drying ethanol bomb and well-rounded brew. It's really not normal. Would I drink it again? Sure.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Popped open a 22-oz bottle my parents brought back from 3F last month. Bottled on date of 4/1/16. Pours a dark yellow with some brown tint indicative of the caramel malt used. Smells almost equally of bready, almost chewy, malts with a resin like, piney, citrus hop character. Smells clean with no off flavors or hot alcohols. Leaves some nice lacing on the glass sides. Tastes malty sweet but is nicely balanced with ample bitterness and the hop character as described in the nose. Feels medium bodied. Clean & crisp with that bitter bite at the end. Some waning alcohols in the back of the throat.     Overall, a Very nicely balanced DIPA. Rare to see this much caramel these days. Sort of reminds me of Maharaja from Avery. Definitely glad to have tried as this is rated #144 out of the top 250 beers on the BA website.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours a dark, hazy, amber/orange. Great citrus aroma and flavor, with a HUGE malty after taste that actually kills the hop flavor. Too malty for my taste but still a great tasting Imperial. If you love malt bombs, you will love this.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 This poured a pretty dark cloudy amber orange. Malt and citrus in both smell and taste. For lack of a better word "malt bomb". Alcohol isn't that noticeable. Mouthfeel is slightly thick with medium carbonation. Overall, an okay DIPA. I was pretty underwhelmed and disappointed by this one. It tastes like a 9.5% Alpha King. The best thing it has for it is the relatively unnoticeable alcohol. It made for a pretty easy drinking beer, just not a very good one.

Some nice spicy peppery earthiness in a very dry finish. Medium silky soft mouthfeel. It had been awhile since I'd had this one, wow just as great as I remember, so balanced and delish.

Smell- strong malt presence up front, citrus, mango in background    Taste-despite malt smell dominance, this beer is not overtly sweet. Very balanced for an imperial IPA with backend bitterness that makes u want another sip immediately.    Mouthfeel- more dry than expected, medium bodied. Goes down nice    Overall- a beer I have coveted for a long time. Enjoyable experience

The liquid is a mildly hazy dark orange color which is full to the rims, minimal visible bubbles. The nose is stuffed with sweet citrus — tangerine, orange, pink grapefruit and then loads of cocoa, malted milk balls, toffee and scone, bitter tea leaf, tar, the pineapple, guava, nectarine fruit scents are think without becoming monotonous. In the mouth it’s full-bodied, heavy enough that the creaminess doesn’t smooth out the mouth feel. Spicy with peppercorn and pine notes, here that muscular grapefruit, tangerine citrus sweetness acts as a calming agent. The florality itself seems mostly citrus blossom. Some cocoa and sweet grains to breakfast breads type of appeal. Not very herbaceous nor grassy at all. The carbonation lends a consistent fine prickle. Ends with full flavor vibrancy and a gentle landing.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 So far, I've been lucky enough to score a few Three Floyds beers from traders, and been slightly-underwhelmed by two of them. This third one, if nothing else, is certainly the most interesting of the group, though I'm sad I let it get away from me and it's been sitting in the cellar maybe a month or so longer than it should have.   It pours with plenty of thick, foamy head and crystal clear amber coloring in the body.    If they're going for a tropical fruity, juicy IIPA, they nailed it on the nose...literally. It smells like pineapple juice, with some hints of apricot and mango. A bit of resinous hoppy smell off to the side, but fruit is the main contender here for attention.    The taste is something else entirely. Much drier and more resinous than the smell would have you believe. I get a bit of dry cider, substantial bitter hops, and a minimal malty backbone, but it smoothes out as the glass sits out a bit, losing bitterness and developing more interesting flavors. In short, this beer is not interested in balance. The texture is chewy and thick, the bitterness lingers, and the booze is strong but smooth.    I would definitely try this again fresh. I want to see if all those fruity hop aromas make it into the flavor on a fresh batch. Maybe someday...

Combonation of soapy and foamy head is so almost tan it is so off white. Decent lacing.     Aroma is very citrusy and piney. Sweeter fruits with some significant doughy malts and alcohol.     Lots of peach/apricot, mango, a touch of orange, and some bitter pine resin. Lip smacking. The bitterness continues to take over the flavors. A tad boozy. Dry finish. Carbonation is on the lower end, but the mouthfeel is excellentl. Very creamy for the appearance suggests.     A wonderful imperial, but not up there with APW for me.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 0,3L pour in a tulip on tap. Couldn't take notes at the time, so this one's from memory of an hour ago. Beautiful honey-orange color, with a hop-forward nose with hints of citrus and sugar. Palate is balanced - dry hops, some citrus, pine, and malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is substantial. Overall, this beer didn't blow me away. It has a lot of hype to live up to, so perhaps that's not ultimately surprising. This is, undeniably, an excellent DIPA, but among the best of the best? I'm not sure I'd go that far.

It's definitely hoppy, but the happiness is not dominating. Rather the citrus and other fruit flavors come through loud and clear. It's almost like a sweeter version of Pliny. Just an absolutely fantastic beer

The aroma is tropical and sweet candied fruit, mango and pineapple and orange and maybe some crazy Minute Maid concoction of exotic fruits.  So damn tasty. Big frui flavor that follow the nose followed by massive sweetness.   Mouthfeel is medium and almost sticky. Just fucking great. Wish I had another bottle.

A bit darker than I expected for an IPA that was under a month old.    S: The smell yield straight grapefruit at first with a bit of pine coming through in the background. 3 Floyds hops their beers so much that I can't really smell much of anything other than hops. What I do smell is very pleasant though.    T: The taste, per usual follows the nose pretty well. Huge grapefruit notes, which is indeed different from the new school IPAs that have been taking over the world lately. There is a hint of pine with some of the malt in the background. This is pretty damn good. I've had better, but what I'm having now is definitely great.    F: The fact that this is 9.5% is mindblowing. Not a tinge of alcohol to speak of. It is medium bodied, with a moderate level of carbonation. Overall definitely an easy beer to drink.    Overall: This is a really nice beer. 3 Floyds is obviously highly regarded in the world of beer and with beers like this I can definitely see why. The grapefruit notes are very strong and the pine plays well with the malt in the background. I've only have 2 beers from 3 Floyds (this and ZD) and both have been top notch. I can't wait to try more from 3F!

Smells of ripe red fruits, featuring apple, peach and blood orange, well accentuated by lime rind. Exhibits a resinous sweetness, blending outstandingly well into the beers dough malts. Hoppy fruitiness defines the nose most pleasantly, together with a toffee sweetness on top of it.    Has a lower carbonation, showcasing a powerful mixture of distinct hops and sweet, well pronounced malts, offering the palate up to an extreme, huge but focused IIPA.    Begins with a very soft, aqueous note, bringing riper fruits from the nose to the palate, effectively balanced by bready, slightly earthen malts, which then turn suddenly honey glazed sweet. The prominent malt backbone defines how the hops evolve on the palate from that point on, pointing out features of ripe red apples, mango, water melon pulp and lemon coated peach, still accentuated by a dry earthiness. During the finish, the beer looses its slick sweetness, in favor of a pungent, leafy lemon dryness, pumped up by a bubbly carbonation. Hoppiness reaches its peak at that stage, numbing the tongue for a short glance, returning its initial aqueous characteristic with a well pronounced, long lasting lemon dryness to it.    This is an extreme, and extremely well build, beer. While it inherits typical double ipa features of a resinous sweetness, its tropical hoppiness lurks underneath, waiting just for the right moment to take over the lead. Both ingredients not only blend flawlessly together, but feature an amazing clean, powerful flavor profile on their own.

Look = 4.5 Pours a clear golden orange color with 4 fingers of thick, frothy just off white head. Incredible retention and lace, like most of 3 floyd’s DIPAs.  Aroma = 4.5 Strong hop notes dominate. Citrus and tropical fruity notes, mild pine and orange rind with a thick sweet toffee and bready malt backbone.  Taste = 4.25 Tropical fruit flavors lead the way complimented with light citrus notes and a hint of pine. All lays on top of a sweet malt backbone of toffee and bready character. Really only a pretty minor bitterness in the finish.  Feel = 4.5 Full bodied with medium to high carbonation; some fizziness, syrupy and mild resin feel.  Drinkability = 4.0 It’s a big DIPA but the mild bitterness makes it pretty drinkable.  Overall = 4.3625 Another great DIPA from FFF, really solid in all categories.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Original was on tap at Gallo's Tap Room. Edit was from bomber dated October 5, 2015 enjoyed October 27, 2015 in a Hoof Hearted Teku.     Look - Thin head but weak pour in bar. Light apple juice look with clear around the edges. Thin lacing. Unique.    Edit - Head is darker. Very thick bubbles.    Smell - Pineapple. Orange. Grapefruit. Other citrus. Earth. Resin. Barley.    Taste - Bitter and malt complemented well by the citrus.    Edit - Tea. Vanilla.     Feel - Carbonation. Medium to heavy. Tongue does curl.    Edit - Medium to heavy.     Overall - I still want a bomber of it. Not what I was expecting. This borders on being a strong ale. Pick it up if you can.    Edit - The bomber is nice. Closer to triple IPA but that is hard to distinguish with a strong ale.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 I had this beer on tap at a Chicago bar and three days later had a bomber that I brought back to Florida. The beer that I had on tap was delicious. You can tell how fresh it was with a strong hoppy smell and taste with the perfect malt backbone. Tasted orange and other tropical fruit and it was highly drinkable going down very smoothly for a DIPA. The bottle was different. Gone were the strong hoppy smells and flavor but the beer was still good with a bubble gum sweetness rather than the orange and tropical flavors. The bottle version may not have been as fresh and I definitely favor draught. My ratings represent the draught beer. If I were to rate the bottle the ratings would be a half of point lower for taste and overall.

Dense lacing left on the sides of the glass. Smell isn't overwhelming, but I got pine, citrus, spice, grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. Light weight, and very creamy, fluffy mouthfeel. Very easy drinking for 9.5%. Pine and hops up front with notes of grapefruit and orange midways. Has a sweet, crisp finish with a tiny bit of malt noted. Piney/citrus aftertaste.     A very decent beer. Looks great in the glass, and is nice all around. It's very well balanced and hides the abv well (not boozy at all). To me, this is a traditional beer done correctly. While it's not my favorite IIPA, it's probably in my top 5.    For what it's worth, I have a cold coming on at the moment, but I wanted to drink this as fresh as possible. I'd like to revisit this one in the near future when my senses are at 100%.

Great brew still but not quite up there with some of the other truly world class ipa

Towering bone white head pours 2-3 fingers high with outstanding retention and lace.    S - Huge fresh orange note with edges of lemon.    T - Fantastic, juicy fresh-squeezed orange flavor with a supporting cast of of bitter wax, thyme and basil.     M - Medium-light body. Deliciously smooth.    O - A fruit-forward take on the style that is surprisingly light and refreshing.

A - Dark golden, pale orange color. Nice clarity and a pillow-like white head and strong lacing. Pours pretty thick for an IPA.    S - Strong orange, citrus notes mixed with a full barley tones accompanied by a nice caramel.     T - Upfront the great citrus, orange zest character is strong and then the malt and caramel washes over your palate. This beer has the biggest malt backbone you can find with 9.5% ABV and a strong hop bitterness making this a delicious beer. The finish is pretty crisp with the bitterness to match the rich maltiness. Though it isn't as rich as a barley wine or as hoppy as some DIPAs but there is great flavor.     M - High mouth-feel with higher carbonation. This beer is between a DIPA and a barley wine and is quite amazing on the palate with this combination.     Overall, an excellent take on a DIPA. The awesome orange zest flavor with the big maltiness is a great combination. I do mostly prefer the more hop flavor the better but this beer is a nice change of pace but still has tons to offer. I would strongly recommend trying a fresh one of theses and I look forward to getting another next time I visit the brewery.     Glass- Three Floyd's Pint

look: 2.75 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 1.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.25 Poured into a Dogfish Head IPA glass    I would like to make a note my beer was FRESH, only roughly 3 weeks on the bottling date.    A - 2.75 - Poured a foggy, murky, honey gold color. Formed a finger of quickly dissipating slightly off-white head. I did not see any pieces of sediment floating around or at the bottom of the glass, so, not sure what's up with the murky haziness.  S - 2.75 - A total malt bomb. Smells like an IPA that has sat for far too long. There are faint traces of peach, mango and hops in the background, but this is entirely overpowered by the intense, almost sickeningly sweet aroma of caramel and malt.   T - 1.75 - Just as bad if not worse than the aroma. This literally tasted as if you took an orange gummy candy, melted it down, mixed it with orange Triple Sec liquor, added in some caramel and called it a beer.   F - 3 - The mouthfeel for me was completely irrelevant because of the taste.  O - 2.25 - This beer absolutely did NOT do it for me. I have a HARD time believing the bottling date on this beer was accurate because it tasted OLD. If this is what the beer was actually intended to taste like, then I have no idea how its score is so high, nor how it made its way onto the BA top 250 list. Disappointing as hell.

Nose is just awesome with mainly citrus but some tropical fruit--no pine.    Although scored 100IBUs--really not the bitter bomb I was expecting. Malts really keeps the hops in check with predominantly citrus then lighter fruit notes and great mouthfeel.    Love it.

The resin just jumps out of the glass. Some citrus shines through after the initial hop blast.     Taste/Mouthfeel:The hops in this beer are crazy. They hammer your mouth, but it somehow finishes smooth with just slight bitterness. Excellent.     Overall: Great beer with an unbelievable smell.

look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3 My notes below are truncated; I'm having this beer as part of my annual Christmas tasting. Reviewed live at high altitude in Castle Rock, CO.    BOTTLE: Brown glass. Branded pry-off pressure cap. 1 pint 6 fl oz.    Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. Served cold into a Guinness goblet. Expectations are sky high; this is currently #123 on the top 250.    No bubble show forms as it's poured.    HEAD: 2 finger wide. White colour. Nice thickness, creaminess, and fullness. Good even consistency. Nice complexion.    BODY: Clear translucent copper. Vibrant and appealing. Clean; no yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible. Retention is above average - about 4 minutes. Light lacing sticks to the sides of the glass as it recedes.    AROMA: A well-balanced blend of citrus, subtle pine, juicy fruit, mango, passionfruit, pale malts, clean barley, and prominent peach. Seems impeccable, though it could be fresher, juicier, and even more appealing.    Aromatic intensity is mild.    The bursts of fruit are fantastic.    No yeast character, alcohol, or off-notes are detectable.    TASTE: Mango, peach, pale malts, floral hops, faint pine, vague citrus, and juicy fruit. The balance is what stands out. Good depth of flavour. Average intensity and duration of flavour. Complex enough, with adequate subtlety and nuance. But it's not unique or special, and doesn't stand out. I do quite like it. But the rindy hop bitterness gets through the pale malt sweetness far more than it should, turning me off to the brew. And I'd prefer it didn't venture into tropical hop territory to the extent that it does.    Clean, with no off-notes, yeast character, or alcohol detectable.    TEXTURE: Subtly dry but wet enough to refresh, smooth, medium-bodied, well-carbonated, juicy, refreshing, and aptly thick. Complements the taste quite well, but doesn't quite elevate the beer. Presence on the palate is nice, but could be better.     Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, rough, or scratchy.    OVERALL: Quite drinkable. I do like it, but the hop profile isn't ideal for my tastes. I'd like more of an oily resinous build with less peach. I've certainly had better, but it's a lovely offering in the style. I'd certainly pick it up again if I saw it on-shelves. Not a world class offering by any means, and certainly not the 123rd best beer out there, but enjoyable and worth trying.    High C+    ***  10.12.15: 2nd impressions from a bottle in Indiana below. This is now #106 in the top 250.    BOTTLE: 650ml. Flashy loud label art. Purchased at 3 Floyds two days ago. Bottled 10-05-2015.    Reviewed live as an imperial IPA per the label.    APPEARANCE: Head is about 3-4 inches wide, with an off-white colour. Average characteristics. Fluffy. Recedes within 3 minutes. Body is a copper of average vibrance. Has a generic look for its style.    AROMA: Way too much caramalt/caramel sweetness. Hop profile is sticky and oily, with notes of new world tropical fruits like mango, as well as rindy bitterness. That said, none of the muted hop notes are vivid or expressive. This suggests a shallow beer which lacks intricacy and subtlety.    TASTE & TEXTURE: Heavy on the palate, with a filling coating syrupy feel that covers its booziness but is somewhat off-putting especially combined with the overly malty saccharine build. I taste more malts than hops - and this bottle is a week old. Lacks any vivid, deep, or expressive hop notes whatsoever, opting instead for surface level mango, melon rind, and shallow floral notes. In spite of the syrupy caramalt and pale malt backbone, some imbalanced hop bitterness is still present in the third act, scratching and attacking the palate to ill effect.    Poorly constructed, though it does boast decent cohesion. I like this even less than the first time I had it. Neither gestalt nor intricate.    OVERALL: Its goopy syrupy feel and overmalted build make it a beer I find tough to enjoy. The hop profile is lackluster and drinkability is low. I remain confused about this beer's popularity, but maybe it's just personal taste. In any case, I won't be buying it again.    Low C-

Aroma: Strong/intense citra aroma that makes you want to just smell the beer forever, rather than drink it.    Taste: Big malt flavor with well ballanced bitterness and a crisp finish.    Aftertaste: Citrus aftertased with a mild earthy note.    Mouth feel: Very smooth.    Overall: Excellent Imperial IPA.
