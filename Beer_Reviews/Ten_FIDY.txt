look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Very nice, smooth, rich imperial stout that had a good balance between mild bitterness and malt sweetness. Pours a deep, dark, rich black color with some darker tan-copper head and some sheets of lingering lacing that stayed for about 10-15 minutes. Smells of dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, roasted nuttiness, stone fruit, malt, caramel and vanilla. Taste follows the nose, along with some brown sugar, raisin and some faint toffee. Smooth, rich, slightly sticky mouthfeel that mildly coated the palate. Good carbonation. An excellent beer and I’m looking forward to trying their barrel-aged version.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 12oz canned 8/22/18 (5 months ago) poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at fridge temp 10.5% ABV. The beer pours dense black with reddish mocha colored head. The head recedes to a quarter inch cap and the lacing is complete and spectacular. The aroma is earthy chocolate and roast malt. The taste is semisweet roasty, ashy, bitter chocolate with hints of caramel. The mouthfeel is full bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a semi dry finish. Overall, outstanding. The feel is the star here with taste and appearance coming closely behind. Velvety texture and a fantastic balance of sweet and bitter.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Finally rating my fave RIS. Better than Expedition by a slight margin, the flavors are more complex and meld together with ease. They do well to limit the molasses from overwhelming the beer while letting the subtle flavors of vanilla, chocolate, dark fruit, and hints of coffee to come to the forefront. Just perfectly balanced, zero booze, one of my favorite beers of all time.

Very good looking stout.   S - Dark chocolate and roasted malts - it's a good smell, but a little faint.   T - Loads of bitter dark chocolate followed quickly by roasted, toasted malts, hints of toffee, vanilla, and caramel   F - Full bodied with a light to moderate amount of carbonation - creamy, smooth, thick.   O - A great imperial stout with a flavor profile that hits all the right notes, and hits them well. Nothing fancy, just a good old fashioned imperial stout - a breath of fresh air in a sea of bourbon barrel aged stouts and dessert stouts. Well done Oskar Blues.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Date: Canned on 08/22/18, enjoyed on 12/10/18.    Appearance: Pours out completely black, creating a finger and a half of tan head. The lacing on the glass as I swirl is something to see.    Aroma: Dark well roasted, near charred malts, loads of green hops, roasted coffee, higher cacao percent dark chocolate, molasses, graham cracker, oak, raisin, and a little vanilla.    Taste: Vanilla, dark chocolate, and a good amount of dark fruit juice hits first, followed by malts that taste more charred than they smelled. The end is a mix of thick and rich mouth coating molasses and a lingering oak bitterness. This is somewhat reminiscent of Deschutes The Abyss in its mixture of dark fruit and oak flavors. The hops work very well here to balance out the sweet qualties much as they do in North Coast's Old Rasputin. The mouthfeel is full and coats the palate, also there is some heat here but it isn't anythin that detracts. The beer gods be praised, for we have here a highly rated malt driven near masterpiece that isn't a damn pastry stout! While I don't think it's as good as Old Rasputin of Expedition Stout, it is a great beer for those snowy afternoons when you arrive at the realization that its bone chillingly cold and there is another three months of winter to slog through.

Overall a really nice thick Russian imperial stout. Teeters right on the edge of too much bitterness but ends up on the balanced side, good stuff.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 This beer features one of the darkest, fullest heads Ican ever remember seeing on a beer, even a stout. Notes of fig, coffee, chocolate and black cherry accompany that monster head and jet body.     There s so much going on here it is a little overwhelmng. You have your dak ruits, roasted coffee and bakerschocolate colliding with 98 IBUs of piney hoptasticness. A bit of oatmeal smooths out that mouthfeel just right. Its quite amazing that this lives up to its outsized reputation. The ultimate deep winter stout?

The aroma is roasted malt, smoked malt, soy sauce, and dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is full bodied, well carbonated, and very creamy. The flavour is roasted malt, dark chocolate, and peppery spice. Maybe even a hint of coffee. The beer came with quite a reputation and it lives up to it. An excellent beer.

Smells of roasted, caramel malt, dark chocolate and licorice with a hint of dark fruit, coffee and vanilla. A certain hoppy note there as well. Taste follows the nose exactly, with a complex balance being dominated by roasted, caramel malt, dark chocolate, licorice and dark fruit: fig, plum, and just a hint of coffee, vanilla and a certain hoppy, almost piny, note. Finishes with a medium, dry bitterness. Smooth, almost oily mouthfeel with a medium body and low carbonation. Quite complex and well-balanced stout, very impressive.

Chocolate, dark rum, burnt caramel on the nose.   Tastes like a pure dark chocolate bar with roasted coffee nibs in it. A pleasant building heat in the finish, very dry, and some lingering espresso bitterness. The notes of rum remain as well, and cassis. The best part - sweetness is subdued, acting as a touch of balance. This feels like the definition of roasted malts. Light carbonation and medium-heavy body, with a creaminess like a chocolate bar was actually melted in it.     This is intense, but unlike the other high ABV stouts I've had recently, not overwhelming in any way. The balance of flavours is spot on. And most importantly, not doused with sugar. The roasted malt flavours are left to shine, and they'll warm your soul.

look: 3 | smell: 1.5 | taste: 1.25 | feel: 1.25 | overall: 1.5 I used to love this beer, what happened to it? The past 2 years I’ve bought it has been a disappointment! I remember the first time I tried it about 4 years ago it was amazing and became my favorite dark brew. It used to be so smooth and that deep double fudge cookie flavor was there. Lately it just taste metallic and awfully bitter, skunky maybe? Did they change brew masters? I live in Austin TX where Oskar Blues opened a location, could it be they’re brewing it here under a different brew master? If so it explains the drastic change in quality, I hope someone can provide me an update on this. Bring back the original recipe please! $16 for 4 cans is expensive and a damn waste for below mediocre quality.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Holy shit, this is amazing. I’m trying this on Christmas Eve after the dinner and a couple of Cruiser All Day Pale Ales and this is a great way to finish the evening.    I’ve got a hell of a cold but I can still get the aroma here: dark chocolate, dried figs and a hint of liquorice but the liquorice really comes through in the after taste once you’ve taken a gulp.    This is an amazing beer to drink at Christmas time. Definitely one to be savoured.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Aged 1 year, drunk room temperature into a snifter:    Dark as oil with a 3 inch rootbeer float head that diminishes completely half way through. Smells chocolatey with matching flavors of super dank chocolate as well as coffee, no alcohol taste for 10.5% abv beer, super smooth and silky. Dangerously drinkable, super crushable. Best RIS beer that isn't barrel aged. I can only imagine what the barrel aged would be like. Wow what a beast of a beer.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 I am relatively new to Russian Imperial Stouts, but am aware of this beer being one to try if you want a good one that's not barrel aged and "adjuncted." Super dark black both in the glass and on the pour. Aggressive pour of the last two or so ounces produced a big three finger dark roast colored head. I let this set out 20 minutes before drinking, and really didn't get a lot on the nose besides faint roast/char, coffee, and dark chocolate (the usual suspects with stouts). Taste follows the nose for sure. With the roast/char balancing well with the dark chocolate. Bitter to dry finish. The mouth feel is my favorite part of this beer. So silky and full, with just the right amount of carbonation. Almost like whole milk.

Lots of roasted barley as well.     In the taste the first appearance is fresh roasted coffee. As the beer warms more of the chocolatey and caramel flavors come forth.     A beautifuly, enjoyable brew.     One that I would recommend. I will purchase again.

A smell of chocolatey malt rises up but the roasted smell seems to clash with hops, smothering out their stench. The taste greatly personifies this, covering up the bite with an obviously dominate malt character. Still, this one seems to put the "imperial" in imperial stout. A nice, heavy drinker with a medium-heavy, residual, almost sticky/oily feel on the back of the tongue and the throat. The head settles in a few minutes time, leaving but a little carbonation. Overall a great beer by a great company.

The smell is divine. I'm enjoying this on tap, but the price for a 4 pack of 12 oz cans has driven me away. Even though it's enjoyable on tap i won't pay the canned price.    Edit: having a draft of a 2014 barrel. There's a lot more raisin flavor, the beer is smoother. Any off flavor is eliminated. Totally worth the wait for this bar owner. It made me raise my rating on this beer.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 A: solid, midnight black color. No light shining through at all. Real nice dark tan .5 finger head     S: Deep dark chocolate, roast malt, milk chocolate , some soy sauce. There is some lactose sweetness in the aroma as well    T: silky milk chocolate, roasted malts, caramel, toffee, dates, soy sauce, cola, brown sugar. There is a touch of bitterness from the roast malt, which is good because it balances out some of the sweetness. Also, some bitterness from the roast malt. Very luscious taste    M: heavy, super silky mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Definitely a sipper    O: fantastic stout. It’s heavy, rich, and silky smooth. Sip on this and enjoy!

Smells dark, roasty, getting more dark fruit than coffee and chocolate.  Taste follows, a touch on the bitter side with the dark fruit, burnt malt, some dark coffee notes as well. Pretty dry finish.  Feel is thick, a bit chewy with a good carbonation level.  Overall a very tasty stout, enjoying this one and looking forward to the BA version.

Smell: A lot of liquor, with roasted chocolate following the alcohol.  Taste: A lot of liquor and a nice coffee finish to it.  Feeling: If you can understand the theme of things... A lot of liquor with a nice kick to it.  Overall: This is a good beer with I believe to be just too much of an alcohol percent to enjoy the other attributes to this beer.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Petroleum color that verted like motor oil with a huge and thick dark caramel head with great retention and leaving good laces.  Nice aroma with notes of cocoa, vanilla, dark chocolate, a bit of smoke, licorice, pine, some roasted coffee beans and plums.  Flavor with notes of cocoa, spices, pine, grapefruit citrusy, lactic acid, oats, licorice, figs, raisins, molasses, drops of bourbon, Port Wine and prunes. Dry and bitter aftertaste. Its 65 IBUs are enough to balance its robust body.  Full oily body with appropriate carbonation. Alcohol of 10.5% abv is superbly well hidden.  Excellent Imperial Stout with great complexity and perfect execution. More chocolatey than coffee and once it warmed up revealed lots of dark fruit notes as well. Despite its 65 IBUs it is not very hoppy, though this exemplar has been cellared for several months. Definitely a sipper. Worth trying and revisiting given its great cost benefit ratio.

The taste is good but a little hindered by the ABV, wishing the coffee was stronger and other notes more pronounced. I am getting a burnt oat/malt, lots of alcohol, bourbon and smokey notes. the finish is lingering burnt taste with mild alcohol. Overall a medium to heavy beer, I think some more coffee up front and blending could make this better but compared to others in the class I am sort of bummed.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Canned 18 days ago so this stuff is fresher than ideal, but I'll take it    L — 1,000 lumens passed through the glass reveals an incredibly dark black body. It is so dark, in fact, that there aren’t even the faintest traces of light coming through the edges of the glass. Definitely up there with Speedway Stout and KBS for darkest beer I’ve had. 3-finger light brown head produced with moderately aerated pour. Amazing retention and lacing   S — Pleasantly warming spiced chocolate, barley malts, molasses, bourbon, candied dark fruits, fruity yeast esters, hazelnut, and toffee   T — Starts with a molasses sweetness, immediately followed by an explosion of charred barley malt, french roast coffee, bittersweet chocolate, bourbon, and burnt sugar. A real smack-you-in-the-face kind of beer   F — This one plays tricks on you. At first it seems to be oily and slick, with minimal carbonation and practically no velvety or silky qualities. But after each sip there is a sudden sensation of fine pulpiness across the palate, at which point the flavors become most apparent. Long, sticky finish. Huge mouthfeel   O — Damn this stuff is awesome, especially in a can!? It’s widely available but only for a limited time each year, so if you see it, buy a 6er! And then have 1 can every 2 months throughout the year     87/100

Heavy creamy body and medium-light carbonation. Overall this is easily one of the best widely available and affordable stouts I’ve ever had. Actually you know what, it is the best affordable imperial stout.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a single-serve CAN into a stout glass.    Pours---absolutely motor-oil black. Thick, viscous, and everything a stout should be. The head is perhaps the darkest tan with mottled dark brown I've ever seen, and it's sticky, foamy, and has excellent staying power considering the ABV. The foamy lacing endures throughout the drink. I don't give "5" ratings on any point lightly--this is a winner.    The aroma is a full-on assault of complexity and power. Malts very forward, manifesting mostly in dark fruit, as opposed to coffee and chocolate, though they are present as well. Smoke and burnt sugar join the party, with the hops dancing in the background. Just a hint of booze completes it.    The flavor follows the look and the nose. Dark fruits (black cherry, fig and raisin), burnt sugars, blackstrap, smoke, and espresso coffee with hops arriving at the finish to balance the party. Perhaps a bit heavy-handed on the bitter notes, but that's more a matter of personal preference than criticism.    The mouthfeel is outstanding. Thick, chewy and heavy, yet the strong carbonation and hops provide a crisp finish.    This is a top-notch RIS. A must try.

A one and a half inch thick puck of medium brown dense foam settles over a thick black body that pours a dark oily brown. Heavy lacing and alcohol legs slide down the glass with each tilt.    The nose isn't as robust as I would have liked but the cocoa, roasted malt, dark fruit and slight hop aromas are nice. Tastes of coffee, sweet raisin and prune and a hint of sticky sweet chewing tobacco. It is mostly malty but the hop bitterness is there. The finish is fairly quick with some heat and a semi-sweet tang. While I mentioned sweet several times it isn't overly sweet and is definitely flavored like a RIS. The carbonation is low adding to the creamy smoothness of the full body.    A good RIS, one that I will certainly revisit this winter.

Look: The beer pours out like oil – gorgeous, I'm salivating just looking at it. An opaque black with 4cm of dense, dark brown head that settles into a cap after 4-ish minutes. Very impressive head for such a strong beer. Great lacing too!    Smell: Strong and surprisingly well-balanced aroma for an imperial stout. Rich and complex with notes of roasted malts, dark chocolate, tobacco, licorice, molasses, caramel, and some dark fruit. Holy smokes there's a lot going on in the nose.    Taste: Bam! Strong and balances towards bitter. Same tasting notes as the aroma. Damn special and a treat to drink. The finish is long, strong, and bitter.    Feel: Full body with moderate carbonation. Deliciously thick, slick, and chewy with restrained alcohol warmth. Faint astringency. Mind-blowing presence on the palate.    Overall: Big, behemoth of a beer. I love the style and this is among my absolutely favourites. World class and a must try.

Two fingers of firm long lasting mocha head. Dense sticky lacing that coats the entire inside of the glass half way through. Some legs on this one. The smell is of deep dark chocolate malts with big expresso coffee. Dark fruits. Molasses. Rich fudge. Tart alcohol.    Wow!!! A massive assault on the tongue with an all in one punch of dark chocolate malts, heavy creamy cocoa, some smokey chocolate. Add lush creamy coffee and dark fruits along with faint molasses. Boozy yet still chewy and silky on the palate. Just a hint of bitter hops remain. It definitely follows the nose with its full bodied and just right carbonation.    This is a huge stout meant to be enjoyed in sips rather that gulps. In my opinion one of the finest imperials in the world. Would have given fives all around but nothing is perfect. Enjoy! Cheers!!

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 It poured jet black yielding the same color body and left a brown one and a half inch foamy head. It settled down to a half inch after about a minute leaving some awesome lacing coating the sides of the pint glass. Some of the lacing formed rings after several sips. The smell was extremely boozy yet lets a bit of malt and chocolate come out as the beer warmed. The taste was sweet with the alcohol coming out very strong in the taste. The palate is about a medium to heavy, probably due to the ABV in this beast. There is nothing harsh on the tongue. Drinkable, no way, one and done due to the booziness. Overall, pretty good RIS that I come back to every now and again, preferably in the Winter.

Probably one of the best trades I've ever made.    Look - Pours a beautiful deep molasses brown, Heavy head with dark brown edging that sticks to the beer beautifully and doesn't fade.    Smell - Malt leads the pack. Nice chocolate and coffee notes. Burnt sugar and caramel as well. Alcohol blows a lot of this back but if you give it a second it really opens up.    Taste- Phenomenal. Well balanced malt followed by strong chocolate notes, molasses and burnt sugar on the palate as well. I would love to taste this beer after it has sat in a barrel.    Feel - Full bodied with small bubbles Just effervescent enough to calm the beer down but beautiful none the less.    Overall - Amazing

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 A classic velvety thick and pleasantly sweet imperial stout that's certainly improved by barrel aging, but it's pretty darn good in its own right as an easily-attainable (if, albeit slightly overpriced) non-BA shelfy stout in a can. In fact, I can't think of any better.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 This is one of my favorite beers. The feel is very smooth with the amount of alcohol that is in it. Taste of chocolate and coffee that is blended together exceptionally.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Exquisite. I'm used to calling Old Rasputin my favorite beer, but this baby might have just stolen the throne. The pour is thick, almost like mud, producing a dark brown, frothy head. Upon first ingestion, the beer coats your tongue and refuses to relinquish its hold on your taste buds. Oskar Blues has knocked it out of the park!   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pours black with a dark toffee colored head. The smell of alcohol is predominate. It has a dark rich strong coffee flavor with some sweetness. It's smooth and creamy with an easy swallow. At 10.5% this is a great stout.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 3.75 Living in the UK, this is a beer I sought out when visiting the US. Couldn't get it for a while, but was finally successful last year. I've had a few over the time, and here's my thoughts. Pours like death itself. Motor oil with a thick luscious head that has staying power and coats the glass. Nose is a bit milder than expected with rounded coffee, black licorice, and burnt sugars. Taste hit initially like it will be smooth and a touch sweet with lots of coffee and cocoa. Sadly, it quickly turns astringent and acrid. I wanted to love this beer, but the flavor just isn't that great. Mouthfeel is exceptional. Overall, what this beer does well is does magnificently, but the taste doesn't hold up.

Many RIP are super boozy and remain boozy from start to finish. This one is amazingly well balanced. Big fan !!

Smell - Loads of roasted malt, ashy, burnt coffee, sweet fruity alcohol.    Taste - Like the aroma only stronger. Gigantic roasted malt body, bittersweet dark chocolate, alcohol is noticeable but this is such a big beer that it fits right in, bitterness towards the end but no hop flavors I can pick up, aftertaste lasts into oblivion with burnt brownie edges and charred malts.    Feel - Full bodied, chewy, very slick and oily on the palate, good amount of alcohol warmth.    Overall - This is a huge beer. Not very complex, but it will cure a stout craving in no time. Powerful.

Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass.    Appearance: It was black in colour with a nice two fingered mocha brown head that had great retention and left lots of nice sticky lacing.    Aroma: Roasty coffee, rich dark chocolate and light char with hints of molasses and licorice.    Taste: Roasted malts, molasses and dark fruit plum and raisins to start, followed by rich dark chocolate, roasty coffee, caramel and a light char. Finish is lightly bitter.    Mouthfeel: Rich, velvety, creamy and smooth. Full bodied with moderate to light carbonation.    Overall: A wonderful Imperial Stout from Oskar Blues which is nicely balanced and great to drink.

Smells chocolate, caramel and coffee, grapefruits.    Taste is incredible. Oskar Blues knows the deal. Flavor of chocolate, coffee and very well balaced. You basically wont even feel the alcohol despite the strong ABV.    Overall, truly a masterpiece. Once again from OB which is and for a long time will be a top notch brewery.

Taste follows with a noticeable alcohol presence, and the sweet caramel covered dark chocolate it easily dominated by the roasty qualities. Fell in a bit harsh for me... A little intense on the carbonation and alcohol warmth. Overall, this is an outstanding imperial stout, but not my go to. Cheers!

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Appearance - poured into a tulip, this is the stuff heaven is made of. It pours the deepest of blacks with no visible carbonation! The head is an extremely fluffy 3 plus fingers of milk chocolate brown. This is exactly what an imperial stout should look like.     Aroma - both milk and dark chocolate are present in the nose along with sweet caramel, on the back end I get rich coffee beans.    Taste - its pretty boozy up front but still remains really smooth. The coffees bitterness is also prevailent but in a really good way there is a caramel sweetness behind it and as well as a rich dark chocolate.     Feel - this beer is on the heavier side of medium bodied with very little carbonation feel at all. There is a boozyness on the back end and a slight burn from the booze but nothing intolorable.    Overall - This is exactly what an imperial stout should be. Its strong yet smooth the flavors are rich and bitter but not overwhelming. I just wish it was slightly cheaper and more widely available north of the border! Cheers

Looks nice. Aroma of slightly sweet dark toasted malt, milk and dark chocolate, coffee and hint of booziness. Flavor is semi-sweet dark toasted malt with moderate char, dark chocolate, latte coffee, molasses; finishes with deep chocolate malt and modest hop bitterness. Excellent creamy body and mouth feel. One of the classic American stouts, rich and malty as would be expected from the Russian imperial stout style. The chocolate flavors are realistic and flavorful and the coffee is amazingly close to a stout with actual added brewed coffee. A triumph, and one that is relatively easy to find. I've drunk this for years as one of my top 5 stouts and can't believe I haven't reviewed it here. From my experience, this one ages well and gracefully.

Otherworldly lacing and excellent retention. This one is a real beaut.    S: licorice; salt; dried malt; mild roastiness and some faint hops.     T: just had a barrel aged, so this tastes mild by comparison, but tastes right for an RIS. Lightly sweet and fully malty arrival. Some roast bitterness on that Initial arrival, too. A little sweetness on mid palate, but it is subdued; more direct dark roasted malt. Toward the finish I pick up the licorice I got on the nose, then a really pleasant and full bitterness. Very hoppy ending, I like. Roast lingers. Some warming alcohol, but noticeably less than many RIS's, some with lower ABV.    M: full bodied and slick; less carbonation than others I've had recently; on the lower end of the spectrum for the style.    O: it is what it is cracked up to be- standard bearer for the style. Right up there with old Rasputin. Not braking boundaries, but taking what is now an established style and killing it. A sipper, for sure.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 12 oz can purchased at the LCBO; canned 10/05/2017 and served just below cellar temperature.     Pours as black as a moonless, clear night sky, crowned with just over a finger's worth of foamy, brown-coloured head. It melts away at a near-infinitesimal pace, resulting in a dense, creamy cap about a quarter-inch high, as well as a full coat of gorgeous lacing. On the nose, I'm getting lots of blackstrap molasses and caramelized sugar, in addition to roasted malt notes of rich chocolate, tobacco, espresso and charred wood. Hints of herbal hops, licorice root, vanilla and alcohol, with suggestions of prune and oatmeal.    Now THIS is an imperial stout - it doesn't hold anything back; subtlety is beneath this beer. Molasses, prune/plum and roasted malt flavours come through at first, with decadent dark chocolate and espresso notes. Aggressively bitter on the back end, with herbal, leafy, somewhat earthy hops, together with hints of licorice, burnt grain, vanilla and coffee grounds. Flavourful, bittersweet finish; the potent ethanol content warms the palate and esophagus, and also has a numbing effect on the tongue, while still managing to integrate with the roasted malts beautifully. Luxuriously full-bodied, with soft carbonation and a thick, viscous, silky-smooth texture that makes this imperial stout far more drinkable than it has any right to be.     Final Grade: 4.57, a rare A+. Ten FIDY has been the subject of rave reviews for more than a decade, receiving accolades that go back to when I was but a fledgling BA. I never dreamed I'd see it in Ontario, but *hot damn* am I glad that I've finally had a chance to try this utterly fantastic Russian imperial stout. While well-established, highly lauded beer labels like this one don't always live up to the hype, this is one case where the hype is totally justified - I would be hard-pressed to come up with suggestions for improvement, because it's basically perfect as-is. An absolute must-try for anyone who has ever enjoyed a strong stout.     Printed on the base of the can: "Space is really dark, man..." You think it's dark now? Just wait 10^40 years, when the universe is knocking on heat death's door and only black holes remain. Yes, I just brought up theoretical cosmology on BA. Cheers!

Canning date seems to be sometime in the fall of 2016.    Appearance - Absolutely jet black with a massive two finger brown head on top. Huge retention time and loads of frothy lacing clings to the glass. Imposing, serious, etc. a grown ass man's beer.     Smell - Coffee, mocha, leafy hops. Imperial stout all the way. Hints of tobacco and molasses for added effect.    Taste - Huge swell of molasses initially, followed by lots of bitterness, coffee, and traces of vanilla. Plenty of licorice too. An absolute malt bomb. Wow.    Mouthfeel - Super smooth, super slick, super dense. Chewy. What else could you want?    Overall - Simply put, one of the best RIS's out there on the market. Hefty price tag, but for this beer advocate who purchased 4, another 4 is certainly in the offing, Wonderful, big complex stout that warrants a try under any circumstances, especially the dead of winter.    Edit - January 1, 2018. Revisited this bad boy again as I stumbled upon a few cans at a local LCBO. Canned October 23, 2017. Was reminded why this is one of the best beers on the planet. Nose was more tropical, and taste had more molasses than I remembered, even though it was described. Damn this is good beer. A hell of a way to kick off the new year!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Thick brown color with a tall, tan head and a lot of lacing. Aromas of licorice, chocolate, and fruit. Taste: roasted, almost burnt malts, bitter chocolate, molasses, coffee, tobacco, and dried fruit. Great astringent-sweet interplay. Creamy mouthfeel with a dry finish and an aftertaste of pure alcohol. Probably the most I have ever paid for beer in a can, but damn worth it. (poured from a can dated 9/2016 with "Grandpa's Cough Syrup" written under it??)

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 This is a 2014 vintage, so a bit aged.     Look: Ten Fidy comes out a dark dark brown, near black, with a one inch brown/khaki head that dissipates quickly. Carbonation bubbles are ample.    Smell: Dark fruits are the first whiff I get, with some anise and leather showing through with swirl.     Taste: Anise hits quick, but subsides, followed by dark fruit, brown sugar, and some of that leather like flavor.     Feel: Medium full to full bodied, well carbonated, and somewhat drying but not terribly bitter. Somewhat hot.     Overall: I didn't really have expectations for Ten Fidy, but I'm happy with the beer. The aroma leans a bit more leather esque than I prefer, but the dark fruits and sweetness, complimented by a thicker body, make for a good beer. Worth a four pack yearly.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Serving: Can  Canned: Oct-15-2016 (Consumed Jan-7)      A:  Pours pitch black with 2 fingers of rusty brown head that gassily settles to a ring. Some lacing.  (3.75)    S:  Rich, smooth roast sweetness, oak, tobacco, charred grain, candied nut oiliness. (4.25)    T:  Coffee, roast char, slight astringency, smooth layered toasty sweet cocoa/brown sugar-ish layers. (4.25)    M:  Creamy, thick, substantive, rich and smooth, vaguely boozy with soft velvety finish from carbonation/alcohol/char. (4.5)    O:  Amazing stout.  I can't believe I've never rated this one. A true classic and one of the first imperial stouts I ever loved. Looks fairly nice in the glass. Rich all around with the taste being a little oaky and astringent and chocolatey. And the aroma sweeter. Somehow able to be huge and measured at the same time, giant flavor but no shuddering/palate fatigue/being punched in the face by flavors/etc. And in a can (that is also a nice 12oz serving size for wusses like myself. A true classic of the style. (4.5)

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Poured from from a 12oz can into a Speiglau Stout glass.     Pitch black, looks thick, with a thin cafe au lait head.     Aroma is roasted sweet molasses. Absolutely intoxicating.     Taste is thick and sweet with a slow sweetness at the end.     Incredible beer.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Pours a jet black from the can and leaves a monstrous head that says go away until I settle down.  Aroma is roasted, if not burnt to a crisp malt.  Flavors is burnt malts, old coffee and bitter chocolate.  This stuff goes down like motor oil. My dog once knocked over a glass in my driveway, the stain is still there 3 years later, and sealcoating hasn't hidden it.  Overall, if this isn't the best beer I've had then maybe its Founders Imperial Stout. It doesn't get much better than this.

From a handsomely dark beer with dark tan head and great lacing to it's roasty and boozy smell - it was very impressive. What surprised me was its less-than-stellar mouthfeel and less-than-very-good taste - I was expecting much more given the hype that surrounds this brew. Overall, it is a very good beer, no doubt, it's just that outside the boozy flavor it was mostly more bitter than I prefer from my stouts.

Smell is of dark fruits, coffee,roasted malts and possibly some bakers chocolate    Taste includes dark fruits, roasted coffee and malts, with a vodka like booze taste. I did however get a metallic taste which was probably contributed by the aluminum can    Overall this beer was fantastic! Silly, smooth, and wayyy to drinkable!

Roasted chocolate smell is great and the wonderful aftertaste will keep you coming back for more. At 10.5% this beer will sneak up on you and kick your ass.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Procured in a four pack of cans from Whole Foods; poured into a chalice:    L: Thick, dark black body, with multicolored mocha/tan head of about 1.5 fingers. Super fine bubbles that last incredibly well. You can't really see it disappearing, so the head looks like icing on a dark chocolate cake. Not sure if it's just the shape of my glass, but the head definitely leaves pentagon shaped lacing in layers.    S: Roast hits first with mocha and dark chocolate, balanced by vanilla, with a strong espresso finish.    T: Rich roasty dark chocolate dominates with smooth and creamy vanilla and coconut milk to balance. Dark fruit notes of plum and pomegranate, follow with a strong alcohol bite (like someone added a splash of vodka) finishing with coffee, dessert bread spices (cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, etc.) and charred oak. A clean, smart and perfect stout profile.    F: Full, creamy and a little bit dry, but thick and frothy. Goes down like whole milk.    O: Russian Imperial Stouts are my favorite style of brew, so I think I have a solid opinion on when it's been done right. Kudos to Oskar Blues and their exemplary malts.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 12oz can. 9/14/16 can date. Appearance: Jet black, opaque, with a low lying brown head and nice lacing for an imperial stout. Aroma: Deep rich chocolate with a touch of roast and cardboard. A nice layer of dark fruit with a touch of cherry. Taste: Rich and soft dark chocolate dominates with a light touch of roast, dark fruit, and a moderate perceived bitterness. Unbelievably balanced and soft transition between flavors. No harsh edges. Mouthfeel: Velvety, creamy, heavy bodied, with a low carbonation. Finish: Leaves a silky, rich chocolate and light roast maltiness. Overall: A world class imperial stout that is unbelievably smooth at all edges. Has that rich dark chocolate, dark fruit, and roast, with enough bitterness to balance it all. This has a velvety, silky smoothness and body that most imperial stouts can’t deliver.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 On tap, pours a deep black with a dense dark-chocolate head. Smell and taste are coffee, chocolate, a bit of dark fruit.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 One of the best IS's I've ever had. There are far more than enough reviews of this beer that represent the overall style. Well done, as *nearly* always, Oskar Blues.     Expensive at $14.99/4 can in a very tax free inexpesive state. HOWEVER, I drank four of these over 10 hours - and have rarely been as impressed - perhaps Founders, and so on...there are 3-4 other fine and readily-available Imperials, but this batch (11/16) was quite impressive.

A four pack for 12.99, little pricy for me but what the hell.     This beer pours like asphalt, pitch black and extremely thick. It left a dark tan head that looked quite nice. In a glass, this is one of the best looking stouts I've seen, just a perfect example of how a good stout should look and pour. I'm smelling a slight licoricey caramel scent, and a little bit of coffee as expected, dark roast. Yum.. Taste is exceptional, all of the smell with a tiny bit of booze, very well hidden though for a 10.5%. The mouthfeel is glorious... It's thick, it's creamy, it's dark, and it's like velvet. Extreme lacing happening with this brew as well. I'm enjoying my first glass thoroughly. I so wish I had this in my state, it would be a regular beer even with it's high price tag. Magnificent stuff here.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This beer will warm you up when it's cold outside, that's for sure. At 10.5% abv, it certainly doesn't taste that way. The look is thick and black. A brown head lingers for quite some time after the pour. The aroma is heavy, with roasted malts, caramel, and the slightest touch of booze. The taste is to die for. Thick, mouth-coating, and rich. Dark chocolate, caramel, and deep roasted coffee dominate. There is barely any alcohol taste coming through here. Extremely fucking dangerous situation for being 10.5%. The finish is sticky yet slightly dry, making me want to take drink after drink. Overall, this is incredible. Living in Colorado I was able to get a 4 pack for $13.99. If you see this, pick it up and enjoy.

Brown frothy 3/4 finger head,dissipates quickly,but maintains a beautiful lacing.Dark black body,with zero light showing through the glass.The body is so dark,it is hard to tell how much carbonation there really is.    The nose is mostly chocolate,coffee,and dark fruits.Mixed well with some toffee,and roasted malts.I'm almost getting some hints of spices too,but they are hard to identify.    The palate is chocolate,coffee,dark fruits,and roasted malts.I'm getting a small hint of alcohol,but nothing over the top.Nice little hop bite at the back end...Surprisingly smooth for a 10.5 abv beer.The body is thick,chewy,and a little bit sticky.    Overall this is a very good Imperial Stout.Nice blend of chocolate,coffee,and dark fruit,with highlights of spices,and a slight hint of alcohol,to add a nice edge.Definitely a keeper!!!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 L - Poured into a snifter. Ten FIDY pours an inky, motor oil brownish-black with a thick head of mocha-colored foam that gradually settles to a thick cap atop the beer. Some patches of lacing cling to the glass on the drink down.    S - Notes of heavily roasted grain, rich dark-chocolate cake, very overripe dark fruits, and a bit of coffee dominate the aroma. A mild, leafy hoppy character lingers behind all of the wonderful stout aromas. The 10.5% ABV is remarkably well hidden.    T - Flavors of bitter cocoa and heavy dark roast prevail. Chocolate lava cake comes to mind. A touch a hoppiness balances the decadent, rich chocolate and roast flavors. The same overripe dark fruit character of the aroma shows itself in some estery yeast and booze notes. Again, the 10.5% ABV is so well hidden, but it provides a pleasant phenol note to the big sweetness. The finish is surprisingly dry, but leaves a deep cholocatey note lingering on the palate.     F - About as viscous and "chewy" of a texture that I've ever encountered in an imperial stout. The perfect amount of carbonation bubbles allow the immense flavors to pop, but never get in the way.    O - A real benchmark for the style. One of the most chocolate-forward imperial stouts I've encountered. Remarkably balanced and "dry" for a beer of this stature. Each sip leaves you in anticipation of the next. Damn near perfect.

In the glass, it's midnight black, topped by a creamy, sticky brown head with surprisingly great retention, and leaves tons of tan lacing along the glass.    S: The aroma exudes dark chocolate, bitter baking cocoa, espresso, savory umami/beef broth, caramel, burnt sugar, pumpernickel bread and spice cake.    T: So much dark and bitter chocolate upfront. The mid-palate transitions to caramel, toffee, toasted pumpernickel bread, and spice cake. Some fig and brandy-soaked raisin as well. Just before it gets cloying, the finish transitions to a beautifully, pungently bitter earthy, espresso roast, tempered by savory, brothy, meaty umami, which lingers forever, continually teasing the palate between bitterness and sweetness.    F: Full-bodied, thick, creamy, and chewy; yet with a potent enough carbonation that the beer still flows smoothly and easily across the palate, behooving you to take the next gulp!    O: This is not only the best Oskar Blues beer and one of the best imperial stouts I've had, but one of the best beers I've ever had. It's so extremely complex, flavorful, and delectable, yet ridiculously drinkable. Absolutely incredible.

A: Pours jet black in color with a 1/4 inch, dark brown-khaki head with minimal retention. Small amounts of thin tan lacing throughout.    S: Notes of coffee, dark chocolate, toasted malts, vanilla, cinnamon, and other warm spices. Milder dark fruit notes including cherries and raisins.    T: Taste matches aromas well with toasted malt and strong coffee notes up front followed by bitter dark chocolate, cherry, and spice notes.    F: Full bodied, thick, smooth, and creamy with a small but good amount of carbonation.    O: Overall, a great Russian Imperial Stout. Well balanced. Top of the line stout for something that is readily available. This one aged extremely well! Wish I would've grabbed a couple more cans from that date.

Taste is smooth, hoppy, yet smooth, the hops and oats play well together, chocolate malt obvious. Caramel, coffee from the malt, even some sweetness that is vanilla like.     One of if not the best stout in a can (Santa Fe coffee stout comes to mind as a challenger). Excellent stuff.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 The beer was poured from a 12oz can into a tall snifter. There was no date or batch number on the can. I surmise this has worn off in the six years I’ve been storing it.     Appearance: Pours a beautiful pitch black with a rich creamy brown head. Head retention is lacking but there is a slight lace that remains for the entirety of the drink. The beer is impenetrable with a light red hue around the edges.     Smell: The aroma is complex and rounded, as if those several years of coexistence has brought all of the separate elements closer together. A woody alcohol pervades, with hints of dried dates and roasted and dark malts.    Taste: Very complex, slightly sweet, with a little bit of a bite on the end. Woody alcohol is most present, this gives way to a creamy, roasty grain flavor that turns a bit harsh on the back end. Notes of dried dates become more present as the beer begins to warm. Alcohol is relatively drying.     Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation, creamy, great mouthfeel. Some lingering sweetness that is nicely contrasted with the dryness of the malt.    Drinkability: Definitely cannot notice the high abv of this beer. It is incredibly drinkable on the warm Florida evening, I can imagine it is significantly more drinkable on a cool autumn night. Very glad I aged this one for a couple of years. I have had younger versions, and I always describe the flavors as sharp. This one has taken some time to blend all of its parts into a nice rounded drinkable, highly flavorful beer!     October, 7 2016	  Fort Myers, FL

The head lasts a while before blanketing the glass with sheets of lacing.    Big nose of chocolate, roasted malts, earthy tea-like hops and a little plum.    Similar flavors in the taste, but they come on in waves: first chocolate, then some hop bitterness, then roasted malts, a little nuttiness and a nice touch of alcohol. Quite artfully done.    Medium to heavy bodied, a bit slick, with heavy carbonation cutting through. This is a great beer.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 3.5 I am very disappointed in this years (2016) version of Ten Fidy. It is lacking the depth of the previous years. This version seems like it needs to age for a year or two. The fruit flavors almost seem spicy to me. I have tried 2 cans a week apart and they still seem off compared to previous releases. It seems to be lacking the depth of booze flavor from the past. Still a good beer, but not what it used to be!

Pitch black in the glass     Smell: big coffee, chocolate, overly ripe plum, generic dark fruit    Taste: raisins, chocolate, plums, finished with a coffee bitterness, not boozy at all but there is a small amount of warming     Feel: full, nice coating     Overall: top 2 or 3 non barrel aged stouts   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12oz can from Noble Grains NYC on the UES  Pours jet black with dark brown bubbly head that lingers, great lacing, smell is roasted chocolatey booze, taste is rich fudge, roasted sugary oats, bitter chocolate, slight warming booze, feel is thick and creamy. A huge imperial stout in such a small can, gets close to that African dirt taste that brings me back to my childhood. Yum!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 12/01/15 DOP can into snifter.    A - Looks very dark and thick, with a nice one-finger tan head greeting the pour. Head subsides after a minute, leaving impressive lacing on the glass.     S - dark chocolate, roasted coffee, caramel and toffee.    T - There are a lot of hops in this beer (98 IBU??), but they are nicely balanced by the robust dark chocolate and roasty characteristics.    M - One of the thicker beers out there. Just coats the tongue and envelops it in the awesome flavors of the beer! The 10.5% ABV is barely noticeable as well.    O - Great stout, especially with a bit of age on it - this allows the higher hop content to cool down a bit. Meaty, robust beer that grabs you by the balls and does not let go. However if you hate hops, stay away.

Aroma is big roasty malts, bakers chocolate, hints of coffee and dark fruit. A certain piney smell is somewhere in there as well. Taste is big roasty malt forward, hints of dark chocolate and pine as well. Very bitter and piney for a stout, but balances with the big roasted malt profile surprisingly well. Not your creamy and chocolaty stout. Mouthfeel is very thick, palate coating. Sticky and dry after taste. Not much ABV detected.

Extremely sexy looking brew.     Smells of bitter chocolate, sweet roasted malts, molasses, maybe some charred oak, raisins and plum. Coffee and sweet toffee. Pretty complex. Smells like a barrel aged stout. Slight burn from the Alcohol on the nose.     Taste like Molasses, sweet roasted malty caramel, Slighty oaky with a clean dry chocolate bitterness. Creamy coffee and bad to the bone. Extremely good and heavy bodied. A solid RIS, in a CAN!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Reviewing for the record, but you all already know this is pretty much a great RIS. I found a 4-pack at the local Bristol's in Westwood and had to get this before it disappeared. $17 for 4. Its reputation precedes it.    Pours black, the lacing is a torn curtain of perfection. Brown 1-finger head. Aroma is what you expect, coffee, chocolate, some rum, malt. Nothing wrong or unexpected.    Taste is char, malt, toffee, coffee, tobacco. Baker's chocolate in there, thick malts, smoky but not burnt, how to describe it? Steak, bread and your morning cold coffee thrown in. Hoppy bitter is lurking but nothing makes you throw it against the room. It's polite Russian imperialism. Incredibly well balanced, 10.5% is really hidden, no cola, no real sweetness, no metal. A deceptively simple, gateway Russian stout.    People who like more dark fruit might prefer Old Rasputin. Firestone's Parabola is richer, and just as hard to get a hold of. Ten Fidy has less character but also no false notes. Maybe nothing to fall in love with? Except a fine middle-of-the-road Russian stout.

Smells of pure roasted malt and cocoa. The taste follows closely with roasted malt, cocoa, and some earthy hops. The 2013 can had a noticeably stronger cocoa flavor. Nice body but lots of carbonation for the style. Fantastic smell/taste overall. Definitely one of the better non-BA stouts and easy to find. I wish Oskar Blues would can a nitro version of this.    Also had a 2012 can in Aug of 2016, dated 10/26/12 "Infioyous." Had a little less carbonation in the pour. Still retained lots of cocoa and some roasted malt flavor, but had oxidation in the smell/taste. Noticeable smoother/rounder. Almost like a smooth cocoa wine. It's a little past it's prime, but held up okay with 4 years on it.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Have really been wanting to try this beer, then lo and behold I saw it on tap at a local brewery. Dark as night and unexpectedly fruity for an imperial stout. Lots of chocolate and coffee and so many other delicious things. Felt no carbonation and didn't have the bitter clinging after taste that most imperial's have. Glad I got to try it.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 The body is as dark as a cup of coffee in a mineshaft at 2 am. The finger and a half head is cocoa brown and sinks down to a comfortable skim.     The aroma is a mix of licorice, molasses, and roasted barley smothered in a mocha blanket.     The taste is all about bakers chocolate, black coffee, roasty toasty barley, and it could not possibly get any better. The slight hop slap on the ass end is a welcome surprise.     Mouthfeel is smooth as greased glass.     Overall this brew most certainly lived up to it's reputation. Outstanding.

I was a little disappointed to see a canning date of 08/25/2013, so it is almost 1 year old.    Poured black with a thin caramel head.  Smells of chocolate and coffee.  Tastes chocolatey and boozy. Fairly well balanced.  Full of mouth feel and drank surprisingly easy.    Would like to try a fresh one in the future. Great beer, but for the price, I will look elsewhere in the future.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.75 UPDATE TO MY LAST REVIEW: I disliked this beer so much because it was so bitter and so disgustingly piney that I aged the beer for two years. I'm updating my original review to let everyone know that this beer becomes palatable after two years of aging. It becomes a totally different beer. The bitterness goes down tremendously and the pine notes go away. It actually becomes an ok beer. I would not buy this beer ever again but if somehow I received one I would age it. It becomes so much better. To be clear I'm a fan of tasty things (not bitter and not piney) but more of a smooth balanced flavor (sweet, malty, dark fruits, etc).       BELOW IS MY OLD REVIEW:    I saw the rating for this beer, I found it at my local beer shop, and had to buy it. I poured it into a tall glass to see it in all of its glory.    First lets go with the things I respect with this beer. This brew is inky black and the lacing on it is beautiful. It has a high 10.5% ABV also. That's where I have to stop. I respect what they are trying to do with this beer but I just can't appreciate it. Unfortunately I still have taste buds.    The negatives:  Smells like an IPA with roasted characteristics  Tastes like an IPA with dark characteristics (cocoa and some malt)  HIGH amount of hops and bitters. I just googled its IBU rating and its a 95!!! Holy crap, that's higher than some of the most bitter IPAs I've ever had.  $15 for a 4 pack.  It lingers in your mouth for minutes afterwards. You can literally taste it in your mouth 5 minutes after your last sip. To quote the movie Pineapple Express: "F'ing lingerer man, lingerer".    I just can't appreciate bitter beers. I just don't like to consume bitter things. The first thing I thought when I took my first sip was: "OMG, what sort of weirdo enjoys this!?". I'm a cook, I love cooking! The best way I could describe this in terms of a culinary meal would be like this: Go to a evergreen tree and take about 20 pine needles. Then take a teaspoon of pure cocoa powder. Put both of them in your mouth and chew. If you tell me that is delicious I'd think you need a health checkup. That is this beer in a nutshell. Incredibly piney with bitter cocoa. It just about turns your face inside out.    I had high hopes for this but I'm let down. Its one of those "America, F ya!!" sort of beers. Where they just put as much hops as possible just because its the American thing to do.    If I want a dark chocolate beer I'll just stick with my girly Samuel Smith's Organic Chocolate stout. :) I had no idea that this beer was going to be this bitter (95 IBU!!), I would have never paid 15 dollars for a 4 pack if I had known. I need to grow a thick beard and ride a unicycle before I can enjoy this level of manliness. I don't know how someone can pretend to enjoy this. I can't imagine what sort of food they call "good food". Meh, to each their own I guess.    look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A: Jet black. Black as coal. Impossibly dark. Substantial chocolate-brown head which stuck around for quite a while. Resilient, unmoving lacing. Gorgeous, everything an imperial should be.     S: Chocolate and dark coffee. Slight hop notes. Smells sticky and grainy.     T: Extremely balanced imperial. Equal parts coffee, chocolate, and malt. Absolutely delicious. Sweet and dark and rich. Booze is only present in the aftertaste, and given that this beer is 10.50%, it is subdued. Nice hop balance on this one, more substantial than most imperials. Compared to Rasputin, this is a noticeably hoppy beer, but in a very dank way.    M: Carbonation is fairly light. Creates a beautifully creamy texture. Perfection. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, sticky and dark.     O: A truly phenomenal beer. As close to perfection as I could ask for. Sweet and rich and full. I will buy as much as I can, whenever I see it.

Interesting that my canned four pack was packaged 10/7/15. This little detail really gets me thinking. What are you up to, Oscar Blues Brewery, you rascals, you.    This is the strongest 5 i've ever given for feel. It's perfection reinvented, evolved, torn down, reinvented again, reborn, reperfected. Its true nature evades description and can be found only in experience.   The taste is beyond exquisite. An extremely high 5. 97th percentile-ish i'd say. Triumphant over Old Rasp or Narwhal by a good margin. No small feat. Fort George's Cavatica is a dog chasing this car. Renegade's RIS chases closer. Even More Jesus territory.  Smell is impeccable. ever so slightly harsh. Still impeccable.  Looks Beautiful. got this baby to a 4 inch, creeeeaaaamy, bubble rich, roaming, foam. wait, is this a fucking root beer float? Upon slurping, this foamy draught will give you things its solely liquid progenitor could never dream up.  This beer is Home.   Drink On,  Friends!

SO RICH AND THICK, blacker than the blackest blackety black, with a Carmel head and sticky lacing. My lips were literally sticking to my glass as I reluctantly pulled away. ABV seemed subdued and IBUs, by my best guess, were swallowed up by the dense black hole that is this RIS. I vaguely remember several months ago my bottle shop guy said he had some BA Ten Fidy that he would recommend, and, well, I'm a moron. I really wish time travel was possible...maybe if I get swallowed by this black hole it will take me into a wormhole and ?..BEST RIS IN A 12 oz CAN IMHO.

A perfect example of an RIS. The chocolate, coffee, and caramel are merely additions to a great malt backbone. How is this 98 IBUs? The bitterness is there, but it's more like a dark chocolate bitter -- not at all like an IPA that is 98 IBUs.     Overall, it exceeded expectations. I am looking forward to the bourbon barrel aged version!

This is very, very good.

It is 10.5% ABV, 98 IBU, pours thick and dark, smells like beer, can taste the alcohol, slightly bitter but not overwhelming, pretty good. Sure would not have guessed it is 98 IBU, seems more like 60.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 12 fl oz. can, canned on 10.07/15. Finally getting around to reviewing this classic from Oskar Blues; my first can of Ten Fidy. Acquired a single can of this stuff from the local bottle shop.    Poured into a Duvel tulip snifter.    A - Pours a thick oily black body, probably the thickest blackest beer I've ever seen poured from a can. Pours sleek and silently and conjures about a finger of dark mocha chocolate head that falls to a ring and leaves a nice surface skimming. Minor spotty lacing. Looks very nice.    S - Aroma is all malt-forward: roasty, musty, a slight floral alcohol note to it, though i wouldn't attribute any of it to hops. There are subtle hints at milk chocolate & cream, but the earthy / musty / band-aid fumes seem to dominate just a bit. Hints of dark fruits: raisins, dates, figs.    T - Taste is smooth, creamy, sticky, sugary, sweet. Notes of chocolate, vanilla, marshmallow fluff, dark barley roast, malt bitterness, notes of dark fruits: raisin, dates, figs.    M - Mouthfeel is ridiculously smooth & creamy. Not coarse or rough in any way, no lingering char or bitterness. Smooth, milky, & creamy feel all around. Exceptionally easy-drinking stuff for the high abv. Sticky, sugary, sweet, very thick body. Definitely a dessert beer.    Overall, a nice big bad canned imperial stout; easily the best beer I've had from Oskar Blues so far, and well-deserving of the good ratings and reputation that it has. I don't know why i waited so long to try this classic.    Oskar Blues Ten Fidy -----4.5/5

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 The beer is served in 12 oz goblet. It is black in color and has a 1/4" dark tan head. Sipping leaves lacing on the sides of the glass.    The aromas include dark roasted malt, some chocolate and dark fruits.    As expected from the nose the flavors are dark roasted malt, some chocolate and some dark fruits. There's also a bit of light sweetness.    The mouthfeel is on the full side of medium bodied and quite soft with very moderate but persistent carbonation. The finish begins as the stronger flavors start to fade, the hint of sweetness disappears and everything comes to a slightly bitter ending.    Overall, a very well made stout that I'll probably be having again but only as a special treat. Given the ABV this is a one a night beer.

Stellar beer...

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 L -- Jet black with a thick, frothy mocha colored head. Not a ton of lacing on this one as the ring that develops around the edge as the head recedes doesn't stick.     S -- Roasted sweet coffee, plum, molasses, dark chocolate.     T -- Roasted malts of coffee and chocolate, tons of them. Not cloyingly sweet either, but there's a definite sweetness that helps to balance out the roasted notes. Lots of stone fruit flavors in this and it melds together incredibly well. I keep thinking to myself that this should taste sweeter than it does while being very happy it does not.     F -- Viscous is the best description. Thick and creamy and just full enough that you don't go through the beer quickly, but it also doesn't feel like syrup.    O -- Really fantastic. This is damn near a perfect beer for a cold and dreary night. Or just dreary. Or night. Or day. Or you've already caught my drift and realized I'm saying this would be great whenever.

Has a tan colored head that lasts for quite a while and leaves abundant lacing. Smells like dark fruit (plum, raisin), dark roasted coffee, and dark chocolate. Taste is more of the same: big, roasted flavors, with some marshmallow, molasses, and leathery smokiness. Great balance between sweet and bitter, it has a noticeable hop presence that helps it finish dry. Feels luxurious...really thick, creamy, and full bodied. This beer is damn near close to perfect, as far as I'm concerned.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This one pours a nice ruby blackish color with a tan head that is lively and settles slow leaving lacing down the glass.    The nose is very complex and rich with notes of dates, prunes, coffee, dark chocolate and raisins. The hops are there but so heavily blended with the richness of this Imperial Stout that I am pleasantly surprised they so present in the taste.    The taste is a pleasant , belly warming experience. This one ios a warmer, meets a lager meets an Imperial Stout. There are rich flavors that hint at numerous spices. I get fig, prunes., raisins, bread, plums, chocolate and bitter hops that end on a mild sour note.    The mouthfeel is very rich and helps the palate to experience the complexity.    Overall, an exceptional Imperial Stout and is perfect for a cold day to help get the blood pumping. I suggest a rich aged Cheddar, Gouda or Stilton cheese to go with this one.

Pours mega black. The main thing here is the taste. My god is it amazing. It is dessert in a can, yet isn't too sweet and finishes dry. Lots of chocolate, malt, certainly a little roasty.    Those that aren't fans of high ABV stouts that yield too much heat will love this. There isn't a single person I've shared this with that hasn't enjoyed it. If you are skeptical, give it a shot. You will love it.

Pours totally black with three monster fingers of creamy brown head that leaves elaborate honeycomb lace as it recedes. Intimidating.    Smells of rich dark fudge, slightly creamy coffee, dried dark fruit, campfire smoke, sweet black licorice and ghostly earthy hops.    Taste is a velvet battering ram of gooey black chocolate and rich coffee. Chocolate cake, roasted caramel, more dried dark fruit and candied nuts, black licorice, vanilla pods and more faint hops.    Feels thick and silky. Full bodied with creamy carbonation. Finishes dry.    Verdict: Vigorously recommended. One of the heavyweight champions.

For me all the elements were there including the hops but I'm just a little shy on the 96 overall myself.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured at 51°F from a 12oz can (canned on 01Dec15) into a snifter. Consumed on 14Mar16.  LOOK: Pours with a fingers worth of cinnamon colored foam. At 25 seconds, the foam head changes color to light brown. At 2 minutes and 15 seconds, the head has dissipated into a quarter fingers worth, leaving behind a moderate amount of thick lacing. Black in color, with an orange luster. I cannot see any rising bubbles. Lacing is moderate in quantity and thick with a few areas being very thick.  SMELL: Strong aromas of sweetened coffee, sweet chocolate, and molasses deliciously entangle with mild aromas of plums and sweet black cherries along with subtle bitter roasted malt and vanilla aromas. Hints of alcohol are also present.   TASTE: Strong sweetened coffee, molasses, and sweet chocolate flavors initially bombard the palate, forming an instant and loveable flavor of sugary goodness. Mild bitter roasted malt flavors immediately follow and prevent any cloying. Mild plum and sweet black cherry flavors along with subtle vanilla enter next and further sweeten the taste. Subtle sweet oats and hints of alcohol make thier apperance as all previous flavors persist.   FEEL: Very full-bodied with hints of carbonation. This almost feels like syrup because of how thick it is. Goes down incredibly smooth and creamy while also clinging to the back of the throat. A mild and welcoming alcoholic warmth can be felt as it goes down the throat. Finishes with a strong and nearly unwelcoming dryness.  NOTE: A beer that is justifiably hyped. While some of the brews in the style are just overly bitter, this was a perfect combination between that and sweet. I'm going to be letting one age to see what wonders time will do.

Shiny and opaque with a thick frothy brown head. head dissipates leaving some minimal lacing and a thin film of tan foam along the outside edge of the beer.     Smell is like a chocolate malt shake. Tons of milk chocolate and dark chocolate aromas with roasted malts come through. Hints of smoked malts with undertones of molasses and maybe some dried cherries.    Taste has notes of chocolate, dark chocolate with roasted malts and a smokey character. Undertones of dark cherries and mild molasses. All coming back to the roasted malts. In the middle there is a real bitterness - a hop bitterness - but then as the stout goes down the flavors just mellow out into this beautiful lingering mellow malty chocolate cake flavor. Just amazing. Alcohol is well hidden but as you sip it you start to notice it as it warms your face.     Mild carbonation. There is a real thickness to the beer - its doesn't just look like crude oil, it has that same thick consistency. Great feel.     Overall a standout Imperial Stout. possibly the best part? Its in CANs!!

Rich smell goes with the strong rich taste. This is the great thing about this beer. There is strong chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt taste, but all are well balanced. All without the boozy taste that often makes an imperial stout only an occasional treat for me. I can see this beer becoming a regular in the frig as it has become available nearby.

Taste: roast, dark chocolate, dark cherry, mild maple and vanilla, more roast. Not too sweet or bitter.    Feel: thick, but with a good level of carbonation for the style.    Overall: very solid.

Smells of roasted malts, dark chocolate, dark cherries, coffee and cocoa. Tastes like dark chocolate, espresso, dark fruit, roasted malts and caramel. Well balanced flavours, leaning slightly towards chocolate bitter, which is a plus for me. Thick, viscous mouthfeel, low carbonation and a very bitter and full of chocolate aftertaste.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours near black from a can into a stout glass. Thick khaki head with solid retention but little to no lacing. Dissipates pretty quickly to a thin ring of foam.    Nose is huge on roasted malt - slight chocolate and tobacco notes.     Flavor follows - big roasted malt bill, nice rich character of leather, chocolate, hints of coffee and tobacco. Definitely some hop notes, but they feel a bit faded. Not sure how old this can is but it doesn't take away from the beer. It's not as though it's too sweet without it.     It is a bit thin for me. The mouthfeel overall is nice, rich, and full but it's definitely a bit more thin than I'd like.

Didn't get much of a licorice taste, but more of a roasted nut and chocolate taste, along with a nice hidden alcohol burn for the aftertaste.   Creamy and full body flavor. Excellent Russian Imperial Stout!

I'll drink a hundred Pinners, rather than a Ten Fidy. Love Oskar Blues. Especially the new (Blue) IPA.

AROMA: Not a huge aroma from this. Very dark roasted malt. Some dark chocolate. A little alcohol. Slight coffee and black licorice.  TASTE: Alcohol, dark chocolate. Dark roasted malt. There is a bit of sweet malt up front and then a fairly strong dose of bitterness to finish.  FEEL: Medium-thin body. Nice level of carbonation. A bit sticky at first, then dry on the finish.  OVERALL: A little on the thin side in comparison to other RIS's I have had.. Mostly just some bittersweet chocolate and alcohol. Does have a pretty nice lasting bitterness.

T/F: Bitter roast mixed with sweet malts... coffee for sure, cocoa nibs on the flavor... hickory wood and burned sugar. Thick and creamy... smooth... warming on the back of the palate.    O: This is one a$$ kicking Imperial Stout, with great complexity and depth of flavor.... just what I want from the style. Would love to try a barrel aged version at some point. Just lovely, and thanks again to the folks at Oskar Blues.

Look: Pours and settles a viscous pitch black, with impressive three finger porous mocha colored head from an aggressive pour.    Smell: Rich roast coffee and dark bakers chocolate up front, followed by some sweet dark fruit, black licorice, and charred wood, all backed by some light alcohol.    Feel: Unbelievable smooth body, with some light carbonation on a full body.    Taste: Perfectly balanced; dark chocolate, dark fruit, caramel, toasty oat, roast coffee, and some boozy alcohol. Aftertaste is bittersweet and dry.    Overall: It is difficult for me to put into words how good this is. Amazing balance here, ABV is concealed very well. I wish I could have a glass of this every night.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours thicker and blacker than Satan's blood - even the head is among the darkest I've ever seen.    Nose is an interesting mix of coffee, roasted barley, and hoppy bitterness, mixed with dark chocolate fudge, smoke, cocoa, and Satan's blood.    Taste is similar, but throw a bit of licorice in there. Truly, the greatest accomplishment of this beer is how it manages to be savory rich, toasty bitter, and malty, chocolatey sweet all at the same time, with all 3 flavors pushing and kicking each other around, vying for attention. This beer is a fighter! Worth the price of admission to the match, every time!

Best stout I've ever had out of a can, hands down.

Price: $4.99  Purchased: Jan. 13, 2016  Consumed: Jan. 24, 2016  Misc.: Canned on Sept. 22, 2015 at 11:07 a.m. MT    I’d been looking forward to reviewing this for a long time. I had it in September 2014 out in North Carolina, but did not review it then. It’s good to see Ten Fidy out there instead of just the main Dale Pale’s Pale Ale, Old Chub, Mama’s Little Yella Pils, etc. A bit pricy for a can, but this was a must have.    Poured a black oil color with two fingers of dark tan, fizzy head, which thinned out fairly quickly. Good amount of spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. Below average retention. (Sight - 4.00)    Smelled chocolate, boozy licorice, caramel syrup, Jägermeister, roasted toffee, dark cocoa powder and chocolate syrup. (Smell - 4.50)    Taste follows the nose, although maybe not quite as good. Got boozy milk chocolate up front, followed by bitter smoky licorice, caramel syrup, dry roasted molasses, herbal hops, chocolate cake, some char wood and dark fruit. (Taste - 4.25)    Full body. Chewy, thick texture. Average carbonation. Long, warming finish. (Feel - 4.25)    This was even better than I remembered it. Looking forward to eventually trying some of the variants.

Look: Black like the night. 5 fingers of thick, fluffy, mocha brown head that takes its sweet time and gives me time to build up the anticipation. Gorgeous lacing as the head slowly dies.    Smell: Amazing complexity: dark roastiness, fruity like raisins or port wine, dark chocolate.    Taste: Excellent balance of sweet and bitter. A hint of burnt coffee.    Feel: Little to no carbonation; maybe it all came out into the head. Thick, creamy body.    Overall: A fantastic example of the style. Oskar Blues delivers once again.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Pours thick, oily black out of the can. Big dark tan head hangs on for a while, light film on top of the deep black body till the close.    Smells awesome, really get the chocolate notes on top of the roasted malts. Hits the mouth just as thick as it looks. Medium carbonation opens up and it has a really nice feel. Massive bitterness is well blended into the stout, step for step with the sweeter flavors before taking control at the finish.    Overall, this is one of the best RISs I've had. I was apprehensive because of the can and whatever, but the hype is real. For comparison, I just finished an Old Rasputin - which I really like - and it was beyond obvious that the Ten FIDY was the superior beer.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Oh snap! If you are dark beer lover as I am, this is a superpower of the genre. And by that I mean not only the taste, but also the wallop. Not for the faint of heart, this beer pours as used motor oil with a thin caramel-colored head. Yeah, licorice, burnt toast, coffee, blah, blah, blah. Very flavorful but, let's be honest, it is hard to conceal 10.5% ABV. There is s distinct alcohol taste that numbs the tongue after a while. This is a must-try if you enjoy hefty brews but stop yourself after two pints or so, for your own good.

Pours pitch black with a dense tan head that lasts a couple minutes and leaves lots of lace on the glass.    S: 4.25 As soon as the can is cracked, there’s a good dose of roasted malt, dark chocolate, and coconut that fills the room. Licorice, dark roast coffee, and vanilla show up as the beer opens up a bit.    T: 4.25 Taste is slightly sweet with strong roasted malt and dark chocolate. Anise-type bitterness comes through, mixing between sweeter flavors of vanilla and coconut and the more dominant roasted malt and subtle tobacco. Fairly strong malt and hop bitterness lingers on the finish.     M: 4.75 Body is thick and chewy with just the right amount of carbonation. Just about perfect in this regard.     O: 4.25 This is a classic example of a pure, imperial stout. Great flavors and aromas with good roasted malt presence, and a thick body. The bitterness on the finish is a bit much for my preference, but it’s still an excellent stout.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Update 1/15/16: been too damn long since I imbibed this treasure. What prompted the edit? One word. On the can. Had to look it up. Can't remember needing to use the dictionary to look up the meaning of a word on a label or the printing on a can of beer. What is the world coming to? Cancupiscent. Not a recognized word, but a play on concupiscent. Translation: beer lust. It is. And, what synchronicity. As I opened the can, my playlist shuffle began playing the "ten fingers of doom." Yeah, Ted Nugent's Stranglehold. Which is what this beer has me in. This is the best beer in a can. Period. Exclamation. No hung jury. Out of cliches.    I upgraded the look, smell, and taste. Very affordable too!    I accidentally deleted my original review from 2010. Oops. Not BA website fault. Mine. And the buzz.      Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter glass. Single purchased from a health food store for $2.99. I drink to my health, or not.    L-Pours a virtually black hue, nearly the color of the can, with a two finger, dark creamy tan head with good retention and modest lacing.     S-Deep, dark chocolate and toasted malts and dried fruits like raisins, dates, and prunes. Coffee and vanilla also noted. Very nice and appropriate for style. Burst forth as soon as the tab is raised. Awesome.    T-Good, but not equal to the anticipation I expected from the aroma. Malty sweetness, but not nearly as complex as the aroma. Rich, creamy with some smokiness, and the alcohol is hardly noticeable, which is quite an accomplishment for a beer of this gravity. This is better in 2016 (canned 12/15) than in 2010.     F-Medium to full body, with a nice level of carbonation.    O-Quite good for a RIS, especially from a can. Nice that it comes in a 12 oz. serving. Wouldn't want a bomber all by myself. A definite sipping beer this one, or a getting drunk one.

A thick full mouthfeel, good toasty and Roasty notes intertwined with a big bite of booze. Some underling bitterness at the back. A definite boozy bomb of rich flavor. Delicious.

Taste is perfect imperial stout, loads of sweet roasty malts and not even a note of booze. Way too easy to drink. Many have suggested cellaring this readily available brew, which I am doing with the other 3.    Edit: I was almost finished drinking this when my little daughter knocked over the glass onto the coffee table. This beer is too good and expensive to waste so I mopped up with a paper towel and wrung it out into my glass. How's that fact for a review?

Black as night and completely opaque. Unable to see any light from a flashlight shone through it.     Smell: Sweet, toasty and smoky. Chocolate predominates. Smells distinctly alcoholic; almost like a spirit.    Taste: Sweet, toasty and malty off the top, giving way to alcoholic astringency which quickly dissipates. Pleasantly bitter between sips. As it warms the coffee and chocolate flavors come bursting through    Feel: Moderate carbonation, moderate-thick mouthfeel. Can feel the heat from the >10% ABV    Overall: A formidable stout. A little expensive for regular drinking however. My only wish is that it hid the alcohol a bit better, it felt like I was sipping on a spirit at times, not a beer.

Looks fabulous in the snifter.     Either caramel or toffee smell for me, nothing overpowering but it is very sweet smelling, got a hint of cinnamon as well. Nothing outstanding here for me.    wow, that is a tasty imperial stout. it is sweeter than I anticipated on the front with chocolate and toffee, coffee, a layer of malt and a bit of alcohol bite follows. my knock on many imperials is the alcoholic bitterness left in your mouth after a sip, that isn't present here at all.    The mouth feel, like the pour is exquisite. For all the hops/malts jammed into this one, the fact they pulled off such a smooth mouth feel is really something special. Bravo OB.

I should have trusted my instincts though because I was always turned off by it's can hear it's appearance. Finally I decided to try it and was hugely disappointed. It had sort of a sweet or milk stouttaste to it in its middle which I really really didn't like. It was almost syrupy and it tasted quite awful. I think I'll stick with founders breakfast stout

Lacing sticks to the glass after the froth has receded to being a frame for the drink, and with turning the beer round in the glass, it lingers in pleasant, rhythmic sheets.    The immediate and sustaining smell is boozy, inviting rather than overpowering, but rather simple, dominating, and unabating. Makes me think this is a great candidate for aging. (Will find out, as I have a 2014 can in the wings.)    The presentation is in part exceptional, unusual, and modest, but it reveals its greatness in the taste -- more specifically, not just in delivering on its prologue, but bringing in more characters. A great smokiness , some malty sweetness that's balanced superbly with a coffee-like bite. It also, like a great tune, keeps some of its early motifs, but working in harmony with the new strains.    The feel is a slightly syrupy, creamy medium heavy body that doesn't wow with its weight, but still brings what you expect from a stout.    In contrast to something such as Founder's Breakfast -- one of my favorites -- which is more of a refined dressy dinner dessert stout, this is a rustic, Siberian bar stout. A boozy, smoky, bitter, ruffian's stout.

Taste: Matls, caramel, coffee, and bitter earthy hops all the way through the finish.    Feel: The balance of malts and hops is well done upon initial taste, a little harsh on the bitter hop finish though. Not too thick and hits with the right level of carbonation.

Taste is huge, with a bitter dark chocolate bite, a touch of stone and/or tropical fruit, light toast, caramel, and a lingering herbal, coffee roast, dark cocoa aftertaste. Feels medium bodied with light carbonation, creamy and chewy. Overall, a really great imperial stout. Unique but still spot on with stout flavor. The abv is undetectable. Really well made stout.

F - 10% the brew really coats mouth with slight carbonation that gives it just the right kick  O - really good imperial stout. This is a beer to sip on and enjoy the flavor changes as the temperature of the beer changes. I really enjoyed this beer and drank it over a 45 min time frame. Cheers

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I've been drinking this RIS for several years and was surprised to see that I hadn't reviewed it before. Poured into snifter. The color is a deep mahogany-black with a two-finger, mocha-colored head and lacing. It's a very attractive pour. The aroma is decadent: dark chocolate, coffee, malt, some vanilla, and a distinct alcohol smell. What a taste! tons of dark chocolate, burnt coffee, dark fruit, and a bit of bitter hops at the finish. The alcohol is also evident. As if all this weren't enough, this stout pours from the can like motor oil: super thick and creamy; you can practically chew it. There is a significant alcohol burn. Overall, this is truly a superior RIS. It really deserves its stellar reputation.

I consider it very smooth with a malty barley taste with coffee, black licorice and caramel undertones. This beer is one to try every winter. Great to sip or share around Christmas.
