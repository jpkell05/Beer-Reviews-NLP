look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.25 From 530 mil bottle into pint glass. L. Initial inch of light tan, tightly bubbled head over black body. Head subsides to about 1 cm but remains throughout most of the bottle. S. Slightly pungent, yeasty, a touch of fruit, grain. T. A surprise up front, quite strong molasses/vegemite (Promite or Marmite equivalent), liquorice with a little grain. Not sweet at all, and finishes quite dry. F. Has that silky feel of oatmeal stouts but otherwise lighter than expected. Don't really notice carbonation. O. Obviously an iconic stout but quite different to the oily, choc/coffee ones that seem so prevalent (which I love, by the way). Surprisingly drinkable and easy to put a way a few!   
look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4 Light chocolate, oat smell. Taste is a little bitter at first, then you really taste the oats and a hint of raisin and a lot of malt. Drink ability is very good.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 550ml bottle    Pours a wonderful finger and a half of light brown head into my Samuel Smith nitro (British pint) glass. Looks very creamy and pillowy. Body is completely black, even when held up to the light, only small hues of mahogany appear. Head retention was maybe a touch better than average. A sturdy film, along with good initial lacing is left behind. Overall it looks quite nice so far.    Up front the nose has the sweet british malt aroma, almost molasses esque. A little bitterness/sour aroma. Notes of velvet chocolate. Not getting much of the traditional roasty or oatmeal notes, but I'm not used to drinking british beers. Overall very sweet, almost desert like, with a little bitterness at well. Smells pretty good.    It's pretty well balanced on the flavor. Not nearly as sweet as the nose would indicate, which is totally fine. Somewhat surprising hop presence, not terribly high, but again, way more than the nose suggested. Not really much oatmeal, that aspect stays true. Maybe just a hair of roasted malt, along with a nice malty backbone. Light caramel notes, though not biscuity. Very nice flavor.    Mouthfeel is interesting. Pretty light bodied, almost crisp. Carbonation is about medium. The beer is malty on the flavor, but there aren't any invasive sugars, it drinks relatively dry - pretty sure I like that aspect a fair amount. Yeah, it rounds out to be a super crushable stout, and doesn't assault my mouth with sticky sugars.    The drinkability is very high overall. It's tasty, light, dry, and goes down easy.    The appearance turned out decent. Lacing was present throughout most of the glass, but was certainly a little patchy. Tough one to grade here because it started out pretty strong. I think it's still a pretty good looking beer overall.    Overall this is a really pleasant beer to drink. Pretty flavorful, well balanced, dry and sessionable as well.   
look: 3 | smell: 1 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 550ml bottle into a pint glass.     Pours jet black w/eggshell white head. Smells of biscuit/white bread crust/dark fruits. Taste is the same w/chocolate and malt. Mouth feel is creamy and smooth. Over all a delightfully delicious stout. A solid A +. Abv 5% so I can drink two pints easily.

The pour produces 2+ fingers of variously bubbled frothy, somewhat lasting, mocha head that a moderate coating of lace. Aroma is dark malt notes of chocolate, fig, prune with hints of coffee and anise. Faint hops in the background. Taste is roasted malt notes of Tootsie Roll chocolate, toasted dark bread, molasses, prune, faint smoke with a light bitter character initiating at mid-sip, intensifying in the finish and rapidly diminishing in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to low-heavy body with low-moderate carbonation, smooth and creamy.

Very rich, very earthy.    T: Almost no carbonation. Starts off with a slight bitter chocolate, then mellows and sweetens. Finishes dry. Don't really taste the oatmeal. Maybe it contributes to that creaminess.     O: Well made stout, super smooth. It just lacked a little something, maybe not the big smell or flavor I expected.

The flavours has good tones of coffee, chocolate and dark and dried fruits. The finish is roasted with a slight bitterness. Aftertaste is strong and has a great lenght. The flavours are balanced very well and it goes down so easy. Mouthfeel is silky and smooth. Medium carbonation with a medium body. One of the better oatmeal stouts i had. Delicious flavour.

Smells of dark chocolate, a little coffee and malt. Tastes of coffee, mocha chocolate and caramel. Nice smooth malt backbone. Only very mild hint of bitterness, very smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Small amount of carbonation that’s just right. Nice and light, could definitely see myself drinking multiples of this beer. Will check out other offerings from this brewery.

Thick foamy tannish head... great retention and lacing.    S: Roasted grains and sugars... sweet... espresso and dark chocolate.    T/F: Follows the nose... dark roast character... burned sugars and coffee. Cocoa present... mildly sweet... smooth and creamy on the mouth. Mild hopping for bitterness. Medium to light bodied.    O: A delicious and super drinkable stout... bittersweet and roasty... and at only 5% ABV makes this is one you can sip or slam. Great beer from a great brewery.

Poured into a glass the beer is pitch black plum in color with a short-lived one-finger foam. Creamy and thick, oily and warm in the body, just right carbonation. Mouth is roasted cocoa and rye upfront, followed by some delicate and clean hoppy bitterness. An excellent beer, definitely worth trying. Bravo, Samuel Smith.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4 Purchased March 2018. 550ml bottle. No bottling date on bottle.     Pour: poured into a pint glass. Dark brown with a little amber coming through when held to light. One finger head that slowly dissipates into a thin tan film and ring. Nice look.     Nose: slight roasted malt, chocolate, burnt toast. But very slight. Maybe impacted by pint glass and currently stuffed nose!    Taste: roasted sweet malt, mild dark chocolate, bitter hops on the finish. Nothing over powering in thevtaste but quietly pleasant.     Mouthfeel: this is where SSOS stands out. Creamy, silky, smooth in the mouth. Medium carbonation is just right and tingles in your mouth. Really delightful and easy to drink but substantial enough.     Overall: when you want a pleasant, easy drinking stout, this is a great choice. ABV is only 5% so you can easily enjoy this nearly anytime. A go to beer.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 This is one of my two favorite beers. It is what you might call a chewy stout. It's extremely thick, yet fizzy, and filled with flavor. From the first whiff to the aftermath, it screams grains and a hint of brown sugar. The bottle is a presentation on its own, and it pours smooth and silky as any good stout should. It's far from the cheapest beer out there, but it's not among the most expensive either, and it sticks to you like a good meal. Others fight for a title, but this just delivers with a smooth, filling drink. This is definitely a winter beer, and it has all the right notes for winter. Nothing about it is truly overt, flavor-wise, even if the beer itself demands your attention.     You tend to forget it has alcohol, but you don't forget that it's a beer. The solid malty notes come from its flavoring, which omits hops entirely in favor of flaked oats and the brewing crystal and chocolate malts as well as roasted barley which all come through masterfully in the final product. If you want to get into beer tasting, this is a great way to start, unless you hate being disappointed after your initial trials! Go ahead and swig some overly-priced microbrew IPAs and Hefeweizens if you'd like to start out with painful starts, but this is the way to go if you want to start out with something delicious.

A: pours black with some transluscence at the edge and two fingers of thick tan head that retains well and leaves loads of went lacing.    S: sweet dark fruit, raspberries? Chocolate covered strawberries? Like 80% dark cocoa.    T: arrives mildly sweet, with some dark fruit, slightly sour (again, raspberry?), followed by malty sweetness and dark unsweetened cocoa. Had this at dinner so couldn't plumb the depths, but I am not doing this justice. Layers of fruity, cocoa, and roast complexity with some esters and hops.    M: Mid-weight and well-carbonated. Cleaner finish than expected.    O: this was an outstanding stout. Fruity, chocolatey, complex, and lightly bitter. Supremely drinkable at 5% ABV, and clean finishing but not thin. Superb beer on its own orvwith food. I've never seen it in a six pack, but I would buy a six pack of it if they were available to me.

The aroma is a dry roast nuts light chocolate and black licorice.  The flavor is dry and roasty with a light sweet chocolate flavor. There's a faint cola in the background that stays through the finish.  The mouthfeel is creamy and full with unnoticeable carbonation. Fairly standard for an oatmeal stout.  This is a classic I had to try, but honestly there are better oatmeal stouts. I prefer rover truck from TG and it's cheaper and in a can.

I repeat: on draft!!! In Ohio!!! How cool is it that we get to experience this for the first time ever in the United States?    Appearance is classic black with a coffee brown sheen and a thick, creamy tan blanket that persists for a good while and clings in sheets.    Smell is toasty malt with nutty accents, cola, and a slightly pungent note of what might be pine, but is otherwise escaping me.    Taste is mixed nuts, light cocoa and tobacco in front of hints of smoke, black cherry, and a faint touch of Tootsie Roll deep in middle, with a slightly bitter but tangy finish.    Body is smooth, light to medium with a slick, round, semi-wet swallow. This is very easy drinking for an Oatmeal Stout, and enjoyably so.

Bubbly in appearance - could pass for a very dark root beer!    S: Roasty and sweet, hinting in the direction of a wine smell! Malt and toasted oats give way to barley and water. A little bit of chocolate.     T: Predicted very well by the smell. Add to that, it's bubbly and refreshing. Slightly sweet and boozy, which is surprising given the light ABV.    F: Bubbly and light in the mouth, just a little nod in the direction of thick syrup without going in that direction much at all.    O: A well-balanced classic that one could drink quite a few of! In fact, I'm afraid I've never housed a sixer of these... What a dark smooth trip that would have been. Knock it back, y'all, this one is a stone house fixture on the battlefield of the beer landscape. Some crusty old general is holed up inside, not plotting advances for his troops, but in fact holding down the hill that he's held for the past two weeks straight. Solid. Dependable. And thankfully, a widely available general too (you can find him on the shelf of any beer store worth its salt I've been to in the US, at least).    There's one thing to with this one... KNOCK IT BACK!    Cheers.

Smell is a rich pungent aroma of rich roasted malts, milk chocolate, toffee, and caramel.     Taste follows the nose with rich roasted malts up front. Notes of milk chocolate, toffee and caramel come through. Touch of bittering hops on the finish with a second wave of chocolate. At room temperature, there is a slight sour note on the back end - faint but noticeable.     Feel is thin, very smooth, with fizzy carbonation.     Overall this is a classic outstanding oatmeal stout.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 The appearance was an exceptionally dark brown colored body that yields a foamy brown three finger head that lasted for most of the beer. A beautiful spider web lacing clung to the sides of the glass. The body was too dark for any carbonation to be seen rising. The smell had some chocolate up front and very strong. Once it warmed a bit some caramels and nuts came out. The taste brought back the chocolate but it seemed it was more combined with the other flavors of caramel, nuts and some light toffee as well. On the palate, it sat at/about a heavy with a dry finish and left nothing harsh on my tongue. This is not a sessionable beer despite the low ABV. Overall, I thought this was a very good beer and am glad it was as heavy as it was. This would make an exceptional dessert beer.

Tastes like nutty toasted bready graham crackery malts, chocolate, acidic coffee, roasty molasses, caramel, buttery toffee, dried fruit, apple, pear, oats, with floral earthy herbal grassy pine.

This beer has remained in my top 10 for at least ten years, and for good reason. I know of no other stout that tastes quite like this. One of the greatest beers in the world right here.

S: Dark roast malts, with black coffee, dark chocolate, molasses/cane, perhaps hazelnut evident.  T: Rich dark roast malt flavor with more sweet biscuit or toffee flavor in nice balance with the bitterness of the hops.  M: Full bodied with persistent effervescence: a mouthful, so to speak.

The tan head is large thick and lasting with good lacing. The nose is sweet and malty with fruity esters and chocolate. Slightly tangy and less flavorful than the nose would suggest, it tastes mostly of roasted malts, oats and semi-sweet chocolate. The bitterness is moderate. Medium bodied with low carbonation it goes down rather smooth.    All in all a pretty good oatmeal stout.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Quick long story short....when I was in my late teens (late 1970's) my big bro and I went to England... Our favorite 3 things to do: 1. See the sights ...mainly castles/cathedrals/museums..2. Eat good food. 3. Hit every pub ( they serve you if you can see over the bar) in each small village to try their local brews...we like what were called bitters. ...low carbonated, hand pump- pulled from the cellar. Then finally we Americans started to brew like the old country. So this stout hits the mark because it's from there and follows the recipe of rich, dark toasted oatmeal/nutty/coffee flavors.

S: Milk chocolate, brandy soaked cherries, plums, figs, and raisins; big brown bread and slight vanilla sweetness.    T: Mostly tons of dark fruit. Cherries, figs, plums, and raisins. Some milk chocolate and vanilla sweetness. Toasted brown bread malt character. Hints of anise and licorice spice. A bit of coffee roast. Finishes lighter than expected.    F: Medium-bodied. Not quite creamy, but smooth and pleasant to drink.    O: The staple oatmeal stout? Decent enough. Was expected more creaminess and robust roastiness, but I love the dark fruit character and quaffability. Brings aspects of all expected stout elements, from chocolate and coffee to vanilla and caramel, bread and spice.

S -- Quite reminiscent of their nut brown ale -- lots of chocolate, scotch, brown sugar, oats, barley malts, raisins, and dark fruits.   T -- Starts almost sour, building to a yeasty roasted maltiness, followed by notes of bittersweet chocolate, herbal hops, and figs. Semi-dry finish. The oats are there, but not center stage.   F -- Nice medium body. Slightly bitter/astringent aftertaste.   O -- A canonical example of the classic British stout. Worth the money as a novelty, if for no other reason.    85/100

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Sight: Poured a dark brown/black with a thick tan foam that dissipated fairly quickly, though the head quickly returns upon agitation. A transparent dark brown with a deep ruby core that turns orange at the rim.     Nose: Lots of fruity esters to start, plum, almost prune, blackberry jam. Leads into chocolate malt, lots of graham with some light roasted coffee or milky coffee. Maybe s'mores with some blackberry jam.    Mouthfeel: Medium+ body with a bit of sweetness. Creamy on the tough with a fine but low carbonation. The beer finishes with a touch of alcohol and some roasted malt astringency inviting a following sip.    Flavor: Chocolate, coffee, earthy and toasty notes all balance with cooked and dried fruit notes. Blackberries, plums, fig with a touch of baking spice.     A very full bodied, creamy, smooth and crisp oatmeal stout with just enough sweetness and plenty of balancing hop and malt bitterness. A very food friendly beer that represents the style well and shows the beauty of water in brewing. A pleasure to sip on during the winter.

Sweet chocolate nose, light roast, some oat. A great smell.     Taste is similar. Light on the roast, a sweet smooth character, some cream.    Smooth mouth, a little dry on the finish.    Sam Smith have been doing this long enough, they might as well be good at it. This is a good sweet stout.

Lots of fruity aromas coming from this beer and not a ton of coffee or roasted malts that I enjoy in my darker beers. The beer taste is similar. It has the oat flavor but nothing super strong or take home about it. The beer sorta felt a little over processed to me, a little to balanced. The mouthfeel is nice and it is very drinkable. Overall an average beer.

Smells of roasted malts, coffee and a very mild fruit like sweetness. Tastes of rich, dark roasted malts, dark fruits, coffee, and a hint of caramel. Full bodied, well carbonated for the style, rich and creamy mouth feel.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 From a bottle, pours as a clear dark brown with a beige head. The surprisingly scant aroma of perhaps malt belies the seeming richness of the deep color. Flavors are moderated by oats, but not in a good way. Rather than a smoothed blend of malts and hops, instead they are a muddled mishmash. To the upside there are slight chocolate, roast coffee, caramel, and molasses. But overall, disappointing.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Black body, light cream-colored head, webs of lace. Looks thick, despite being 5%. Chocolate, oats and bread, toasty malt, and a bit of stone and minerality display themselves on the nose. Toasted malt, wet bread, stone, and plenty of sweeter milk chocolate comprise the flavor. Medium weight, smooth, calm carbonation. Much thicker, stickier, and more viscous than the alcohol or even the powerful flavors hint it would be- nice.  The stone and soggy bread notes would have been good as nuances, but they came off a bit strong, especially in taste. Apart from that, this was a great beer. Being heavy in feel but only 5%, it satisfies like an imperial stout that you can drink all night.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 I was a little bit disappointed in this beer. It came out of the bottle a dark brown with a dark brown head. While smelling it I get a lot of Carmel notes with no roasted malt. The taste is about the same with maybe a very subtle roastiness to it in the after taste. Slight fruitiness. The mouthfeel is very creamy which is what I would expect from a oatmeal stout. Overall I wish this beer had a little bit more roastiness and milk choclate taste than the predominant caramel. The mouthfeel is very good which what I would like to duplicate in my own oatmeal stout.

Left a bit of a coating on the tongue, which I don't enjoy, but no bitter aftertaste, which I did.

Aroma has mostly roast, but a smoothness tempered with oats and mild sweetness from just ripe dark fruit notes.    Taste is so good, smooth, roasted malt but not bitter or acrid, the oats in there do their magic, low abv helps the mouthfeel come of silkier. Not overly thick, one of the thinner stouts. Underpinnings of toffee. Earthy creaminess to it.     While oats are an 'adjunct' this is a nice trip down memory lane before all the highly rated stouts were enveloped with vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, maple etc. . .

Super creamy and velvety, very fluffy. That said, it is on the thin side.   Overall Impression: Thinner than I expected, but smooth and tasty none-the-less

It has a chocolate bittersweet taste but remains quite dry. The coffee is there but light and meet subtle nuts. A rich but not overwhelming beer. A perfect session beer.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.75 Smells like sweet dark fruit. Taste is a little sweeter, balanced, and less harsh than the American stouts/porters I've been drinking a lot of lately. The taste reminds me of chocolate, with some faint dark roasted coffee and caramel-esque notes. There is also something else in the background that tastes a little metallic or minerally to me perhaps? Just a little bit of bitterness. I only really detect oatmeal character when I slurp up the head. As with other British beers, this seems to get even better to me as it warms up a bit. Me and this beer go way back, one of the first stouts I tried that I actually liked.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Appearance: A mix of really dark cola brown mixed with a hint of black cherry. A creamy tan head is moderate with medium sized bubbles and a moderate-fast attenuation leaving little to no lacing.    Aromatics: Sweet and fruity with a light scent of the oat, and subtle toasty caramel notes.    Taste: The aroma before the sip really helps accentuate the oat flavour profile, this is followed by a strong coffee/dark chocolate bitter. The finish is a relatively mild bitter, slightly dry and doesn't linger too long.    Feel: The carbonation reminds me of a slightly subdued soda, and the liquid itself is smooth and creamy - almost like lightly carbonated chocolate milk.    Overall: Stouts are probably my favorite style, and this being my first oatmeal stout it was a nice change from the coffee stouts and I usually pick up. I liked its stout creaminess and the sweet oaty nose, not sure about the finish - a little too abrupt for me, I like a mouthfeel that carries on a bit. But overall, I will probably add this one as a regular purchase for my stout shelf, Samuel Smith never seems to disappoint me.

I can’t recall too many stouts or porters in general that I’ve liked more. It is a dark brown almost black with a nice, tan head. It is exceedingly creamy with a bold oatmeal flavor that really takes over immediately. Molasses and a very slight chocolate flavor are also present. This is sweeter than most oatmeal stouts I’ve tried, but not as sweet as many of the chocolate stouts. It has a very nice balance. Like most good stouts it is a meal in a glass. There is nothing revolutionary here, but just what you would expect from an expertly made oatmeal stout. There is definitely a reason this beer is so well rated.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 4 Look: Dark brown, nearly black. Slight mahogany tint when held against light. Lots of carbonation bubbles. Medium sized head, creamy and tan colored. Dissipates quickly with minimal lacing.    Smell: Sweet malts, syrup, oats, light chocolates and faint fruit (cherries)    Taste: Sweet and smooth up front. Followed by dark chocolate and coffee. Finish is mildly bitter with a slight alcohol bite.    Feel: Slightly milky and creamy. Medium carbonation, although pretty high for a stout in my opinion.    Overall: Nice and balanced beer. A little too light & too carbonated for a stout.  This was a really good beer and would buy again, though I was slightly disappointed based on the high rating.

About a finger of tan creamy head that slowly settles down to a thick layer on top. Leaves some very nice lacing down the glass.  AROMA: Swirl the glass and I get a bit of rum raisin or molasses, chocolate, lots of malt character and that familiar British hop dirt smell.   TASTE: Nice bit of chocolate, I think the hops give it a nice tangy quality... dirt and jam/red wine, is what comes to mind in a good way. Nice mildly roasted malt flavor.  FEEL: Mild carbonation, medium thinnish body, slightly creamy but drying on finish.  OVERALL: Very pleasant stout, low abv, so, sessionable.

The only problem I have with this style of beer is their tendency to have a lot of complexities and richness that doesn't allow for truly easy drinking, but that relationship is give and take.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 This is definitely one of the richest tasting beers I've had, which is surprising considering its near-sessionable ABV. The palate is bold and intense with malt and roastiness, though neither really overpowers the other (it is very well balanced!) and the mouthfeel is as full as it's flavor profile. Definitely the standard to which all other oatmeal stouts should aspire.

S- Lots of roasted malts, coffee.    T- Pretty sweet, but extremely smooth. Follows the nose with lots of roasted malts and coffee flavors, with some light chocolate flavors as well.    F- Very watery body, but smooth. Little to medium carbonation.    O- If you want a light stout for a great price that's easy to drink, this is certainly an excellent option. That said, I was a bit let down by this beer, considering how much others I know like it. I think it may just be that I've become spoiled by high ABV imperial stouts though, because this is one of the best 5% and under beers that I've had.   
look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 I am a beer vendor and the receiving woman at one of my old stores and her husband adore this beer. She asked me if I could bring it into her store but we were out of stock at our warehouse. So I found a 4pk at another account and brought it to her, she was over the moon about this beer. Normally I would not drink many stouts. I ended up finding another 4pk and had to buy it to try it and give her and her husband each a beer out of the pack. I've never open a beer in my car but I had to see what the fuss was all about so the second I got out of the store I popped one open. In the bottle it seemed a little to carbonated but it tasted really really... Normal not like a coffee or chocolate stout, this shocked me. So I get home and pour it into a pint glass and was absolutely shocked at how dark the beer was because having first tried it in the bottle it didn't taste burnt or really stout like other very dark beers. After pouring it into the pint glass the over carbonation went away and the beautiful tan head laced the glass ever so slightly. It is a wonderful dark beer that will surprise you. This is my first ever beer review. In conclusion this is a dark oatmeal stout that has a balance between flavors that is unprecedented

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Appearance: This stout pours surprisingly dark which makes it seem like a really thick beer. It does have a fairly thick and foamy tan/cream colored head which makes the beer more appealing.     Smell: This beer has very distinct nutty aromas. The nutty aroma is intimidating at first but does become more appetizing after you start to smell the coffee and chocolate notes. Overall, this stout has some distinct roasty, malty notes throughout.     Taste: Although sweeter than expected, it does have some bitter chocolate notes. The taste is fairly nutty with some hints of toffee and oats. I would describe this beer to be very roasty with burnt malts, chocolate, and some less distinct notes of licorice. In comparison to other dark beers like Guinness, it is sweeter and has a more "chocolate nutty" taste.     Mouthfeel: Has a very smooth, silky feel when you drink it and is a fairly easy-to-drink beer. It does not seem to have as much carbonation in comparison to most other beers (in my opinion), so in that sense it adds to the silkiness of the beer. Contrary to its appearance, the beer feels fairly thin.    Overall, it is a decent beer that I would recommend to others. I appreciate that an oatmeal stout stays true to its name and does in fact taste oaty and nutty. However, it is a hard beer to get used to because of its sheer complexity. It does however have a perfect balance of sweet and bitter and isn't too overwhelming for first time oatmeal stout drinkers.

I was not as impressed with this stout as I wanted to be, I was looking for their to be more of a maple, oats (aka "oatmeal") taste to it!

Nose of leathery licorice, some mildly bitter and roasted coffee beans. Taste is more nutty and rich, some oats, and some roasted warmth but no bitterness. Fairly earthy and just a little sweet. Good stuff. Very smooth rich mouthful, but the body is on the lighter side. Finish is fairly uneventful...kind of smooth and continuous.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Wow, a bit let down with this as I was sure it would be great. Reviews seem to support it too but I just think it pales in comparison to their organic chocolate stout and nut brown ale which are favs.     L: Pours the deepest darkest brown with a beautiful 2 finger head if poured correctly. As the head recedes there is some beautiful lacing. It really clings.     S: First sign I might not be a fan of this one. Malt of course but also light scents of leather, oatmeal and bread.     T: Drinkable but not what I thought it would be. Almost a generic taste. Very smooth but hmmm.... just nothing special about it. What am I missing? This is a 94 on BA? Taste matches smell almost to a T. A touch of rubber bike tire inner tube air. A touch of carbon paper, maybe Moxie. Damn I want to like this.. :(    F: Feel is typical Samuel Smith. Smooth drinking with a slight bit of overcarb which gives it a zing on the tongue. Not as good as their other beers I have tasted though. Probably because there is little sweetness to push back on the zing.     Overall I am not a hater but wouldn't buy this again. I was sure it was going to be special. To me the organic chocolate stout is light years ahead of this. Maybe I just like sweet stouts. This is like a base stout that has not had it's flavor added yet. Might be me, probably is.

Smell: It has a roasted aroma that is complimented with a mild coffee aroma. There are also hints of butter and vague hints of fruit.     Taste: The roasted malt flavors are prominent with the coffee in the background. There are hints of butter in the flavors. There is moderate bitterness. The flavors of oats is a secondary flavor that comes forward as the beer warms.     Feel: It has a medium creamy texture with moderate bitterness on the palate.    Overall: It is a beer that is moderately creamy that highlights the balance between roasted malts and the oats with hints of butter and fruits in a quality flavor harmony.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Coffee and licorice in the aroma. Herbal perfumey hops. Toasted bread and some baking spices. Chocolate teddy grahams, maybe?     Pours nearly black with a creamy light tan head. Good retention with decent lacing.    Rich complex malt character with dark roasted grains upfront followed with fresh biscuits and oatmeal cookies. Some dark fruits. Prunes and licorice. Snappy hop bitterness, slightly fruity and herbal balancing the slightly sweet finish. Graham cracker crust and cocoa. A touch of raspberry.    Silky medium high body with low carbonation. Slick, almost oily, but not chewy. Long slightly sweet finish.    Complex grainy malt character with balancing roasty bitterness. A lot going on in 5%.

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Quite simply my favorite beer. I have had many "favorites" over the years, but I keep coming back to this one. Many of the reviews have gone into detail about the taste, feel, and look of the beer so I will not elaborate too much else about it. I will describe it as a 50%, or maybe less, Guinness Stout with a semi-sweet, delightfully creamy blend added to it. Not too subtle and not in your face flavors. Just perfect for me. It can be simply a treat or even a session beer for myself. I just enjoy this beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Writing this as I drink it...    Poured a 355ml bottle into a 350ml beer glass.    Poured a very dark reddish brown with a good but fairly loose light brown head. Head retention good. Lots of lacing.    Good nose with chocolate, coffee, oats, malt, some cola, licorice and stone fruit.    Palate is very expressive and complex. Roasted - burnt malts, chocolate, coffee, toffee, licorice, dark stone fruit.    Mouth is also very god. Full in the mouth and beautifully balanced.    I'm not a huge fan of stouts but this blew me away. Very complex, well balanced, great mouth-feel, nice head, good lacing and even a beautiful label/bottle. Superb!    Everyone should try this beer not just fans of the style.    Highly recommended.

A little bit of soapy looking bubbles in the head. Smells of coffee and cream with slight dark chocolate notes. Some English yeast esters seem evident. No hops in aroma. Tastes semi-sweet with some dark roasts and a bit of an earthy & nutty character. Medium high bitterness helps even out the mostly sweet character. Feels velvety and smooth just like a dark chocolate milkshake. The oatmeal simply give this beer a great mouthfeel. Overall, an excellent brewed beer and a hallmark of the Oatmeal Stout category. I really dig this, just feels like it's missing a little oomph character to really make me a huge fan of this.

Pours nearly black with pretty cherry highlights when held to the light with half a finger of creamy mocha head that leaves rocky foothills lace as it slowly recedes.    Smells of chocolate ice cream, creamy coffee, dark berry jam, faint burnt sugar and black licorice.    Tastes follows nose, but not as sweet as I was expecting. More chocolate ice cream and coffee, toasted caramel, dark berries and sweet black licorice.    Feels firm and smooth. Medium bodied with solid, creamy carbonation. Finishes off-sweet.    Verdict: Vigorously recommended. It's like drinking a milkshake.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Appearance is quite dark. Holding to the light, I can see just a small amount of a sheen through the glass. The head after being poured was about 2 1/2 fingers of a light shade of almond.    The aroma was very pleasant and sweet. I could sense chocolate, and coffee.    The taste has a lot going on. My first sip seemed to have a bit of a unique flavor on the front. I wasn't sure at first if it was supposed to be like that, and to me, it seemed very familiar. The back had a lot of chocolate, coffee, a little almond, and than it hit me. The unique flavor (which is subtle) was similar to well water. I read the bottle and found that its brewed with...you guessed it; well water. Keep in mind, its not overpowering, and in fact, my wife couldn't taste it. But growing up drinking well water, the taste is unmistakable; not in a bad way. In fact, I think it enhances all the flavors naturally. Very, very, tasty, and would say this was a great way to end an evening.    It feels very milky and smooth.     Overall I certainly enjoyed this one. I look forward to many more in the near future!

Enough hops that they aren't prominent, but keep the sweetness in check and superbly balanced for a stout.

Look: If you've ever seen a Guinness, you've seen this beer. Dark with a dense head that doesn't fade quickly.    Smell: Malt, coffee, and cream.    Taste: Exactly the same as the smell. I found it alarmingly similar to Guinness, only slightly better. Can't put my finger on it, but there's also something in the background mainly serving to enhance the main flavors.    Feel: Creamy goodness. Not a lot else to say about it, even the head was creamy. It felt like the beer had been topped with whipped cream.    Overall: I was very impressed by this beer. It ticks every box for an enjoyable stout, but lacks the "wow" factor to put it over the top. I would definitely return to it again though.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Very dark brown. Not quite opaque. Pillowy, chunky head retains well and is a medium shade of brown. Smells only minimally roasty, with molasses, dark berry and bready notes. Much more roasty on the palate. Notes of dark chocolate, even the tartness to it reminds me more of cocoa or coffee than fruit. More molasses and berries can be teased out as beer is sloshed around the mouth. Finish is smoky, roasty, somewhat bitter, influenced by whatever small amount of classic English hops were put in this. Neither dry nor cloying, and not overly astringent, in spite of smoke, tart, and bitterness. Body is medium, perhaps a bit thin. In any case, it's an easy drinker. Carbonation is spritzy but so very fine, not conflicting with the velvety texture of the liquid.

Did not see a date on the bottle, but I'm probably blind.     I noticed malted barley,chocolate, coffee.    Low carbonation. Smooth, silky, creamy mouth feel.    I do like stouts/oatmeal stouts and this one did not disappoint. Still have 3 left waiting   for me, and this is a good thing.

T: 4 Fortunately, the flavors make up for the aroma. Much more malt presence with nice licorice, chocolate, and coffee qualities backed up by English yeast. Moderate sweetness and a slightly bitter, mineral quality to the finish.    M: 4.25 Pretty thin but good carbonation and very drinkable.    O: 4 Solid beer, but nothing too interesting going on. The aromas are a bit off, but flavors are fine, if a bit one-note.

Great 1-2 finger tan moderate head that resolves in ring and lots of lace.     S: Smooth roasted malts, bitter, dark chocolate. plus a creamy oat-like aroma ends with a bit of molasses/caramel.    T: Best part. Follows smell - smooth roasted malts, bitter, dark chocolate. plus a creamy oat-like aroma ends with a bit of molasses/caramel - plus dark fruits, roasted malt character, oats, and becomes more interesting. Finishes too sweet for me, but good.     M: medium mouthfeel with prickly carbonation embolden the sweetness more than the bitter. After dinner beer! But will also be great with pasta bolognese.     O: Must try. Try 6.

It has that trademark earthy mineral english flavor that find in the Taddy Porter and the Fullers London Porter. Less tangy and somewhat more roasted, malty, and smooth than the Taddy Porter.

The feel also seems to be a bit more thin and syrupy than I recall. Still, a strong offering that hearkens back to a time when I didn't much know what a fancy beer was!

A creamy taste (from the oatmeal?), which mixes well with the darker, more bitter flavors. A meal of a beer that gets easier to drink as it approaches room temperature.

Not getting much smell except for a bit of familiar Samuel Smith's funkiness (perhaps from the well water they use) which I recognize from their other beers. Taste is just excellent. Absolutely delicious. Nothing too overstated, no big explosion of flavors here, but a perfect balance of chocolaty, caramel-y, oatmeal-y, malty goodness with a bit of hop bitterness. Getting a little bit of licorice and currant. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Very tasty.

Smells of caramel, chocolate, coffee, oatmeal, coffee, and fruity English yeast esters. Flavor follows the smell with added oatmeal cream in the medium-ish mouthfeel. This is one of the first stouts that wasn't Guinness (along w/ their Imperial) that I ever drank back when I was technically underage many moons ago. I will always be somewhat partial, as it brings back many memories. Great true to style English Oatmeal Stout. Never liked the clear bottles though after I learned what a light struck beer can taste like later on in life.

Flavor is rich and warm, excellent overall.    Definitely a decent body here but not overly viscous. Still relatively light on the palate.     Overall a really great beer.

Poured from the bottle into a Spiegelau stout glass, this beer's head is three fingers thick and eggshell brown, with solid lacing, and VERY dark brown body.    The smell contains not as bold of characteristics with most other stouts. I think I can even pick up on the oatmeal.    This taste is again, very mild for a stout. It's certainly not light...at all. I still taste caramelized malts. Perhaps the normally noticeable coffee and chocolate notes are being tamed by the oatmeal.    The mouthfeel I'm getting here is smooth and crisp.    Overall, I'll give Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout - Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster) a 4.5. I could see a person reluctant of stouts giving this a try and enjoying it for being so mild.

The oatmeal in this gem doesn't come until after the sip, slight burnt flavors of popped rice and barley following a long, roasty complex consisting of mostly smoky tannins. Tart on the mouth--not a heavy stout, but solid and crisp. Very drinkable--only the brits know how to do a good stout, I feel.

The smell is sweet/roasted/smoky, very complex but not strong. I got a lot of roasted vanilla/toffee from the first sip, with a hint of raw chocolate on the end. It is not the thickest stout I have had, but it definitely lingers on the palate for awhile. Overall, it's one if the best, most drinkable stouts I have had.

Let’s be honest here: beer brewing goes way back to Britain centuries ago so they know what they are doing.     Look-It pours a deep black tuxedo of desire and beauty. The head comes in full and remains thick and creamy all the way down encrusting the glass in a sticky layer of dark colored lacing.     Smell-It smells of coffee beans and chocolate chips as well as a bready malt backbone that mixes together to serve up a strong aroma of desserts. Well, desserts for adults, because this brew has a solid 5.0% ABV.     Taste-It tastes like how the nose indicated HOWEVER it has a severely pleasant smoky taste on top of those notes.     Mouthfeel-It feels rich, creamy, and full. It is as silky smooth as the inner thighs of a freshly deflowered virgin. It is a full-bodied stout that is as rich as melted butter mixed with unicorn’s saliva.     Overall-This brew was as good as my brother said it was. Additionally, the ancient recipe of this variety and the high standards by which it is made makes it that much more delicious and admirable. I should say that this beer is better than Guinness.

A good beer to tie one on with, but also is well rounded enough for your one nightly.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours jet black with 1/2 inch of khaki colored head.    Aroma is of very pungent roasted malt. I get present toffee notes, oats, and even a slight alcohol kick.    Taste isn't my style. Very light and heavily carbonated. I like big rich stouts,but for such a low abv, the beer isn't bad. This beer is big on heavily roasted malts and oatmeal. The light carbonation and slight hop flavor leaves an almost citrusy flavor that doesn't meld quite right with the other flavors.     Overall, good beer for the low abv, but not my style. Also maybe a tad bit too carbonated for me, especially for the style. I see it pairing well with a couple of chocolate chip cookies or oatmeal raisin cookies. It gets a 78.5/100.

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 4 550ml bottle into a Tulip. Paid £2.90 for a single bottle.    Pours an opaque, dark, inky black body with a slight ruby tinge that remains unchanged when held to the light. A two-finger in height, frothy, mocha coloured head reduces quickly to a thin cap, leaving behind small amounts of thick, sticky lacing.    The nose is light overall. Mild roasted malts, light brown sugar and earthy yeast are the most noticeable aromas with a touch of coffee and dark stone fruit in the background. The taste leads with lightly roasted malts and brown sugar sweetness before giving way to ripe, fleshy, dark stone fruit. A gentle roasted bitterness gradually builds from the mid-palate onwards and is joined towards the end with dark chocolate, sharp coffee bean, earthy yeast, as well as hard water and stone minerals to give a slightly dry, bittersweet finish. In the mouth, superbly fine carbonation and the noticeable addition of oatmeal give a silky smooth and creamy texture, but the medium body is a little lacking in weight and heft for the style.    Overall this is a very good beer, the mineral qualities from the stone fermentation process add a genuinely unique and interesting character but ultimately, the smell, taste and feel are all a little too light and delicate for my tastes. The relatively low ABV% and huge drinkability however make it an excellent choice as a session beer or a great accompaniment to a hearty meal, for these purposes I would certainly recommend it.

Scents of toffee and molasses. Taste is of caramel, English toffee, and maple. Very reminiscent of the old Werther's candies. Smooth and easy to drink.    This is the baseline for the style, and a timeless one at that. Be sure to experience this one.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Aroma: Alcohol sweetness jumps straight out in front. Moderate oatmeal and raisin bran. Smells a lot like a highly alcoholic oatmeal raisin cookie.    Appearance: Opaque black, no light getting through this one. Low, dense tan had that persists.    Flavor: Rich and full roastiness without being bitter. Tastes much like it smells, with a lot of oatmeal, dark bread crust, moderately raisiny. Finishes quite dry with a lingering alcohol sweetness.    Mouthfeel: Big, thick body with low carbonation.    Overall Impression: The aroma is pretty startling at first. The alcohol smell detracts and overwhelms a lot of the malt character going on. It is absolutely delicious. I can't shake the feeling that it tastes like an oatmeal cookie soaked in rich alcohol. Very pleasant and complex. Would make a great dessert.

Great head retention with lacing very present; leaves a thick, frothy ring around the entire glass.    S - Sweet, roasted aroma hits you up front that slowly dissipates into an equally as sweet chocolate and oatmeal aroma. Very subdued note of coffee beans present as well. Simplistic yet incredible.     T - Not what I was hoping for with the look and smell. Little hops (appropriate to style). Mild burnt coffee, a hint of chocolate.    M - Light to medium body. Nice texture, good carbonation compared to most stouts.    O - Good surprise. Was sitting in the back of friends refrigerator at a fantasy draft. Not a bad stout.

The aroma is light and clean, with a dry combination of oats, minerals, and lightly roasted grain. The roasted grains are present in the flavor as well, along with notes of bittersweet chocolate and dry toast. The mouthfeel is light but not watery. Overall, this one is rich and malty without being heavy.

Great head retention with lacing very present; leaves a thick, frothy ring around the entire glass.    S - A beautiful aroma radiates from the beer. Dominantly sweet with no hints of bitterness present. A very sweet, roasted aroma hits you up front that slowly dissipates into an equally as sweet chocolate and oatmeal (shocking I know) aroma. Very subdued note of coffee beans present as well. Simplistic yet incredible.     T - I had been hoping for a little bit more here; I think it might just be my personal tastes but every oatmeal stout I've had never lived up to what I expected. Very good taste overall though, I did enjoy it though, like before, was expecting something else. Roasted malts and coffee notes up front, followed quickly by the oatmeal flavorings. The beer finishes with a hint of brown sugar that leaves a lingering aftertaste.     M - Wow! Aside from not being a heavy or full bodied beer, the mouthfeel is nearly perfect. Medium bodied though feels a little lighter on the back-end. Very smooth and silky feeling beer with each sip with an optimal amount of carbonation that doesn't assault the mouth.    O - An amazing beer overall with a spectacular feel though the taste didn't live up to what I had expected and hoped for. The beer would be very fitting for the winter I feel like.

T: Dark malts, roast, coffee, oat creaminess, cola, faint fruit. A light grainy astringency and mild hop bitterness balance the light sweetness from the malt.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.5 At 50°F poured into a clean Nonic Pint glass, palate and nose cleansed.    Appearance: This pours Black but when held eye level there is natural light penetration presenting a Darker Browner tint. There is an index finger of “glittering”, foamy head which dissipates quickly leaving no lacing.    Smell: Initially the nose presents, to me, the usual ancient well water smell followed by roasty, bready malt and as it warms the other usual characteristics of a stout present itself, mainly the cocoa.    Taste: The taste is concurrent with the smell, that of bread, oats and a nice cocoa finish.    Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with a slight crisp, drier feel to it at the back of the throat.    Overall: The balance of the stout flavors and oats are excellent. As a novice I have grown to really appreciate the basic styles brewed right. Samuel Smith’s, as a brewery, is one of my anchors when I become fatigued with the complex experimentations of others. While my only critique is the lack of viscous mouthfeel of their stouts I have learned how to appreciate it. This is another great offering from Sam Smith which I will keep in my regular rotation throughout the year.

Smell: At first I picked out roasted malt, a bit of coffee and cocoa with oatmeal. On second sniff I picked out dark cherries and other dark fruits with a very faint hint of the alcohol.    Taste: Coffee, Bittersweet chocolate and roasted malts on the taste. Slight hint of the dark fruit to back it up. I also can pick out the oatmeal in the taste.    Feel: Nice and creamy but a little bit watery for my liking. I wish it had a bit of a thicker mouth feel for an oatmeal stout but I have to remember it is only 5% ABV and not a RIS. The wateriness does not take away from the experience of the beer.     Overall: I like this oatmeal stout very much. It is a sessionable brew with nice flavors to match the nose. My only gripe is the thinner mouth feel. I recommend this to anyone who likes stouts/oatmeal stouts.

I consider this to be the standard against which I measure all other stouts. I suppose that should make it a perfect 5, but I think each individual characteristic could actually be improved upon. The head could be a little bigger or the smell could be a little more dynamic. Taken as a whole however, everything comes together perfectly.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 5 Not only am I about to consume an Oatmeal Stout for your reading (and my tasting) pleasure but this is none other than Samuel Smith's much celebrated and widely known in all the counties of England and further ashore including Ireland, the Isle of Man and Jersey Islands invigorating, energising and revitalising Oatmeal Stout†. Or something along those lines - the label did look like it had been designed in the 1850’s. And you know what? Frugality like that (i.e. not paying for rebranding in over a hundred years) is rare these days and Samuel Smith has it in spades, cheers Mr. Smith!    Poured from a 550ml bottle into a nonic pint.    A: Well I accidentally hard poured a khaki head of 2 inches... looks good though with its deep dark cola body. Can’t wait to dive in... yep *taps fingers*. 8/10.    S: Espresso coffee notes mingle with hints of dark fruit and a melange of roasted barley and rolled oats... possibly the most porridge-like beer my nose has inhaled. I like it when my Oatmeal Stouts have oat aromas, like a big glass of breakfast! 8/10.    T: Damn tasty. More on the dark fruit side than coffee/chocolate with those oats really coming in to play with flavour and body. They (the oats) take on dry/tannic qualities towards the finish and there is an amalgamation of bitter/dry/sour/sweet characters that really make this fine Stout shine. Did I mention this is ‘damn tasty’? Oh... right... well this is Stouts finest hour. 9/10.    M: Medium bodied with a fairly lively carbonation. Oats = Chewy. 8/10.    D: Again I’m a big fan of the Samuel Smith’s ales, they’ve all so far been like getting inside a time machine and going back to the 19th century where men were men and women were men too (everyone was a bit hardier back then overall). If you want a real damn tasty and luxurious Stout then look no further. 10/10.    Food match: Back in 1852 when you had to work 16 hrs a day you would generally eat gruel and drink 18 pints of Stout, people wore hats that contained small anvils to help strengthen their neck muscles. Today however beef stew is a better option.    †Thesaurus Nazis will have noted that the three words ‘invigorating’, ‘energising’ and ‘revitalising’ all mean the same thing, congratulations‡. *slow clap*    ‡Syntax Nazis will have noted that I used the ‘dagger’ character BEFORE and instead of the ‘asterisk’ character for my footnote, congratulations. *slow clap*   
look: 3.5 | smell: 2 | taste: 2 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 2.75 Look: pours like a standard stout. Dark almost opaque with about a finger of head (gentle pour) that dissipates quickly.    Aroma: Not much there. Some roasted notes from the dark malts and dark chocolate. Not much fruit for me. Alcohol is present.    Taste: Again, not much there. Little hops (appropriate to style). Mild burnt coffee, a hint of chocolate. I find myself searching for more but unable to find the depth of a great stout. Some alcohol on the finish but not in a pleasant way.    Mouthfeel: Creamy and pretty full. The best point in my opinion. I enjoyed the body.    Overall: Disappointed twice now on this stuff. I know it is rated high and everyone has different taste buds. Mine are just not firing here. I would like to have pulled a few more aroma and flavor notes out here. It is one step up from a Guinness extra stout for me but no more. Will not venture to this again.

A quality I always appreciate. Nice and smooth in the mouth as a patty stout should be. It's a great beer. In my top 5 stouts.

Fantastic beer, best oatmeal stout I've ever had the pleasure of trying.

Sounds like Rice Crispy ceral in a glass. Smells of oats, chocolate, and sweet hints of alcohol. Heavy weight, as a stout should be. Taste is oats, coffee, and bitter chocolate. Bit of a dry finish with oats and a slight alcohol aftertaste. Suprisingly boozy taste for only 5%.    I suppose this is the difference between an English and American stout, but this beer didn't have a whole lot of flavor for what it was. Tasted a bit thin and lacking, but still good. I think I'll stick to Imperial stouts and leave this one for the traditionalists.

Pretty straight forward smell of grains and malts. Not much chocolate or coffee. Same with taste. Smooth, minimal bitterness. Mouth feel is between thin and medium. Overall I would describe the taste as good but nondescript. I would not drink it just to drink a beer--I'd reach for the organic chocolate or imperial stout. But with a meal I would drink this over those. Bottom line, Samuel Smith continues to impress me with its lineup.

Today I chose to give the old Oatmeal Stout a proper review. The beer pours with a giant, frothy cappuccino colored head, a full 2 fingers over the top of the glass. Picturesque! Like a root beer float. The awesome staying power of the head lingers over a deep black liquid with slight transparency and cherry accents. A distinct but mellow browned butter aroma greets the nose. Along with hints of raisin, smoke and minerals. The flavor is of mildly sweet butterscotch with subtle sour bitterness. Lime-like spiciness meets a roasted character with an herbal tobacco taste in the finish. It's a nice marriage of flavors, but the bitterness, though not excessive, still manages to overpower the malts a little. The brew is medium-bodied with adequate carbonation. Unremarkable, but suitable for the style I suppose. Overall, this is a staple for a reason. There's quite a bit of character packed in to this tame ABV offering from the English legend. If you've never tried it, it's a must have on any beer-tasting checklist.

After having Founder's Breakfast Stout, I've been on the lookout for this brew and was fortunate that my local craft beer store had it in stock.     Pours a dark brown body with a huge, fluffy tan head. Great lacing! Lots of oats and nuts in the nose, with cleaner in the background. Upon first taste, nothing other is oatmeal is present, but quickly the dark and roasted malts assert themselves. Sweet milk chocolate shows up towards then end to round out the flavor profile. Nice touch. Feels smooth, carbonated and very, very drinkable. Definitely lighter than I expected with almost zero bite. Overall, this oatmeal stout is much simpler than other American stouts (lower ABV, no syrupy qualities, or caramel notes), and therefore, can be critiqued for being a bit two-dimensional, but maybe I'm biased. Nevertheless, this is an oatmeal stout for anyone interested in getting into stouts. Worth every penny.
