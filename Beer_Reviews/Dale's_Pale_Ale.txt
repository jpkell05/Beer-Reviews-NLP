look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 12 oz can poured into pint glass.  Amber in appearance, soft white head, long lasting.  Smells of caramel, wood, pine resin, biscuit and a touch of yeast.  Tastes of caramel, cedar, pine resin, biscuit, lemon-orange.  Medium body, smooth, solid mid-section, clean finish.  Overall, very well balanced (hops, malt, yeast contributions), flavorful beer. I had not had a Dale's in over 5 years. I assumed it would not stand up to all the new beers; on the contrary, it stands out more than ever - for its evenhanded, pleasing complexity. A beer for all occasions.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Really a nice overall beer.     Poured from a can into a tulip glass. Slightly cloudy golden yellow color with a nice foamy head and good lacing. Nice citrus and pine smell. Some lemon, honey, and pine taste. Pleasant amount of bitterness. Not wait long to have again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Appearance: Really pretty looking beer. An aggressive pour gets you a thick frothy head you see in the picture. Crystal clear burnt orange color.     Smell: Aroma is malty with some light piney notes. I feel like I should get more from the nose, but its just not there. Its simple, mild and straightforward    Taste: The taste is where this one really shines - You get that old school prominent malty flavor with notes of grapefruit, orange and pine. Its a classic and the profile is right on. Its a pale ale, so nothing is too strong, but it avoids the pitfalls of other pale ales and is never watery or weak.     Feel: Easy drinking, not overly bitter, and even somewhat refreshing.    Overall a very good pale ale, classic in profile and one I'd happily revisit.

Clear light orange amber with rising bubbles.  Mild smell of bready yeast and floral hops.  The taste begins semi-dry with above average spicy hop bitterness and a grassy tang.  Caramel malt controls the middle with an apple cider fizz from abundant CO2.  Dryness and bitterness are highest at the finish with a long lingering hoppy aftertaste.  Medium body, above average carbonation. Smooth rich feel.  Label says "Mountain Pale Ale", its big alright, lots of malt and IPA level hops.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Ain't that unusual, this beer, not yet reviewed, literally consumed about 100 times. What struck me early on as these guys were leading the way with the canning of craft beer, was how similar this beer was to SNPA. The color is a slight SRM shade lighter, but ultimately it comes in that dark gold to light amber. Great clarity, solid 3/5" white head. The aroma is a lot of those old school Cascade hop tree and grapefruit feels.     Taste, yeah man, that old school bitterness, aspirin, pine, grapefruit. Slight caramel malt underpinnings hold things together and give it that comfort food vibe like the heartiness of a sturdier, maltier pale ale of yesteryear. This is one of those beers that deserves to be in the Hall of Fame beer wise. Its been around, led the can format, available, affordable, consistent.     It also fits into almost any scenario. On the beach? It works. After the slopes? It works. Tacos? It works. This beer is the bad ass dude wearing the WWII hat at the VFW.

The nose is piney bitter with a caramel sweetness that comes in to keep it in check. Simple yet aromatic.    Quite bitter but still held down by the caramel sweetness. In a good way. This one is a straight shooter. Quality piney hops up font for that fix. Simple caramel malts for that balance. Just plain delicious.     Mouthfeel is medium bodied and damn smooth. Carbonation is soft to medium with a sort of fizzy feeling towards the end.

Very easy-drinking pale ale, very balanced taste, though a bit muted when compared to some of the other ale offerings out there. I found it to be a very enjoyable brew with a somewhat light finish that had almost a perfect amount of hops burn mixed with a nice citrus that sat very well on my plate. Love it!

Smooth mild mouthfeel with good carbonation. Just the right amount of bitter aftertaste.

Not getting too much sweetness which is nice. Smells like an IPA but i do expect that with most American Pale Ales. Smells fresh and vibrant.  Taste is just wow - very complex, getting a strong hop presence for sure, pick up the grapefruit and pine, also getting a backbone of malt and some sweetness to balance. In a blind taste test, I would have said this is an IPA cause it does have bitterness. Not super drinkable compared to most American beers but very, very tasty!  Overall, worth the price...Have to give this a solid grade of A

Smell doesn’t give much away, some pine present. Taste isn’t as hoppy as some other brews eg. Lost Coast or Twisted Manzanita. More on par with Sierra Nevada. Good amount of bitterness- it’s what I like most about this beer. Very light carbonation, a little too light imho. Overall a good choice for the price and relatively high abv will add to your enjoyment.

Dark amber color with a decent head and lacing. Very strong pine aromas, which, as trite as it may sound, seem straight out of Colorado. Tasted a bit of those pine hops, but the malts are just as present if not more--a deep sweetness as though there were a dark chocolate equivalent to brown sugar. I don't like the grainy aftertaste. Feel is smooth and body is solid.     As a hophead, I appreciate that you can find this beer at stores otherwise dominated by Bud and Miller Lite (and at a good price). It's like Sierra Nevada in this respect. And I would put Dale's on par with Sierra Nevada overall. Dale's is boozier and stronger, but weighed down by its graininess.

Aroma is primarily grainy & grassy hops with caramel malts. This is old school vs. the fruity, hoppy new school.    Taste brings the caramel malt forward even more with hoppy notes of grains, earthiness, and floral.    Mouthfeel is medium, good carbonation, solid bitterness.    Overall, a solid pale ale that leans more towards a traditional profile of dominant malt with grainy & earthy hops. Has some sweetness, but I wouldn't call it juicy or fruity at all.

S: Caramel malts... resinous piney hops.    T/F: Follows the nose. Malty... more so than expected. Caramel and toasted grains. Solid bitterness... hop profile was pine, herbal, and mild citrus. A little bit of pepper. Medium to light in body. Well carbonated... with more malts and resin at the finish.    O: An old-school classic IPA. Nothing special and maybe a bit dated, but still an easy-drinking quality beer.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 A clear coppery golden color with a creamy head. The aroma is subtle but nice. Mouthfeel is unremarkable. The flavor is smooth and robust, with a mild malty aftertaste.    The cans from my six are just like the photo here on BA except that in the red stripe at the bottom, they say Brevard, North Carolina instead of Lyons, Colorado.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 12 oz can into glass mug. Amber/copper colour with a tan head and some nice lacing. Smells hoppy and citrusy. Taste has a little biscuity malt but mainly slightly bitter malt and citrus rind. Mouthfeel is fine but the bitter hop does linger as an aftertaste. Not the best I've had but certainly not bad. Prost!

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I picked up a 12-pack of cans for $15. Has a nice citrus taste that’s bitter but not overwhelming. It might not be my favorite pale ale. But it’s enjoyable and easy to drink. I’ll definitely buy it again.

Malt up front hops in back supporting the APA designation with an overall very good feel. Everything in balance with an excellent kick but not the alcohol bite. Definitely the Colorado approach vs the MT hopes forward take (IPA) that I am used to and Like. Very nice brew.

look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12 oz can poured into a pint glass.     L - Pours a clear copper color with about an inch of foamy white head that leaves a decent lacing throughout the glass. Not as "pale" as expected.     S - Citrus rind, caramel, and malty with some spice and floral hops.     T - Similar to the smell, starts sweet with biscuit-y malt and caramel, bitter citrus rind, pine, some cereal grain. A nice balanced flavor.     F - Light to medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly sticky from the malty caramel, clean and slightly dry finish.     O - A decent, drinkable pale ale that isn't offensive or overpowering. A nice representation of the style.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours an amber with a white head. Smells of citrus, hops, sweet malt, and some fruits. Tastes of citrus zest, sweet malt, fresh mildly bitter hops, and tropical fruit. Medium in body and carbonation. Overall an incredibly good pale ale.

The taste is bitter and off-putting with a bitter whang that doesn't seem to be hoppiness. Not much hops flavor, just thin and bitter. My second try at this beer...obviously not for me.

The nose is mainly malt along with spices and fruit. Hard to nail down the exact fruit. The taste is well balanced but more hops that remind me of an IPA rather than an APA. The malts do blend well with the hop element. A nice medium body with a fairly clean finish. Overall a good APA.

Flavor is intensely malty but not offensive and easy to drink for the hop shy.

Very refreshing in this God forsaken heat and humidity of Harris county, TX. I'd buy it again.

Two fingers of off-white soapy foam sits upon a nice crystal clear copper body and leaves sticky lace on the glass with every tilt.    The nose is a little weak, consisting of light floral hops, a bit of orange and a malty bread aroma. It drinks crisp with good Hop bitterness front to back and the same malt and hop characteristics that I got in the nose. There is also a slightly sour taste of wood. Feel is light to medium in body with fairly high carbonation.    Middle of the road Pale Ale.

The smell has the hops up front with some light malts coming through once it warms. The taste is mainly sweet becomes slightly bitter once it warms. There is a sticky sweet aftertaste and finish. The palate has a light to medium body and is sessionable. Its carbonated just right. Overall, I’m glad I finally found it and tried it as this is good for its style and good for me.

Crisp bitterness balanced with malty sweetness and the standard pale ale array of tropical fruits with a fair bit of marmalade citrus. Pleasant lingering finish. Don't understand the negative reviews; for my money this is an excellent example of the style and the fact that I can buy it readily in the UK for a very reasonable price (£1.90 in Tesco) makes this a definite regular buy for me. Cheers!

Whatever, this beer is okay, nothing special, SNPA kicks the shit out of this beer and in my opinion that beer has held it's own with the changing of the times, however, this beer is a different story...ehhh.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Nice copper orange look to this beer. Not a ton on the nose with a malty scent with a tinge of citrus hops. Hops a bit more overpowering and bitter than I would have expected. I'd call it slightly astringent. The bready malts come through on the finish. Medium thick mouthfeel with Slightly less than medium carbonation on this brew.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 1.25 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 1.25 Look - Poured a copper/amber color, two fingers of white head, minimal lacing.  Aroma - Tangerine, floral, ethanol.  Taste - Bitter up front, hops lean more towards citrus like the aroma, orange, vegetal note, alcohol is noticeable from start to finish, malt is thin and has a vague sweetness. The aftertaste is soapy, bitter and boozy.  Feel - Light-medium body, watery, ample carbonation.    Overall - I remember trying this a few years back and thinking I got an infected can. I guess not. This tastes exactly the same as it did back then. The solvent-like bitterness with the noticeable alcohol makes this one of the worst beers I've had. It really reminds me of a bad homebrew IPA mixed with paint thinner. A fluke from an otherwise great brewery.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Hazy copper colour with ok head that doesn't stick around for long. No real lacing to speak of.     Flavors are slightly tumultuous; the carbonation is right upfront. There is light grapefruit flavors and light pine resin. Malt is not really present; crystal malts are here along with light alcohol flavor.     Pretty good. Crushable.

Initial taste was of a light bodied pale ale, but then slapped in the face by a very bitter backbone. Similar to several other "west coast" style pale ales I've had. I definitely prefer a maltier profile with more dry-hopped presence without the bitter aftertaste.

Modest pine and a flash of malt in the aroma.    Has an almost AAL taste up front -- strong corn malt and faint floral hops -- but that gives way to some pine flavor; some bready, caramel malts; and a strong hop bitterness in the aftertaste.    Medium bodied with solid carbonation.    Sorry to say it, but I think the craft world has moved far beyond this one. It's not awful, but there are many far better, IMO.  2/21/17 canned on date.

The smell is lemon hops, malty, floral, and slightly sweet. The taste is bready, floral, with some slight hoppiness underneath. There is also a slight sweetness, and I'm wondering if that is due to the age of this beer. The mouthfeel is slightly thick, medium carbonation, and smooth. Overall a decent APA, but slightly less hoppy than I expected.

Tastes doughy malt and surprising amount of pine. Finish is dry and long lingering pine. Medium body and smooth lighter medium carbonation.

The head seems to last a while and when it does break there is quite nice lacing left in its wake. The smell is heavily malts, with hops behind those bready notes. The hops does not smell super strong on this, but that changes with the taste. The taste sees the malts still present, but the hops come more to the front. The carbonation is moderate, there is a medium body to the beer and I definitely get a dry finish.     All in all a fairly good beer. It might be nice to enjoy a couple of these as you sit on the dock at the lake. I don't think it is my favorite of the style, but I would enjoy this again.

Good lacing.   Moderate tropical fruit hop aroma upfront, some floral hops.  Moderate bitter, high hop flavor, light malty-toasty sweetness. Flavors plays well together.  Medium-light body, high carbonation, watery, fresh and crisp. Long, light dry finish.    It is a crisp and hoppy beer.

Balanced malt and hops, supremely thirst quenching and drinkable. Edit: my tastes, have changed, apparently. Smooth but overly sharp and slightly nail-polishy balanced pine and fruity hop bitterness. Not strong and not super high quality, but not bad or lacking like this brewery's IPA. May have been a great (and mild) introduction to craft beer, but will probably not seek out in the future.

I got moderately-high grassy and citrus hop notes, along with caramel malt, hay and some earthy undertones. Unfortunately I detected an unpleasant buttery aroma/flavour in my sample, which others in my group perceived as a bruised/rotting apple. Will definitely try this again, as there may have been something off with the glassware or this particular batch (I checked, it was canned 3 months prior to consumption). Evidence of a really great beer here. But was hard to ignore what I was perceiving as a slight off-flavour. Will try again.

The head lasts for several minutes, cragging as it dissipates. A gorgeous beer.     S – Low citrus and grapefruit with a touch of green onion, supported by a hefty malt backbone of biscuit and toast. Very crisp, clean, other than pleasant fruity ale esters.     T – Low grapefruit and perhaps nectarine, some peach in there as well. A bit of that green onion note. Malts are biscuit and bread, like a traditional English cookie (aka, a biscuit). Lightly bitter to round things out.     M – Carbonation is moderate and body is medium. Fairly dry throughout. Moderate malt sweetness, balanced with bitterness which rises at the end.     O – A solid, if unremarkable, pale ale. Twenty years ago (or maybe even five) this would have been a standout a la Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Nothing wrong with it as a go-to beer.

Well I can honestly say I am very happy I bought it. It closely resembles SV in looks, smell and taste. Its a great hoppy pale. Smooth and not too heavy or over powering. It is exactly what you want out of a pale. Plus who doesn't love great craft beer from a can?!

This is an excellent pale and was a very good selection for the kegerator (I am not expecting to get sick of it any time soon).

Look: Hazy burnt orange body, with a half finger eggshell colored head.    Smell: Floral hops and grassy notes, citrus fruits.    Feel: Full bodied, with mild carbonation.    Taste: Sweet citrus fruit, pine resin, hops, with a biscuity malt aftertaste.    Overall: Heard a lot of good things about this, in which it did not disappoint, and it sure didn't. More on the bitter side, but also has some nice counteracting notes.

Only a slight hop bitterness with a slight pine note. Overall a solid APA, would pick up another six pack any day I saw it on the shelf.

Smell: fruity, crackery, medium heavy malt. Classically american piny and citrusy hops (I want to say orange more than grapefruit) with a lil earthiness that melds nicely with the malt profile.   Taste: crackery and slightly fruity red malt character, earthy, piny hops. On the back of the tongue, the alcohol is very present and the piny, peppery taste from the hops lingers. Not an incredibly complex beer, but a deep one.  Feel:slightly resinous, medium carbonation.   Overall my favorite Pale Ale, really fantastic. Although I'm curious as to why this would classify as an APA more than an IPA at this point in the style's shift...

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 12 oz. can into one of my pint glasses, this beer pours a mainly clear, slightly cloudy/hazy medium amber color with a slightly tan colored head that's over an inch thick when first poured. the head eventually settles to a thick layer of creamy looking surface foam along with a medium sized to thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with some good lacing. Aromas of some caramel malts along with a fairly big pine and citrus hop presence. The taste is pretty much the same, with slightly toasted and bready, somewhat sweet, caramel malts that are followed by a nice pine and citrus, earthy hop bitterness. While there is a good balance of flavors here, the bitterness does tend to dominate a little bit. Actually, this is one of the hoppier pale ales I've had in awhile. I like it this way too. If I didn't know better I'd think this was an IPA of some sort actually. has a fairly crisp, but also somewhat smooth and frothy, slightly chewy, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. has a clean finish with a decently dry aftertaste. Easy to drink in the way well crafted beer like this ought to be. A very solid beer all around here.    Eric

The beer had a medium/light amber color with a frothy, healthy, creamy head. The bouquet was made up of grapefruit, orange and pine. The taste left a hint of hops, grapefruit and orange on the tongue with medium carbonation. It was really refreshing and crisp with a smooth finish and no aftertaste.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 My can was brewed in Brevard, NC, not in CO. Canned on "04/01/16" according to the can bottom, which also read "PITY THE FOOL" Indeed.     Rich amber color with slightly off-white head and big head. Surprisingly rich color. Nose a rather typical pale ale hoppy nose with fruity hops dominant, but not excessively fruity. Deliciously balanced pale ale taste - not hugely inventive, but balanced, pleasant, with no false notes. Hops forward, dry malt flavor carries the middle flavor, dry finish, typical slightly bitter finish and aftertaste. This would be a good intro pale ale for someone who wanted to know "what pale ales are all about," especially in regards to a basic American style pale ale. Though of course they should probably try a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, too.   
look: 3 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3.5 Pours a pale red with a airy, long-lasting foam head. The smell is fairly sweet and flowery but overall unremarkable. The mouthfeel is thinly laced like cranberry juice. The taste is a well-rounded combination of floral and earthy hops and is wonderfully bitter. This is a slightly above average pale ale.

S- Floral and citrus are the two dominant hop aromas here.    T- Follows the nose, but the bitterness from the citrus that tastes almost of lemon and orange peel is complemented perfectly by the sweet malt base that comes in at the finish with a piney aftertaste. Big flavor for such a comparatively low ABV. More than some IPAs.    F- very smooth, easy drinking body with medium carbonation.    O- For a pale ale, this sets the bar. This is the best representation of the style that I have tried yet. Big flavor, but light enough overall to be incredibly thirst quenching.

Smells of bountiful piney hops, candied citrus aromas, baked bread, and slightly caramel. Taste reflects the smell. Initial pine and orange zest like hops flavors meld into a pleasant caramel and bready flavor. Finishes slightly bitter that lingers for a few moments before weening off. Feel is light, carbonated well, and extremely refreshing. Overall, this is a great standard beer with good flavors and aromas that make this a pleasant drink.

Appearance: It poured a clear copper colour with a less than two finger slightly off white head that dissipated slowly to a nice puffy layer and left nice stringy lacing.    Aroma: A lot of pine and wood with a hint of citrus orange peel zest.    Taste: Orange citrus with a bitter piney hop in the background and honey caramel malts.

Looks present themselves well, amberish with a full head that sticks around and to the glass.  Smells like a fruity AIPA with sufficient malt backbone, but hops take over and it finishes too dry for me to have it alone.  Twice I've had Dale's Pale with spicy Mexican food. And if I have it again, it will be with spicy food.   Listed in the "1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die", famous for being one of the first craft brewers to can and, you could argue, started a second movement. For that, it deserves to be on the list.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Love the smell of this beer, hoppy, woodey, piney. Taste wise, this is, in my opinion, one of the best American Pale Ale's out there. This is also one of the few beers that I think is better out of the can than on draft. That's just me though.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Dales Pale Ale is at the top of my list in every category. Found this IPA at Wegmans in Woodbridge NJ. Just under $20 for a 12 pack put it in the upper tier price range. Loved the fact that it was in a can and that the box was clearly date stamped.The only problem is that after tasting this hoppy ale its impossible to enjoy the average US beer. It has a strong ABV that needs to be respected.Enjoying a couple of quality DPA for me beats filling up on the corn based lager from a 30 pack. Really a treat, but quantity is usually limited at the stores that carry it. If you see it, try it, well worth it.

Look-It pours a mild haze wrapped in amber orange blossom honey with flecks of gold in the right light. The head is bready and frothy.    Smell-It smells of citrus orange and orange peel zest with plenty of hops, but tampered with some rich malts.    Taste-The flavor is bursting with orange and citrus and ample bitter hops rich in piney resin and hoppy goodness. The malts come through as a caramel and honey type flavor. Medium-bodied.    Overall-It is a great go-to beer and I’ll definitely try it again!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This is one of my all-time go-to beers. Perhaps the Alström Bros gave it a lower rating because it is indeed a bit eccentric compared with mainstream American Pale Ales. This is indeed an IPA, but the combination of heavy malt and resiny hops reminds of of someone who cranks the bass and the treble controls to listen to a tune. It's intense, but at 6% ABV, I welcome its reasonable drinkability. The can is in-your-face Americana with its red, white, and blue decor.   Quick tasting notes: Heavy copper color with a pretty head. A malty, sticky, hoppy aroma indicates a heavy beer, almost a warning sign of something much bigger. Booziness in the nose as well. First taste is actually a hop bitterness smacking me in the face, followed by a tangy, resiny lingering. The malty, citrusy flavor lingers on the of my mouth in a great way. This is a great beer to even drink out of the can--its hold little, if anything, back when consumed in this format. Best paired with a big burger and fries.

This one has been reviewed almost 2000 times , so there is nothing new I can add to the mix. This is one of my all time favorite "go to " crushable beers. In fact , I would say, that this is one of the classic craft beers and could find its way on to the Mount Rushmore of craft beer. Great taste. Great smell. Wont disappoint !   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Poured from a 12oz. can.    A: Pours a deep orange hued amber color with one finger of foamy white head that retains for around a minute and leaves behind some nice lacing.    S: Aromas of citrus, and earthy pine hops, complimented by sweet malts, and floral hop spice. Nothing intricate but still pleasant.     T: Follows the nose with citrus upfront, you get flavors of grapefruit and tangerine, then you get a blast of earthy pine resin, and a sweet malt backbone. Finishes with floral hop bitterness. Very simple, pleasant, and balanced.    M: On the lighter side of medium bodied, with a moderate amount of carbonation. Slick and smooth with a slightly oily bitter finish. Very good drinkability and is very nice on the palate.    O: This is one of those classic go-to brews in my book. If I want nice easy drinking pale it's hard to go wrong with choosing Dales. Overall this is a well balanced and delicious brew that may not blow you away. but it certainly won't disappoint you either.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Pours an unfiltered amber with a frothy white head. A great deal of lacing is left behind. Muted sweet malt, and subtle hops deliver a pleasing and simple aroma. A little bit of malt sweetness is dulled by a little hop bite. Nice and subtle flavors that play well together. Mouth feel is great. It feels mouth coating, smooth, and easy to drink. It's a pleasure to drink. Overall, a great pale ale. The fact that this beer has a little higher ABV, it's easy to drink, and canned makes this a great float trip, camping, or tail gating beer. Cheers!     Served in a 12oz snifter.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 LOOKS: Amber-orange. Poured into skinny shelf glass. 2+ fingers of off white foamy head. Plenty of small bubbles rising. Leaves vey nice thick lacing down the glass.  AROMA: Strong citrus and a little pine. A little bit of a grassy pilsner type note.. Sweet malt.  TASTE: Slightly sweet right up front, then that grapefruit rind bitterness kicks in. Slight astringent quality, probably some Simcoe hops in this. This one leans towards the bitter side and is IPA like, in that way. Not much for pine in the taste.  FEEL: Dry from start to finish. Smooth medium body, and carbonation is mild to average.   OVERALL: Not a huge fan of that astringency in PA's or IPA's, and I get a bit of that in this beer. Other's perceive it in different ways, like pineapple. Well made beer though, just not my thing.  Edit: Let this warm up quite a bit and that did smooth things out a bit with the astringent quality.

Freshness may be an issue as this was canned in April 2015.    Appearance - Pours a dark golden, honey brown colored beer with near read hues. Dale's Pale Ale poured exceptionally hazy and started with a big frothy two finger tan head, that receded to a thin film on top after a few minutes. Some lacing around the sides of the glass.    Appearance - Some floral subtlety, dominated by a big malt bill, caramel especially with some general hoppiness.    Taste - A little leafy, but some pleasant herbal and tea like characteristics in the flavors. Hops and bitterness are muted, not sure if that is the intent or again this is an age related issue, but it works. Trace of candied cantaloupe maybe? Bready goodness underlying too.    Mouthfeel - Smooth and easy to drink, carbonation is on the low side, and body is moderate. No sense of the alcohol.    Overall - Certainly a palatable pale ale, if less hoppy than expected. I would obviously love to try a fresher sample, but given that the beer has held up this well over time, I have to give this the thumps up.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours a golden amber color with a thick, fluffy head. I accidentally poured a little too aggressively and was able to coax a 3+ finger head out of it, whoops. Long lasting foam ring on the top and around the edge of the glass, with good soapy lacing. Smells of floral notes, lemon, and pine. Taste is actually more malty than I expected, but still very good. I got pine resin, crackers, bready sweetness, and lemon peel. Finishes fairly dry and leaves a lot of fresh, clean, hop flavor in the aftertaste. Overall a really nice pale ale that's drinkable enough to have a couple in one sitting.

A fantastic looking design with everything we want in beer artwo to yet something you could still see your grandfather drinking straight from the can. I poured this gem into a nonic style pint glass. I must say the 'stovepipe' is my favorite way to buy Dale's pale ale from now on. Perfect!    A - copper color with an light amberish hue. Bright white head poured with some size and sat nice n plump atop my glass. It subsides to a fairly nice blanket of the same color with good stick.    S - fantastic pale ale aroma. Bright citrus and pine resin from the hop bill. Sweet breadiness to the malt with some subtle notes of hop spice.     T - not quite as balanced as the nose as the hops do the pushing with Dale's. Citrus notes fade quickly to a big jolt of pine resin and a mild hop spice. The sweet bread malt does lay enough backbone to allow one to really sit down and enjoy this pale ale. A one after one setting if you would like. As much as the hops throw themselves forward they nearly vanish in a very crisp, clean finish.    M - this is where the class of breweries are separated for me. Even pale ales should have some thickness and texture to them which Dale's definitely does. No matter the abv in ales the best breweries provide great texture and a thick mouth coating experience. Oskar Blues does this perfectly for this style. Flavorful and enjoyable     O - Dale's Pale Ale is one of the many many great classic craft beers and is still going strong today. This little gem has always been the foundation of who Oskar Blues as a brewery is and remain to this very day. Easy to find and always with a fresh date. This is one I find myself drifting to more and more seems like and rightfully so. It's a great beer and highly enjoyable.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a can dated 9/28/15 into a pint glass. Very standard light copper color with a foamy, bubbly white head. Scent is very pale toned as the style suggests, a little bit of grain and malt on the taste too, very middle of the road pale ale with a decent clean feeling.    Sessionable and relatively refreshing, first thing that hits my mind is good fishing beer -- I don't know why but just gives me a reach into your ice cooler, grab a beer, pop it and voila kind of feel. Very easy drinking, not too high of alcohol, easy to unwind, veryy simple but good beer.     I will admit there are plenty of other choices I'd rather spend my cash on repeatedly but this is a nice beer. I would've thought it was a Texas beer had I not known, just gives off that kind of vibe; that being said I much prefer OB's IPA. Maybe I just like the excitement and variety of the stronger IPA counterparts moreso than the laid back APA style. Cheers!

T: Lemon zest, pine, resin, moderate amount of bitterness, finish is dry with hints of citrus peel in the aftertaste, subtle flavors, very drinkable.

A: Pours a nice dark amber color out of the can with a steady head to it.     S: Very caramel malt oriented and piney right up front with a nice hop presence.     T: Extremely crisp! very refreshing beer, has some nice strong hops towards the end of the sip.     O: As far as Pale Ales go, this has been my favorite. Very easy to drink, pleasant and not boring to drink like most pale ales I've had lately.   
look: 3 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 This one verges into IPA territory with a crisp, aromatic citrus and a nice bitter bite, coming close to grapefruit dankness in Zombie Dust, but not quite at that level.

Appearance: slightly more color than a typical yellow pale ale, above average white head. Medium carbonation. Not sure why this gets such high marks. It seems very pedestrian to me. Not even pedestrian....like a pedestrian with a limp."  **

It dissipated immediately and left barely any lacing.  The smell had a sweet caramel maltiness up front coming across somewhat like a biscuity to bready tone. Light citrus graces the undercarriage of the aroma.  The taste carries the malts again up front in a sweet sort of way. Light citrusy hops play with a side score of bitterness. The aftertaste is manageably sweet. Lingering dry yet somewhat refreshing finish.  The mouthfeel was light bodied with a crisp sweet malty sessionability about it. Carbonation seems to hit right on my tongue for an APA.  Overall, what's all the hubbub about other than just another malty crushable can good for sippin' in the deer stand or fishin' off the lake. Personally, though, I'd go after other cans of APA to deal with my other activities, just me, perhaps.

Tiny carb bubbles happily dance to the surface. Smell is rich malt with grapefruit hiding behind wanting to poke its head out. Taste is easy orange, tangerine and malt bread that molds together forming a great refreshment after a hard day's of work. Light dry body that entices me to drink more. Cheers!

Quite an aesthetically pleasing brew.    S: wow, so floral and piney, it smells like a sweet wildflower hop bouquet in the pine forest.    T: sweet candy malt, well balanced by lots of juicy hops. I’d say a tangerine-pine hop profile.    M: sticks around on the palate. To be expected of such a sugary beer.    O: a really good everyday pale, hopped enough that it might be called an IPA.

I'm just wondering where in the U.S. one can't get this, ah, to no avail, here's the rest.  This was poured into a pint glass, but FYI, I also love to pour this into a can glass every now and again, just gotta have some fun glassware.  The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with a one and a half finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Light lacing stuck around the glass decently.  The smell starts off with a nice caramel maltiness with a balanced dose of citrus hops.  The taste was full throttle to balance and boot my tastebuds to the next level - burst of the citrus smacking around the caramel malts to show an utter display of power in the flavor. The aftertaste does have the caramel malt, so yeah, its pretty sweet. There's a sticky sweet caramel finish.  The mouthfeel sat about light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Carbonation runs good.  Overall, old school styled APA kickin' butt and takin' names for the win! What's not to like? Of course, I'd have this again.

Look : Honey colored body, 40% transparent, with a towering cream colored head standing at a full 3 fingers. It leaves dense, snowy, static-y lace on the sides as it recedes, nearly covering the glass like a disease.     Smell : A mixture of tropical and pine, with a little bit of peach infusion. Malts are crackery, fruit winning out once again towards the end.     Taste : Lots of fruit. Peach, apricot, grapefruit, blood orange. Behind that is biscuit malts, a dump of hop oils, finally wrapping up with a sharp note of pine and skin of a plum.    Feel : Creamy, dense, well-lit carbonation, ends unsubstantial.     Overall : Lots of fruit in this IPA, but it doesn't quite come together for me. Malts are not properly balanced, it ends up being a fruit-hop bomb. The fruit makes me crave sweetness, but instead it's chock full of rind bitterness (no surprise there). Overall it tastes off, I'm just not a fan.

Pours a deep copper color, with a thick eggshell-colored head that leaves quite a bit of sticky lacing as it recedes. Aroma is rather malt forward, with notes of biscuit and light caramel. The hop character becomes a little more assertive on the palate, with bright pine resin and citrus zest bringing lots of bitterness to the party. The finish is crisp and quite dry, with some grapefruit zest bitterness lingering on the back of the tongue. Overall, an excellent pale ale.

I first tried this beer about a year ago on tap at a local bar and recalled it being a bit too hoppy for me. But that was not my experience last night. Hoppy, but not overly so, with a nice mouth feel to it. An enjoyable beer and one I'd drink again, although I'd opt for a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale if both were available.

Appearance is a dark, clear amber with a fluffy off-white head with some nice lacing.     Smell is a bit on the weak side. You have to really search what's going on to find its sweet, malty character with a hint of citrus.     Surprisingly, the hops come through a bit more on than the palate than what the nose would lead you to believe. The citrusy grapefruit note are more prevalent with the bready malt backbone. Fairly balanced.     Moderately carbonated with a nice, dry, peppery finish.     Overall, it's an average beer with a price point that makes it worth the occasional pick up.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 Pretty decent beer. Very smooth and drinkable. Smell is mildly malty with a bit of orange. The taste follows malty and orange with a touch of hops. yb

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 This beer is deep amber in color, crystal-clear and sparkling, with a giant, slightly pebbly off-white head that leaves fair rafts of lacing. One the nose, it is moderate in intensity: a fairly straightforward blend of spicy florals and lesser amounts of pine with bready malt notes and faint alcohol undertones. On the palate it presents bitter, spicy hops up front, with some pine, grapefruit and alcohol notes joining in midway; the hops presence largely obscures a slightly-sweet bready malt backbone. The finish is slightly bitter, followed by the onset of a long-lingering hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, moderately creamy and peppery from some very present fizzy carbonation. The hops focus here is more on bitterness than flavor/aroma, not so much what I look for in an APA. (12 oz can, 18 days after pkg.)

A really nice, affordable and transportable (packaged in cans) Pale Ale

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. Canned on 7/09/15, so it's just under a month old. Sweet.    LOOK: Clear, lightly bubbly amber with a finger of creamy beige head. Nice curtains of lacing.    SMELL: Thick juicy grapefruit, a little bit of orange zest, light pine notes, and sweet caramel malt.    TASTE: Hoppy upfront. Lots of sweet grapefruit juice and bitter orange peel. Sweet caramel malt takes over in the middle with some sappy pine notes. Finishes surprisingly bitter with pine resin, chalky yeast notes, grapefruit peel, and faint alcohol warmth.    FEEL: Medium-bodied, juicy upfront and finishes dry. Moderate carbonation. Nice drinkability.    OVERALL: A pretty tasty pale ale that leans toward being an IPA. A good beer.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a half finger white head that dissipates to thick patches leaving good lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, piney and lightly citrus hops. Flavor is caramel malt with a hint of biscuit, robust piney hops with grapefruit citrus, finishing with a mildly resinous piney and citrus rind bitterness. Medium bodied with great carbonation. A great malty and well hopped pale ale that moves into IPA territory, but still to style. Has my favorite combination of caramel malt and piney hop; well balanced and flavorful. Pale ales are a coin toss for me, even nice ones leave me wishing I had gone for the IPA gusto; but this one was left me happy and wishing for a bigger can. Well done.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 From the 12oz (Brevard, NC) can into a "pint" glass. This is and has been one of my favorites for a few years now. I'm glad to see that it has become more and more available.     Golden amber pour. Rich, thick white head. To get it in a 12 oz glass, the first two seconds need to be down the side of the glass.Then, straight down the center. A great release as the glass fills and reaches above the rim.     It's been said before, no doubt. This is a citrusy, malty beer. Strong flavor that never bites back, but still faint molasses texture that leaves great flavor from sip to sip.     It's hard to turn down a Dales when someone offers...unless I've already had two. A great, strong, full-flavor pale ale.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Into my tulip glass at cellar temperature it goes.    It's called a pale ale, but it really is not all that pale. Amber-orange with a 2-cm crown of foam that I would describe as off-white and sudsy.    It smells of honey, orange, and hops that are both floral and herbal. Yeah... got some good herb 'ere.    That's a smooth flavor, from start to finish. Crsply bready, with some tangy citrus and a finish which smacks of pine and orange zest. The bitterness is worthy of note... so much so that I would call this an IPA in character.    Medium feel, medium carbonation. High quaffability.    This stuff is an excellent vehicle for hops, and I can swig it stupid smooth.

The taste is really good and is full of malt, hops and citrus. the aroma matches the flavor and it is a medium bodied beer with heavy carbonation. Overall, this is my second favorite beer from Oskar behind Ten Fiddy.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Pours a glowing, coppery-amber color with a great looking, big, froth head.    Smells of lemon zest and cakey malts with a whiff of kiwi added, showcasing a pleasant, thoughtful put together hop profile.     Drinks easy, with a higher carbonation to it, revealing a fitting balance between hops and malts.    Tastes of syrup coated malts, melting together with fruity hops, revealing orange and crisp lemon zest. Lemon invites a prominent dryness to the otherwise very malty beer, giving it an inviting hop character, which then results into a long lasting, lemony dryness. During its finish, the beer reveals a mineralic quality, carried to the tongue by the lively carbonation, while malts and hops are still there, providing an easy agreeable bitterness.    Well balanced and easy drinkable, while its hop profile is well integrated into the distinct malts and the higher, refreshing carbonation.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pleasant surprise. Nice hoppy nose, classic west coast, almost IPA levels. Taste was more bitter than average pale ale, but had a solid malt backbone. Overall, well balanced and full of flavor. Will buy again.  Edit...had on tap again recently and this fell short of my previous tastings. Rare instance of docking a beer upon subsequent tasting. Current review is halfway between fresh can review in July 2015 (4.25 for aroma and taste) and fresh tap review in October 2015 (3.75 aroma and taste).
