Shockingly very little aroma. Taste is fine with a slight bitter aftertaste. For an IPA though the hops aren't very prominent. In summary not a bad drinking beer but nothing really great.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Slightly thin body with about medium carbonation.   Aroma is grapefruit,orange and grapefruit peel. Mostly citrus rather than bitter hops  Taste is identical to aroma, mostly orange/ grapefruit citrus with mild bitterness there's no pine or extreme bitterness which makes this incredibly easy to drink

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours like amber shades of grain. Strong citrus melody that matches the great taste. Goes down smooth and easy with a hoppy finish you expect. Overall this is an outstanding beer from a brewer that hits the mark every time.

It really makes me feel like it's summer.  Taste - Very sweet and sugary. Lots of juicy tropical fruit and piney hop resin. I don't find this to have a grapefruit flavor, rather it's sweet mango and peach followed by pine tree, the flavors never combine, to me anyways. Carbonation is just medium. Medium bodied, but fairly drinkable. Bitterness may seem strong to those that don't drink much of these types of beers, but to me it's perfectly balanced, not too bitter.    Overall, there is a reason this is expensive and now i know why, hands down the best IPA i have tasted, so fresh and juicy. And it's not super filling which is great, looking forward to buying more. Grade is A+

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5 The best IPA period. No need to waste time with the various derivatives, though they are special, original Sculpin is why we have IPA’s.     The flavor cuts through the floral happiness to reduce bitterness. Too many IPA’s just add a ton of hops, flavor be damned. Sculpin uses them properly.     Not for a sesh, but good food and 2-3 Sculpins make for a enchanting evening.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a nice white head, a bit carbonated, with more a malty character than grapefruit. Great tasting drinkable beer. Price point is a bit high for an american IPA at 7% ABV

I was quite excited, as I love the style, the ratings are high and this is the first time I saw this sold in Toronto.  The nose is decent, but man the taste isn't. Way too bitter (and this bitterness overwhelms any other possible flavour within), with lingering effects that also include an uncomfortable film in the back of your throat.   I bought a six pack and I will finish but...A real bummer, this one.

It certainly was flavorful; however, it was not hoppy like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which I do like. (Not associated.) It had very good taste, a very good feel and smell but that extra hoppiness that one expects with a craft brewed IPA just was not there. It was certainly worth buying to try and I may even buy some more in the future but I think I'll have to wait for it to be on sale.

S - piney, bitter hops along with sweet citrus up front. The smell is pretty prominent and refreshing.   T - Piney bitter hops up front and throughout mixed alongside notes of tropical fruits and citrus - tired together with a very slight malty backbone.   F - Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Smooth, somewhat creamy but somewhat crisp.  O - This is an incredible all arounder IPA - it's balanced quite nicely. It's a standard, no frills IPA, but it does everything it sets out to do, an needs to do to be a great IPA, very well. Can't believe I hadn't tried this one sooner.

I got the Aloha "tropical" version of this yesterday and it was too bitter/hoppy for me. THIS is what I was hoping for yesterday: peach, pear and grapefruit taste in that order. Make sure to get thos on the bottom of your tounge--that's my favorite part of this taste. Brings out the pear more, somewhat similar to a Belgian beer. Ya, looks nice in a glass too. Bitterness is balanced against the fruit perfectly for my taste. San Diego makin me proud again with this one.

It is a solid beer, but the grapefruit is WAY too robust for this to be just an IPA. If this were a fruited beer section (no idea if they exist on here yet), then this beer would definitely compete for the top spot. There are dozens of incredible IPAs that I'd put above this.

If I wanted grapefruit in my drink, I would make a paloma from one of my fine tequilas. I am delving into craft beers very late in my life and this beer only backs up my theory that craft beers are for hipsters who have yet to graduate from snowball syrup to fine distilled spirits. I did find one great craft beer with Founders Centennial IPA and it's bye-bye Heineken for me.

This pretty awesome IPA is tasty and damn good looking beer.     Had it on draft in a warm pint glass at the end of June 2018.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 On tap at the Bier Markt - Square One. Served cold into a pint glass. Review from notes.    Appearance - Clear dark amber colored brew, a half finger of off-white head sits on top and lingers for most of the beer. Good clarity.    Smell - A tropical aromapalooza with grapefruit being most prominent, but lemon, melon and pineapple making guest appearances. A very fine IPA aroma.    Taste - Pretty good as well with the grapefruit being the showstopper and a touch of melon and pineapple (with strawberry momentarily?) mid sip. Taste finishes very bitter with lemon and grapefruit and some piney flavors seeping through. A touch too bitter for the sake of being bitter to my tastebuds.    Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, expressive carbonation, fine dry finish. Here and on the nose is why I see this is absolutely considered a world class IPA.    Overall - Really enjoyed my experience with Sculpin, would love to try a fresh bottle or on a beach somewhere much south of here, see how it stacks up.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Tasted from a 12 oz bottle bought in Oxnard, CA.    L - Hazy but bright with a golden-orange color; it almost looks like a witbier. Head is off-white in color and not very impressive in initial size or persistence.     S - Aromas of huge citrus (mostly grapefruit) and tropical fruits to a lesser extent. There is a nice cracked grain note and some bready malt in the background.     T - Sharp, almost sour, hops flavors hit initially, with lots of grapefruit juice character. These same sharp citrus flavors stretch through the mid-palate and into the finish and aftertaste. Along the way there is just a bit of grainy malt.    F - Medium body. Low to moderate carbonation. Very strong, bracing bitterness from the hops. Low alcohol warmth. Dry finish.    0 - I find this a nice West Coast IPA, but in my opinion it is a bit one-dimensional with the grapefruit-character hops and little else. Not a lot of malt to offset, or any kind of depth of flavor.

Over the past few months, I've had several Sculpins that were less than 6 weeks in the bottle, and they all lacked the intensity and punch that I associate with Sculpin back in the day. I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist or some old fart who drones on about how "they don't make 'em like they used to", but unless my tastes have changed dramatically in the past couple of years, someone has watered down the recipe for this beer. It's not terrible by any stretch. It's just ... underwhelming.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 2/17/18: 16 oz draft pour into Flamingo plastic cup in their poker room. Mild carbonation, blond pour, minimal white lacing. Pine citrus aroma, taste consistent with aroma, heavy bitterness, very pleasant. Nice firm mouth feel, medium body, fizzy carbonation holds. Overall very good IPA.

White head.    Intense aroma, spot on for an IPA. Some citrus and sprucy notes. Slight bit of spices. Balanced dry-maltyness.    Just a good IPA. So much better balanced that many I've had lately. This one is worth looking for.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.25 The first thing that popped in my mind -- this tastes almost exactly like Fresh Squeezed IPA from Deschutes! This has a lighter body with less of a grapefruit taste and a little less bitterness. It's so tasty I can't stop drinking it. There is a very distinct fruity flavor to this and then a very distinct bitterness to it at the end. I'm not a fan of bitterness in general, but this is a level of bitterness that I can handle. The only thing I like better about Fresh Squeezed IPA is it's body -- otherwise I'd say this is the champ between the two -- especially if you're looking for something that's on the lighter side, crisp, refreshing, and that has a lot of flavor.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This beer has a great, cloudy amber color and smells like the various fruits that add to the flavor. The hops provide the perfect tradidtional bite of an IPA. The difference comes from how refreshing this beer is. Unlike an average IPA, which is hard to put down more than two or three, I could drink this beer every hour for a week straight. I may just have.

Aroma of sharp hops with touches of ripe tropical fruits and lemon.    Flavor is assertively hoppy and if this is what you want you got it. The taste is similar to the scent but with a lot more resin influence riding on a solid malt base. Very complex group of flavors that work well together.    Full texture with balancing carbonation.    It has a lot of hop flavor, I'll give it that. Overall a hallmark beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured fridge temp into a pint glass. Amber gold, medium carbonation, 3-finger head that held on for a bit, some lacing. Piney/fruity aroma with a similar taste, I get a definite pine taste with a smooth bitterness, if that’s possible. Good mouth feel. A favorite.

Delicate and simply tasty beer. Big success at Xmas dinner last night. A big plus is its price to value-quality. Amazing that Ballast Point can brew this and sell at a reasonable price.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 A classic IPA in my opinion. And due to its mainstream appeal you can find it almost everywhere.    The citrus and hoppy aromas are very delicate. The orange smells mixed with hoppy bitterness is just so well done. Great beer to get if the bar doesnt have other cool rotating options to try (like Buffalo Wild Wings).

It is a solid IPA and I do find it better than a few other big time selling West Coast IPAs, but there are far better options these days in the ABV range and still way cheaper in price. I'll stick with Alpine Duet and Knee Deep Breaking Bud.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Last beer of the night, Sculpin IPA from Ballast Point, ABV 7.00%. The can says "dedicated to the craft", which is why they sold out to constellation. Well seriously it is still a very good IPA, I just wish everybody wouldn't be selling out.    Look: semi-clear, almost clear, golden with an inch white head, nice lacing.    Aroma: citrus, tropical fruit, pine resin    Taste: It is sweet, fruity, mango, citrus, and significant pine, a very nice but slightly bitter flavor.    Feel: medium bodied, fairly easy drinking

Poured into a pint glass. Disappointing head, decent lacing. A subdued citrus smell. Pleasant bitterness. Will need to try again, but this is an honest rating for what is in my glass.

Having said that this is a terrific beer! Special occasions only.  Pours less than clear pale gold with a modest near snow white head that has superior staying power and plenty of side glass lace.  Smell: Lots of pine and pine nuts along with a citrus rind hop aroma.  Taste: Great balance of the pine nuts, citrus hops and some up front sweet bread malts. Has great balance!  Thick, chewy with a slight bitter finish.  The benefits of having a son-in-law that will shell out the equivalent of $60.00 for a case of beer.

Could smell it as soon as I open the bottle and hadn't even poured it yet. The smell reminded me that hops and marijuana are closely related plants.     T: Again, grapefruit but with the earthy hop flavors predominate. Ends with a little bit of fruit at the finish, like mangoes or pineapple.     F: Light, but plenty of hop oils that coat your mouth.     o: Very aromatic and a solid IPA overall. I marked it down a little because it is a little pricey for what you get, so I won't be drinking it often. Definitely worth trying though.

look: 3.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Poured into a chilled pint glass from a bottle  L.

Mild pine and citrus with with a malt foundation.  T. Nice amount of pine with a bit more malt , much like the smell for me only more pronounced.  F. nice carbonation retention, malty pallet with a lingering sweetness.  O. Enjoyable for the lighter piney IPA seeker, have had it on tap which I really enjoyed, why I picked up a will stay on my go to list.

So either this is a fresh can that has been exposed to extreme conditions or the labeling format is misleading and ambiguous. This beer looks nice with a clear amber appearance and with a nice two finger head that does not last for long however. The nose is fairly malty, with some piney hops to provide some balance. The taste is also malty, with some bitterness late on. Some caramel and toasty notes but as far as hops are concerned it's just bitterness they contribute.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a chalice: color is straw gold, a slight dense quality, not hazy just not clear - pretty spot on for an ipa. Head is brighter off white with fine to medium sized bubbles, head presents 1/2 inch thick and lingers very well.     Smell is citrus rind, dominant, then light clean pale malt.    Taste has slightly more maltiness, citrus/grapefruit/earth like hoppiness pervades. Just well constructed, simple but hoppy flavor.     Mouthfeel is moderate, with good carbonation, great bitterness, and just enough sweet balance.    Overall a very good IPA - simple, hoppy, bitter, no extraneous flavors.

I have long been intrigued by this beer that sells for $13 (or more) a 6 pack. From start to finish (nose to after taste) this beer is impressive.  Unfortunately, at its price point, I may never drink it again. The only reason I am trying it is that it was in the Ballast Point "Sextant Collection" variety 12-pack.  7.0% ABV, 70 IBU.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This was poured into a nonic pint. The appearance was a hazy burnt orange to slightly bronzed brown color. There’s a nice looking big white foamy two finger head that dissipated to a rocky level for a sustainable moment but eventually dissipated to a fine lacing sticking and sliding at the same time. The smell had a nice sticky sweet grapefruit, light lemon and pine running over some light caramel malt. The taste was sweet and bitter with a fairly decent sweet piney to lemon bitterness over my taste buds. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. I would say this was fairly sessionable. The carbonation was good for the style and for me. There’s a nice bitterness running over my tongue in a proper AIPA sort of way. Overall, wow, this was a great AIPA that I could bang again. It came across in every good AIPA sort of way and has a good sessionability about it that could definitely go with it’s respected food.

Appearance: Clear, bright gold with a tall, foamy heady of white bubbles and thick, sudsy lace.    Smell: Pine needles and sap, grapefruit zest; peaches, apricots and mangos.    Taste: Fruity and juicy: plenty of ruby grapefruit, peaches and tropical fruit. Dank pine resin and herbal bitterness cut through the fruit notes for a clean, dry finish.    Mouthfeel: Medium body, slightly oily feel and moderate carbonation. Just a hint of alcoholic heat as it loses its chill.    Overall: Quintessential juicy IPA with plenty of citrus and tropical fruit notes, but still enough balance and bitterness - solid, drinkable IPA.

The best thing about the drink is by far the flavor hints of pine yet has some sweetness to it. It doesn't have a strong scent to it. Not as bitter as its brothers to the north being Washington and Oregon IPA's but most definitely is a wonderful beer.

I ofter like to buy IPAs from the store that other people swear by (usually east coasters), and then I come back to this one and remember how good it is. When trying other IPAs from Whole Foods, etc, I'm disappointed more ofter than not, not because the beers I'm trying are bad, but just because I've become spoiled by how solid of a beer Sculpin is.

Very bitter in the back of the throat with too much unpleasant linger. I understand this is a classic IPA staple but it is not my kind of IPA. I desire more malt and balance. Still, I admit that I need to revisit it in depth and it may grow on me.

It's just that I've had many other IPAs that aren't in the top 250 which have impressed me far more than this one. Easy to drink compared to other IPAs with plenty of citrus and hops, smells and looks great, and in my opinion would be a good starting IPA for newer beer drinkers.

This beer looks great with a 2 plus finger, soft and fluffy, almost white, lasting head resting over a crystal clear, golden amber body. It has a decent nose with pineapple and citrus notes. In the mouth it has the same citrus flavors with a decent malt presence, moderate hop bitterness and finishes dry with some lingering bitterness. With the medium carbonation and light body it is pretty smooth and easy to drink.    I think this is a great IPA that seems to pale in comparison to the new order of IPA's. I would drink this again but will most likely go with local options that haven't had to be shipped across the country. Though I am glad to have finally tried it.

But in a market that includes IPA's that have become inventive and diverse in their flavors, this is kind of bland. Not unpleasant. Just not impressive and unique. But that's ok. Sometimes you want a higher ABV, non session IPA that is dry with medium to low hops (for an IPA), no floral or fruit or any other notes, and a super clean (again for an IPA), slightly dry finish. After normalizing your palate to IPA's, you'll probably find Sculpin to be good but unchalenging and palatable to drink over an extended period of time, as long as you don't fall down. I personally use Grapefruit Sculpin as my benchmark against which to measure citrus infused IPA's, but that's a different beer, different story. This isn't a shot across the bow of Ballast Point which I think produces some amazing brews, especially The Commodore, particularly the holiday version. Ok, now I'm just ranting.

However, the hop taste is balanced by some malt and yeast character, so it’s not an IPA that punches you in the mouth, and is surprisingly smooth. Floral, tropical fruit notes. Dry finish with the faintest hints of citrus. Cool artwork on the label...ugly fish but a great beer. Pairs nicely with fish tacos.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 Not sure what the hype is surrounding this beer. Would not be a beer I would seek out again. In fact, I've yet to find a beer in their collection that I've enjoyed. Not sure if it's the marketing that's gotten them the hype, but this beer doesn't do it for me.     The pour was probably the best thing about this beer, though nothing stood out as memorable. Copper in tone with some haze & a decent head. The nose was strong on citra, but lacking any depth or complexity. It didn't get much better from there. A malty IPA with a piney finish and little bite that is characteristic of a west coast IPA. Decent mouth feel, a touch on the dry side which I actually prefer. Overall, an unimpressive beer in an overall unimpressive line up. Not sure how/why this makes the BA250.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Good stuff but highly overrated in my opinion. It appears to be placed in the highest echelons of the finest beers. However the price for this beer is a bit (or more) higher than what we can get here in Indiana.....ie.., 3 Floyds... which we can get FRESH here. ********ADD ON: drinking one now 9/7/17.... It IS outstanding, no doubt. I bet it's cheaper in California though. Just wondering. Could be that when we get it here in the midwest it is not as fresh. NO date on the bottle other than a confusing code on the bottom of the bottle....unlike the unmistakable "bottled on" or "best by "  dates that I look for and see on most brewery's bottles designed to make sure you have something that's not stale.

O: for a beer listed in top 250 I expected to be blown away, I'm not. This beer does not belong there and should be replaced with Stone Ruin 2.0 or Stone delicious IPA. It is an okay beer, okay IPA but nothing special, something is missing to make it excell. It is not a beer I plan to buy again as there are many better IPA's in the market. And for the record it's a month and half old so should still be good, not to mention I've had delicious IPA 2 and a half months old that tastes better than this one.

Listen to me, like I brew it. I've only has it about a dozen times. I also really enjoy Grapefruit Sculpin, although they're the only 2 I've tried. Taste in this one is all pleasant hops; definitely grapefruit & other citrus & floral; pretty juicy, light piney at first which then comes on more / with a touch more fruit maybe mango. Smooth & well balanced. I will enjoy this again. (Score 4.35)    Edit July 2018. What happened to Sculpin? I can't get it in Canada but I bought a 6 pack last night in the US & while there's some hop character, the taste seems dominated by sweet caramel malt. Not what I remembered. Is this another case of a brewery buy-out causing the beer quality to dramatically decrease? (Score 3.5)   
look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 I was especially excited to try this IPA based upon the excellent ratings. It pours a hazy golden amber with decent head and lacing. The aroma is lightly citrus and pine. The taste is essentially a middle of the road IPA. It is rather poorly balanced with little citrus/pine hop taste. Definitely nothing special. I tried this IPA twice at different times on tap and once in a bottle. At $13.99 a six pack, it is no bargain. I can't understand all of the high ratings.

So far have been pretty disappointed with Mango Even Keel and Watermelon Dorado. I thought grapefruit sculpin was good, but not great. Expected to not like this as much as grapefruit sculpin but was surprised that this is better.    Look: Dark golden and clear. Generated a rather large amount of head even though I poured down the side. Definitely looks refreshing.  Smell: Citrus, pineapple, and pine. Is this grapefruit sculpin? Or is it pineapple? Pleasant and inviting without being too overpowering.   Taste: I'm getting a lot of pineapple with a fair amount of hops. Almost tastes like I'm drinking juice instead of beer.  Finish: Crisp and refreshing helped along by the brightness of the citrus. Definitely a hoppy aftertaste with some slight malt. A fair bit stickier than I would have liked, but it's Ballast Point. Plus the fruit juiciness really helps mitigate it. Lychee flavor settles in long after drinking. Less stickiness and it would be perfect.  Overall: Very pleased with this after being disappointed by the Ballast Point fruit beers. I understand why BP decided to add grapefruit and pineapple since the beer has so much intrinsic grapefruit and pineapple flavor. However, adding fruit just messes up the balance so delicately created in regular sculpin. Only thing I wish is that it were cheaper. It's hard to justify $2.50/12 oz when there are many other great west coast IPAs for less.

Simcoe, and citrus are good, but the malt profile just doesn't agree with me. I actually, for once, approve of the fruity versions (pineapple, grapefruit) better than the original.

Aroma, first thing that jumps out is that catty Simcoe hop, my least favorite hop. Citrus, mostly lemon and a little orange and a bit of peach. Flavor, bit of that astringent, ammonia/catty like quality, again, I bet this has Simcoe. Cracker bread malt, lots of citrus/lemon, nice building bitter bite. Feel is full carbonation, dry, and medium body. I'm sure if I was a fan of certain hops, I'd like this a lot more, so I'll keep that in mind when I choose brews in the future, and I'll be kind, here.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I once had it on-tap and got unpleasant experience thought my glass was pressed poorly without head and served in too warm temperature. So, I decide to have it again this time on bottle.    355ml bottle poured into a teku glass.    Translucent but not transparent gold amber color with thick white fluffy head, it stands with good retention before subsiding to everlasting foamy film atop and leaves plenty of sticky lacing patch all along.    Apricot, peach, lemon, orange peel, grapefruit, earthy, pine, resin, and spice, all of these scents are derived from its hoppy affair. Sweet malty, biscuity, slight caramel too, overall the aroma is well mellow with resiny and juicy hoppiness.    The taste is mostly leant towards piney and resiny hop yet some spice rather than fruity. The bitterness is upright and strong enough to satisfy any hopheads. Anyway, suggestion of fruit is still able to be sensed through apricot, peach, grapefruit, and orange peel notes while malt acts as a foundation of the flavor structure providing sweetness, caramel, and biscuit profile.    Light to medium body with smooth mouthfeel through the palate, medium carbonation with crisp and lively feeling through the taste buds, finish is pleasantly dry. This brew is the benchmark, the good work of craft, and the master representing American IPA character.

Golden amber body with 1 finger pure white head , nice heavy lacing , quite a bit of carbonation bubbles running up the glass,no floaters but looks unfiltered .    Smell is hoppy of course but not floral ,almost a hint of citrus or something in the background.    Taste is a bit like juniper or some other ever green with a slightly burnt hoppy ending , smell is better than the taste imo.    Feel is nice , medium body, certainly not watery.    Overall it's not my thing as far as ipa goes, ide rather have a dogfish head.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 I guess we all have different palates, but I was really excited to taste this today , however was quite disappointed for a top 250 brew .  I'm not going to say it was bad overall, but being a noob to IPA's it was not even close to the Bolero Snort Rogue Bull I had earlier today .  I had with red beans and rice, so it was refreshing, however the bitterness at the end kind of let me down .  Beautiful amber color and a wonderful smell , however I just couldn't get past the bitterness.  I will try it again as even my friends truly love it as an IPA, but maybe I was expecting too much for a a common shelf beer .  As a stout and dark ale drinker it is quite an adjustment, so we will see in time :)  Next up will be Pineapple Sculpin ;)

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 My friends and I are always trying to find the best IPA Beer. So we all got together today with 16 different IPA'S and had a taste test. Grant we all had our favorite brands and thought we knew a lot about beer. Our final two beers were Ale Smith IPA and Sculipin IPA. Sculpin won our taste test 6 votes to 2 due to a better finishing taste.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 When I first had this it was one of the best. It is still a strong beer but there are so many awesome options. This one is just a great beer with a nice crisp smooth hop taste. I'd still prefer the grapefruit sculpin.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured from the bottle into a tulip    Appearance: amber-golden. A vigorous light tan head of silky find bubbles forms immediately when poured. Very pretty. Good head retention.    Aroma: sharp, piney, like resin. Very "dry" smelling if such a thing is possible. Inviting.    Flavor: wow! This is much different and better than memory serves. The malt is sweet and extremely honey-like in flavor. Super hoppy and dry. The hops contribute more honey flavor and melon...honey melon?, but honey foremost. No off flavors whatsoever.     Mouthfeel: medium, but the body seems to add up as you progress through the bottle. Multiple beers would weigh you down.     Overall: much different than memory and far better. My memory was a positive one, but the refresher was better still. I can't stress enough the honey flavor. Other beers have this same honey flavor, but none with absolutely no off flavors. Very good. A repeat purchase for certain.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a cigar city pint glass.    Thin white frothy head,nice looking cascade that ends quickly along with the head.Golden straw color,with amber tint.Crystal clear through the glass,with light carbonation.    The nose is mostly hops,with a floral background.    The palate is mostly west coast hops,with notes is citrus.Small hints off floral notes,with a little bit of dankness.    The body is medium with some hop fizzling in the mouth.    This is a solid IPA.I personally think it is a little overrated,but that is my opinion.Definitely a good IPA,definitely one I would drink again...But it doesn't crack my top 10.

The tropical fruit kicks in and slight taste of maybe caramel also.    Clean crisp feel that makes this very drinkable.     Overall a great IPA. Easy to drink and enjoy.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Sculpin IPA brewed by Ballast Point Brewing Company, with an ABV of 7.00% This IPA pours out a golden amber color with a small white head. There is also a nice cloudy tint to Sculpin IPA. Sculpin IPA is an unfiltered brew you can not see though this IPA. The smell of Sculpin IPA, is nice with hops, grains and malts. You also pick up on a mild sweetness in the smell of this brew. The smell is really inviting. There is also a fair amount of lacing to this IPA. Now for the taste, it is bold with hops at first. Then it smooths out with sweet grains and malts. There is a lot going on in Sculpin IPA . This IPA had the look, smell and taste of most IPA's on the market. Not saying that is a bad thing. What sets this IPA form the others is how smooth it is. Sculpin IPA has a super nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.00% ABV in this brew. The month feel of Sculpin IPA is, Rich, Bold, Clean Smooth and Refreshing. I really how bold this brew is however it goes down nice and smooth. Overall I'm giving Sculpin IPA a 4.50 out of 5. I would buy this brew again. If you are a fan of IPA's look this brew up. Ballast Point Brewing Company, did a real nice job with this brew.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Appearance: A golden-coppery orange with a reddish hue. A good amount of rising foamy white head and some decent looking lacing left behind as it settles.    Aromatics: Fairly strong floral infused pineapple and grapefruit citrus with pine resin. I also get a good level of toasty raisin that keeps the balance closer to the sweeter end of the spectrum. I actually really like the how the subtle sweet malt seems to drift in just underneath.     Taste: There is a bit of a yeasty bread sweetness right at the start that quickly moves on to the more intense citrus peel and earthy pine of the hops. The bitter is equivalent to day old coffee with a hint of mocha added.    Mouth: A decent amount of carbonation (not too much) it sits just below "lively" and is good enough to add a nice sensation to the palate. Body is definitely medium, and doesn't wander closer to one end or the other. It's intake is slick and warming, the finish is of moderate length and intensity with a bitter that has a good heft to it.    Overall: I really enjoyed the complexity and freshness. It is one of the better IPAs I've had, even though IPAs are not my usual these days, and I tend to prefer East Coast hop varieties better than the West, so that probably plays a role in my overall impression. Would I drink it again? You bet! But I'm in agreement with many of the others who have ranked it and noted that it just seem to be as far up the chart as other highly praised beers.

Pours slightly hazy medium orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of bright citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon/orange rind, pine, toasted biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and minimal lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, and lightly creamy/grainy balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Minimal warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is an incredible IPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink despite very resinous bitterness. A highly enjoyable offering.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Very good IPA. Not as floral as some of the real good IPAs but still very hoppy and a good mouthfeel. Very unassuming by the looks, but tastes strong and finished smooth.

Sweet, sugary IPA hop aroma: tropical citrusy fruits such as pineapple and orange and apricot and tangerine. Piney hops. Honey. A hint of white bread. Delicious, but sort-of mild.     Taste: mild but present hops: fruity (as described above), and the piney hops as well. Honey-oat malt character. I tell you what: this beer is so well put together. The flavors blend with such harmony. It's not so much a round beer as it is a well-blended beer. And the hop profile is one of the most pleasant hop profiles of my beer-drinking experience, for it is not too oily nor does it leave a lasting bitterness on the back of my tongue. I am not an IPA guy, but I could honestly drink this one year-round and not get tired of it. (Still, not as good as Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA.)     Mouthfeel/finish: medium-full, light carbonation; clean, bitter, refreshing.    Overall: I like it as much as I like Sierra Nevada but the price is outrageous, so I would probably go with Airrra Nevada Extra IPA

Overall I still think it's a more than decent beer, and if I saw this at a party I wouldn't hesitate to grab a bottle.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Having this on-tap. This beer draws a pretty clear, medium golden color with a bit of an orange hue and a white head that's about half an inch thick when first drawn and served. Head settles to a medium sized to thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with some bits of foam on the beer's surface. Aromas of slightly toasted caramel malt notes along with mango, melon, and citrus hops. The taste is pretty much the same, with slightly toasted caramel malt sweetness that gives way to mango, melon, and citrus hop bitterness that also has a bit of an earthy note to it. Good balance of flavors here. Has a mainly crisp, slightly smooth and frothy, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish. easy to drink in the good way.    Eric

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I actually reviewed this beer about a year and a half ago.  I deleted the review, because the beer was totally different than the last time.    Since Ballast Point is now part of a bigger company, it has better distribution, and fresher bottle dates. Years ago, it was not uncommon for Sculpin to be 8 months old.    This can was brewed in late July. Less than 2 months.    Poured a golden copper- red color with a 3F head in a Spiegalau glass.    Wonderfully fragrant aroma, spicy, piney, other fruit.    Taste follows the aroma : pine, fruit- stone fruit, very spicy and carbonated.    Good hoppy finish, not too strong.    Okay, this the Sculpin which has the great rep.  Class-act West Coast IPA.    More for the fridge in the near future.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 An amber orange color with a rich smell of hops and citrus. Tastes very citrussy, a little piney, and has a mild bitter bite towards the end. Feels solidly medium bodied. Overall it's a fine example of the style.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 I enjoyed Sculpin from a 12oz bottle poured into a shaker pint glass. The beer pours a dark, golden, orange that looks as refreshing as it tastes. There was about a finger and a half of paper white head with good lacing on the glass.     The aroma is very strong and is dominated by citrus, floral, and fresh characteristics. I picked up lots of orange and grapefruit.     This is a medium-heavy bodied beer that feels hearty and sweet with a nice amount of carbonation and buttery smooth finish. It is a great level of bitterness compared to lots of other IPA's. I'll probably pick up another sixer of Sculpin as long as I can not look at the price.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Tried this a couple of times but don't think it's worth the price or its vaunted status. A bit lighter and at least as complex as a Dogfish 60, I'll give it that. A fine IPA but the price just grinds my shorts. I also prefer the richness of the Two-Hearted at a bit lower price point.
