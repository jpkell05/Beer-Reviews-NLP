look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Poured from 750ml bottle into glass. Caged and corked bottle.   Amber brown colored body. Each pour brings out a voluminous, fizzy head that recedes very quickly. No coverage of lacing.  Aroma of banana, raisin, cherry, apricot, green apple, sweet light molasses, sweet bread, and cloves.  Taste is sublime and sweet, with toffee, raisin/pear/cherry, banana, sweet malts, tobacco, and cloves/cinnamon.   Medium to full mouth feel. Has alcohol vapors that percolate into the nasal passages. Very good carbonation. Prone to cause burping.   A tremendously tasty, and well put together beer. So easy to drink, even though the higher alcohol % is apparent. Best to drink at the recommended low to mid 50s F.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 L- Pours a two and a half finger rocky headed ale with a nice live carbonation present. Dark and mahogany in color, with a slight amber tint.   S- Immediate aroma of raison, molasses, dried apricots, ripe pear, tobacco leaf, apple, toffee, yeasty banana, clove, red wine, brown sugar, and an aged oak earthiness. A nice juicy and punchy aroma.   T- Smooth, toned down and delicious. Slight stone fruit, followed by a sweet, but well balanced malty kick, toasted flavor, aged earthy wooden barrel, molasses, tobacco, raison, nice clove and banana, fresh apple and a slight hop bitterness. The 10% alcohol is shielded nearly perfectly, as there is almost no booziness to be found.   F- Medium bodied, wonderful lively carbonation, rewarding warm-smooth mouthfeel. The best mouthfeel of any beer I've had.  O- This is the best Quad the world has to offer, and it's in my top five beers of all time. You could argue that this is beer is one of the best beers ever made. Absolutely delicious, rewarding, and almost perfectly crafted. A near perfect beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 L: Poured into a chalice. Dark ruby/amber depending on light. Two fingers of rocky tan head that laces in clumps as it dissipates. It's gorgeous.    S: Banana, citrus, dark fruit (raisins, cherries), hint of malt, some booziness, finish is reminiscent of cider or sparkling wine.    T: Malt, raisin, very light toffee, notes of banana, raisin, plum, and cherry. A touch of hops that rounds out well. Brown sugar permeates the experiences as it is finished off with a not of yeast and booze. Just a tad bit of vanilla and spice (clove mostly). As it warms you get hints of banana and more breadiness. So incredibly well-balanced.    F: Medium bodied by way of carbonation. It gets thicker the more it warms. It coats the mouth a bit and the alcohol warms very pleasantly. Excellent carbonation. Another reviewer noted that it isn't cloying, which gets it spot on. It balances well, and comes out so very smooth.    O: This is a phenomenal beer, and quite possibly the best quad I've ever had. Incredibly easy to drink. Too easy for 10%, honestly. Immaculate is the only word I can use to describe it. I'm disappointed it's taken me so long to get hold of a bottle, and I'll be getting more to keep around. You owe yourself to try this.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours a big creamy and rocky off white head. The color is very dark brown, essentially black. If you shit a light through it, it appears garnet.    The nose is raisins, phenolic spicyness, dates, molasses, banana bread.    The flavor is brown sugar, raisin bread, dates, molasses, clove, overripe banana. You can definently taste the alcohol, but it doesn't come accross harsh. Rather, it plays with and amplifies the other notes in the beer.     The mouthfeel is a smooth lightly-thick body. The carbonation is on the lighter side of medium, but it still quite prickly and builds up if you try to drink too quickly. The alcohol warmth is very noticable, but not at all harsh.     This beer is one of my all-time favorites. It is a dangerously drinkable 10 percenter that I have all but finished while writting out this review. It is one of the best beers ever made, and you would remiss if you die without ever trying it.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Bottled on 1/28/15    Pours a deep brown with noticeable amber hues and a beautiful crimson sheen when held near light; a large head of tan foam is about as close to perfection as I’ve seen on a beer, and is spectacularly retained; moderate thick, soapy lacing holds briefly where the head does relent. All-around brilliant-looking brew.    Aromas of candied figs, vanilla, plum, and toffee, all rounded with an ultra-balanced malt character; pronounced dark fruits and hints of brown sugar become more prominent on the back end; notes are all pronounced but never overwhelming.    Taste profile shows a great variety of subtle, well-rounded notes including molasses, dark fruits, raisin, plum, caramel, banana, clove, and hints of earthy spice throughout the mid-palate; bubble gum and a slight hoppiness leading through the finish that leaves a faint herbal touch.    Mouthfeel brings a medium body with heavy carbonation integrated to a great benefit on the palate; bits of spice, yeasty, and faint hops influence a uniquely dry kind of stickiness that adds weight but refrains from setting a more cloying, imbalanced tone. This is ultimately smooth, robust, very faintly boozy, and quietly deep on the palate.    A spectacular display of balance, from the depth of flavor and pure execution of aroma to the attention given to each note on the profile; an excellent quad meant to be sipped and savoured easily, with little worry of one aspect interfering with another.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip glass.   Tan head is thick and leaves moderate lacing. Color is deep garnet with some sediment. Moderate haze. This looks very artisanal.   Tastes of pumpernickel, raisin, prune, dark cherry, molasses, a hint of banana and a slightly peppery finish.   Mouthfeel is velvety with moderate carbonation. The high alcohol level is hidden beneath expanding layers of flavor.    I give this beer my full recommendation. If the sound of angels singing were represented in taste form it would be this beer.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A: Amber color with white, rocky head. The foam structure is absolutely beautiful, showing a great body.  A: Aroma is very fruity in the first sniff, along with a great scent of malt. Slightly sweet like apple or pear.  F: Bold strong malt flavor, with different levels of other flavor - British Black Tea, caramel, fermented fruit. I did not taste too much pine, hoppy flavor at all. Mostly, I tasted the full body with sophisticated multi-level scent.  M: Extra bubbly, more bubbly than I expected. Smooth in mouth, and a slightly sweet, malty aftertaste. Warm sensation in throat by alcohol, but not burning.   Overall: this is one of the bests Belgian quad I have had. I was told this is similar, slightly more fermented compared to the Holy Grail - Westvleteren 12, but this beer is a good beer to drink by itself.

Extremely malt forward and complex... best appreciated at a warmer temperature...pour two and experience a subtle opening opening of the taste profile. Wonful lacing that clings to the vessel throughout the drink. The taste of deep caramel, molasses and plank aged Gouda. Mouthfeel is full without a thick viscosity and subtle small carbonation is not overpowering but balanced.   This is an easy beer to like but it is in my opinion a well crafted Belgian Quad and as good on tap as any imported beer from Belgian. And that is a very high standard.

A: Pours a clear, dark copper to brown color with ruby highlights and very, very lively head formation leaving an initially 3 to 4 inch, fluffy, light brown head, strong retention and solid lacing.  S: Tangy/tart. Initial aromas of blueberry (at least some kind of berry), with cocoa and cookie emergent.  T: Semisweet with caramel/molasses, raisin, and walnut, as well as a bit of cocoa, tobacco, and lactic acid. Bitterness clearly present, but as a counterpoise to the malts.  M: Medium to full bodied with robust and persistent carbonation. Very, very smooth and playful.  O: Delicious and fun. Not quite a spiritual experience, but certainly in that direction.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 The colour is dark brown, the liquid clear. The three fingers head is beige and compact, and it sinks slowly to a thick lid without leaving any lacing on the glass.    The smell is strong yet smooth. Brown malts, dried fruits, alcohol, crispbread, matured cheese, roasted nuts and a hint of soap.    The taste is semi-sweet with roasted nuts, dried apples, crispbread, red berries, toffee, banana candy and passing notes of salty crackers and bitter herbs. Full Body. Hot clean alcohol in the aftertaste as well as pumpernickel, treacle, matured Cheddar, ripe bananas and caramel. The long finish is very smooth with digestive biscuits.     The carbonation is strong, the many small bubbles fresh and short-lived. The liquid is smooth but not sticky.    It is way too easy to give high scores to this kind of strong, semi-dark and rewarding beers, and I really try to balance my scores after that knowledge. Still, this is a very, very fine beer.

L: Dark brown with a ruby red tinge when held up to the light and a 1.5 fingers of off white head.  S: Dark fruits beautifully blended with a rich and sweet malt. Gave off a slightly musty smell which disappeared after it warmed up a bit.  T: Initially a semi-sweet malt-forward taste which evolves into a rich, fruity taste with hints of raisins and dates as it warms in my mouth. Finishes with a distinct brown sugar/molasses taste with warming alcohol that stings the tongue in the best way possible. Amazing.  F: Excellent strong carbonation with a full mouthfeel that isn't too heavy. Velvety and creamy. High ABV gives a nice warming sensation.    O: No wonder why this beer is so high on the Beers of Fame list. It is rich and complex but still refreshing, even at 10% ABV. At $9.99/25.4 oz bottle, it's fairly priced. Get yourself a big bottle of this and enjoy all night. You won't regret it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.75 It pours a rich mahogany color with a large ivory colored head, good retention.    It has so many fruity smells. Grape, cherry, fig, maybe some pear or apple. It’s got a strong malt presence with a nice caramel smell.    It’s sort of fruity, hints of spice with some cloves or pepper and a bit of cinnamon or nutmeg. Caramel malt taste is still there. It’s almost indescribable the amount of different tastes coming out of this beer. It’s very complex but it’s not overly complex to the point that it loses its balance.     It’s a full bodied beer, definitely getting the alcohol out of this one. It’s a little warm but not burning by any means. This would be a perfect winter beer.    This is my first Quad and I’m impressed. I’ve been a big fan of other brews by St Bernardus and this one does not disappoint. It is amazing the amount of flavors in this beer and how well they complement and work with each other. It’s a bit expensive but falls in the you get what you pay for category. I would definitely pick up a bottle of this again. A truly good experience.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This quad pours a beautiful clear, reddish brown color with a creamy, off white 2-finger head. That provides excellent lacing retention down the glass. It has a malty sweet nose with dark fruits, such as fig, prune and raisin ,as well as a dark cherry, to go along with a dark bread and a spicy, cinnamon funk. The taste is thick and creamy on the palette with a sweet caramel or toffee, some dark bread and an array of dark fruits, with a spiciness on the back end. Complex, yet well balanced, very little alcohol hotness. For my first Belgian quad, this was excellent! A full and hearty brew, not for the weak, especially if you favor this style of beer. While it's not my preferred style, it's a great departure the big hop bombs that I favor. Big in ABV and big in flavor, St. Bernadus Abbot 12 sets the bar high.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 From notes 11/2/13: Pours a dark and somewhat dull hued ruby brown producing 2 fingers of tan, frothy head that recedes faster than you would think but leaves a nice surface cap and coating of lace. Aroma is Belgian yeast, dark bread, dark caramel, dark fruits, roast and a hint of alcohol. Taste is rich dark bread, dark fruits of all kinds, caramel and molasses, Belgian yeast, pepper, spice and an alcohol note that is heavier than in the nose. Lots of carbonation. Smells and tastes great, full bodied and filling yet highly drinkable for the ABV. Very complex.

Mid-palate gives a caramel sweetness and spicy yeast that adds hints of clove, banana and phenolic notes.

Excellent lacing. Just about a perfect appearance.    S---Malts notes are predominant. Fig/raisin. Fruity, with a bit of breadiness. You can tell it's a quad.    T---Follows the nose, but is even more so. Malty. Bread/yeast are obvious. Fruitiness is not hidden either. Alcohol is noticeable, but that's just fine.    F---Lighter than expected, but still full enough. Very well carbonated.     O---World class. Without a doubt, one to drink when/wherever the opportunity presents itself.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Beautiful dark brown-red pour. Full smells on the nose and the taste palate to match. I get a bit of dark cherry.

Deep mahogany with an everlasting off white head, some chunks of lacing. Deep fruit aroma with hints of spice, bready malts and caramel sweetness. Similar to raisin bread almost. Wonderful flavor. Lots of dark fruits, bread, some cinnamon spice and some funk. Thick and creamy. Leaves your mouth warm and numb. I need a minute with this one. Top notch.

Looks like a luminous gemstone brown, with a head that's impressively tenacious for the strength. Beautiful five star glorious nose of prunes, brown bread, green apple, papaya, it's equally enjoyable to smell this beer as opposed to drinking it, where you're almost robbing yourself of the wonderful aroma by finishing the bottle.. I'm usually more into dubbels than quadrupels, this is my favorite example of the latter, and pretty much the only one I'm well familiar with that I'll readily buy. For the flavor I get this sharp round malty masterpiece, candi sugar seems to contribute but in only a supporting manner. Caramelized malt, strawberries and huckleberries, a flash of pear or mango, than the mild funk and strength show their hand but it's so balanced with a wintergreen pineapple loooong lasting but light refreshing finish, where the the subtle beta-linoleic Belgian hops respectfully wrangle in amongst the other powerful contenders. I wish I could find a British mild ale with a similar but slightly tangy zing and I'd be in heaven. In any case this is a non sour Belgian masterwork!   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 As close to a perfect beer as I could ever want and ranks #1 with me as the best beer I have ever had. Its simply a joyous event to drink this wonderful beer and I do my best to always have some on hand. By all means pick some up!

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Fresh bottle, served in a clean Chimay glass at around 55°F with a bbq spiced pork chop and sweet potato fry dinner on Independence Day in the Rocky Mountains.    Clear, dark reddish brown with burnt orange tints at the edges and ruby highlights in the light, several streams of bubbles visible, about a finger of tannish white head with some nice lacing and even some short legs.    Unmistakable, lightly fruity, malty Belgian quadruple. Hints of sweet cherry, plum, red grape and a smidgen of raisin, caramelized malts and sugar. Fresh. A little bit of mountain air and spring water, but maybe that's from the fresh mountain air and rain clouds coming in.    Same, unmistakably Belgian-y quadruple. Follows the aroma exactly, but with a little less fruit and a little bit more semi-dry red wine character (almost a hint of Cabernet Sauvignon). The spiciness of the yeast comes through very well, as does some minerality from, I can only imagine, crisp Belgian water and good barley. Pleasant alcohol warmth in the finish with a bit of sweet fruitiness and even some dry, brown (but noticeable) hops in every second or third sip.  Towards the end of the glass, there's a tinge of some, well, almost "off" note that isn't a buttery flavor, definitely not cardboard, perhaps a slight cocoa butter and dried pluot something-or-other. Interesting, not off-putting at all.    Fairly full-bodied, creamy, a little fluffy, rich but not too rich. Exactly how it should be. Scrubs the palate very well during a meal.    Overall more drinkable than I was expecting, not quite as fruit-forward or richly malty as I was hoping, yet in another way exactly what I was expecting. Pretty much perfect.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Murky rust brown color. Above medium feel with above average carbonation but it still came off light and fizzy. . Aroma is yeast,dried fruit,plums,yeast,and a grainy fruit cake like smell.   Taste had all the flavors that showed up in the aroma. Dried fruit and plums came through the most but it still was complex and very flavorful. This was a top notch beer that I will certainly visit again

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Best by 12 2021.    Huge dark fruit aroma with fig, plum, raisin, currants, light pear, some clove, cinnamon. Taste follows the nose with a pleasant and noticeable sweet character, bready whole grain malts and a balancing phenolic character that pairs well with the light touch and warmth of the alcohol. Fairly crisp and thin mouthfeel, but tons of flavor. A fantastic quad, no doubt.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a goblet.    Look - Slightly opaque deep brown amber body with a large lively long lasting thick pillowy caramel colored head. An exciting pour.    Smell - Cinnamon, pears, raisins, and apricots. Lots of light fruity notes with a bit of spice at the end.    Taste - Sweet caramel, toffee, whole grain bread, marmalade. A little zing of alcohol, but it's not overpowering. Flavor is complex and well balanced, but could have a little more pizzazz, ala Chimay Grande Reserve.    Feel - Medium body, lively carbonation, and a sinus clearing alcohol wash when swallowed. Not the best feeling beer, but it goes ok with the taste.    Overall - A full and hearty brew that isn't for the weak, but if you're a fan of strong Belgian ales, this is a prime example of the style.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with an amber tint and a medium, foamy head. Smells of toasted, dark bready malt, grains and dark fruit. Taste is being dominated by dark, bready, caramel malt, pumpernickel, grains a certain candy sweetness and dark fruits, with a hint of red berries as well: fig, raisins, red/blackcurrant, as well as the merest hint of citrus. Some estery and lightly phenolic notes of banana, clove and spice as well. Finishes quite sweet and spicey, with a strong estery/phenolic note. Thin mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation. While this does have a rich, complex and well-balanced flavour profile, it's just too sweet and phenolic for my personal taste. There's also a strong grainy note to this that almost feels lightly metallic.

Nice lacing effects.    Smells of malt, black currant, grape/wine notes.    Grape, malt, some alcoholic heat comes through in the palate. After the ale has had a chance to warm up a bit, a bit of cocoa and coffee comes out.     Lingering taste of coffee, malt in the aftertaste, with much of the fruit gone.     Very complex beer, something to develop your palate on. Worth a look, and then more.

It just does nothing for me.    ...    It is an interesting beer, yet after having had three of these over the course of over a year, I am not impressed. I had it while having an Anchor Coffee Porter (which was open and corked two days prior), and I though the Anchor porter was better.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Exceptional. Always dependable when you want an exemplary quad. I recommend going to the brewery in Belgium and staying in the bed and breakfast that once was the brewer's home.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Poured into wine glass.     A: Pours a huge head, especially for the abv. Two finger light toffee colored head sits sits over a brawny ruby colored beer. Holding it up to the light, the beer has good clarity and ample carbonation. Head retention is decent, with the large froth subsiding fairly quickly. Lacing was minimal.     S: Ah, Trappist...er...Abbey. Great abbey beer. Sweet malt, fruit candy (banana and orange taffy), alcohol sweetness, baked Christmas bread.     T: Sweet up front. Phenolic . Peppery, fruity notes intermingle with a slight herbal note. Mid palate picks up the alcohol heat and rounded fruity notes. Belgian yeast plays more here with an ever so slight barnyard and fruit candy (I get a lot of banana runt here). Malt notes are again with the slightly sweet Christmas bread. Finish picks up more of the alcohol heat with a slightly spicy/peppery note on the back end. Finish is dry but warming.     M: Lighter in body than the abv would have you believe. Fine carbonation does a great job at balancing the modest (for the abv) malt body and alcohol warmth. Balanced and light on its feet for 10%.     O: I've been drinking too much American beer lately. This is good, great even. But I feel like the subtleties compared to US beers of similar strength are a bit of a weakness. Lacks the punch in flavor that I personally have come to expect from double digit abvs.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 1 pint 9.4 ounce caged and corked bottle into a Shaker pint glass, "best by" date 24 04 21 which I interpret to mean April 24, 2021. My understanding is the date is five years after the bottling date so this beer is approximately 1 year and 10 months old.    APPEARANCE: pours a hazy, dark brown color with two fingers of tan head, world class retention, highly carbonated, there is moderate lacing on the glass.    SMELL: initially sweet brown sugar, some fruity notes of raisin or fig, the alcohol is perceptible to the nose.    TASTE: very complex, initially sweet and then fruity notes of raisins and figs, the 10% alcohol is present but well disguised and finishes with a sweet bread note.    PALATE: highly carbonated and somewhat creamy and full bodied.    OVERALL: this is a world class beer to be sure, I refuse to pay a ridiculous price for Westvlerten 12 when I can get this for $16.00 at my local bottle shop, this is a great beer for special occasions and is a great beer to share with someone, I will continue to purchase this and would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys the style.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 L: Hazy, just barely translucent dark reddish brown. Ample carbonation gives a generous foamy tan head, which dies down after a few minutes into a creamy thin film that leaves streaking lacing.    S: Cherry, plum, fig, vanilla, rye bread, mild booze, straw, clove.    T: Big pop of cherry, plum, prune, fig, and raisin upfront, followed by thick, warm, toasted pumpernickel and rye breads. Cherry and other dark fruits float throughout, as well cooked apple and pear. Like apple and cherry pie. Alcohol warmth sneaks in. Finishes shockingly dry with notes of straw, clove, coriander, and pepper.    F: Medium to full-bodied; actually, surprisingly light-feeling--at least medium, but the effervescent carbonation pushes the beer rapidly across the palate like champagne. Finishes bone dry, making it scarily drinkable for 10%.    O: A wonderful beer. World class quad. It's amazing.

Look: Dark amber color with a hint of red.    Smell: Plum and dark cherry with a tinge of alcohol.    Taste: Very complex and hard to pinpoint the exact fruit flavors but plum stands out. I also get a bit of caramel at the end. There is so little alcohol taste it's hard to believe it is 10%.     Feel: Not as heavy as you might expect, but certainly not light. A very happy medium that sticks to your tongue just long enough to experience all the unique flavor.    Overall: A very pleasant Belgian quad that I think I'll pick up 2-3 times a year during the winter months. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to try a truly quality quad.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Obviously a quality beer. The aromas are amazingly complex. Taste is surprisingly sweet but very funky from the yeast. Definitely does not drink like a 10% beer. Overall a very nice brew

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 330 ml bottle best by 1-10-20. CBF Tulip.    A: pours a deep brown with 2 fingers foamy, sandy head, and roiling carbonation.    S: cherries! Sweet, complex fruit, cherries, plums, bright, lively and sweet. Caramel and a hint of white grape.    T: mildly sweet, phenolic and fruity arrival, alcohol and chocolate toffee. Like a tootsie pop. Not as sweet as I would have expected; perhaps the least sweet Belgian dark ale I've had (which is not saying much).    M: lighter than expected; midweight and highly carbonated. Very clean finishing, remarkably so.    O: this is dangerous beer. It is loaded with complex fruity aromas and flavors. Alcohol is present, but not unpleasant. Dangerously drinkable for something of this strength. This could be a yearly tradition, for sure. Clearly a best in class performance.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 11.3 ounce bottle poured into a St. Bernardus Goblet    A: Pours a dark mahogany color, it's hazy and cloudy, head dissipated after a few minutes of retention, no lacing, lots of carbonation that creates a soapy off white colored film.     A: Lots of dark dried fruits, figs, plums, dates, raisins, toffee, Belgian yeast, slight dark red wine aroma as well, no alcohol on the nose at all, smells amazing.     T: Loads of Belgian yeast notes, malty, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, banana as well as some sweet dark fruits, apple, pear, very complex and deep, alcohol is slight there at the end and becomes more present as the beer warms, moderate amount of bitterness, finish has lingering notes of Belgian yeast and banana, very nice full flavor.     M: Full bodied with a lot of carbonation that rolls over the palate, finish is slightly dry, and there is a slight alcohol burn as the beer warms.     O: A very tasty beer, it's like liquid raisin bread with Belgian yeast added, world class mouthfeel and taste, definitely know where to go for a big beer that's a sipper.

But there was one perfumey/room cleaner aroma I got at the end of the glass that was really weird and disgusting.    Taste: malty and vinous, rich and sweet with a touch of belgian hops to counteract those notes.    Mouthfeel: no alcohol detected, smooth and full bodied. Surprisingly dry finish given all the sweetness involved.    Overall: really nice brew. Only let down was that artificial perfumey aroma at the end of the glass. Similar to westy 12 but a bit more watery and not so full flavored. I prefer Rochefort 10 to both.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 What struck me first is how similar the taste is to a Westvleteren no 12 (which I've had many times). I did not do a side by side test, but I think St. Bernadus Abt 12 is a bit more boozy and prickly than a Westvleteren no 12. In any case this is an outstanding Quadruple. If I do a side-by-side test I'll update.    Look: Cloudy dark brown with a thick fluffy mocca head.    Aroma: raisin bread, figs, very nice aroma    Taste: the flavor is sweet dark raisin bread and dark fruits perhaps figs, it's complex, and there is a soft rum like booziness.    Feel: full bodied, slightly boozy, silky

look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Look: Murky dark brown with some cola colored highlights. The head is thin and eggshell colored. The top half of the beer is semi transparent but the bottom is opaque.     Smell: Sticky sweet on the nose. Notes of fresh baked raisin bread, dried figs, dates, brown sugars, plum, light burnt bread notes, wet leaves,cinnamon, and a pronounced alcohol note.     Taste: Rum soaked raisin bread on the attack. Then the body builds with notes of date cake, honey covered baked figs, vanilla extract, cloves, musty forest floor, and pecans. The finish is dry with more baked whole wheat bread notes with a hint of molasses.     Feel: Big bodied and sticky on the palate. Boozy alcohol. Soft carbonation. Body is quenching but the finish is bone dry.     Overall: A big brew. It looks, tastes, and sits in the stomach like a whole loaf of raisin bread. It is delicious and full of complimentary notes. However, it could use a bit more carbonation. Also, it’s a small gripe but it’s a seriously ugly beer to look at. It is very heavy and I couldn’t drink it all the time but I did enjoy this one.

I guess the most impressive thing is the fact it's 10% and can also be super thin and watery. You wouldn't think this beer was 10% and for that I applaud this beer. But I would have liked it thicker such as what you'd get with blue Chimmay. I got flavors of chocolate, figs, dates, and nuts but is so watery that the flavors are subtle. All in all I would much rather have a blue Chimmay.

Flavour: Spicy malt sweetness, clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger - mollasses, dried fruit - fruitcake - huge complexity yet the body is not overly heavy - also, surpridingly little alcohol warmth given the abv.

But I'm just not into how carbonated it is. I know that's the style but it makes it feel thin to me. Maybe it's just me. Nice beer though but, looking for something less fizzy.

It’s amazing how the brewers can coax out such a depth of flavors without the use of barrels or a long list of adjuncts. Unbelievable.     Bottle aged two years in appropriate conditions, still within BB date. Dark amber, brownish pour with a sumptuous head that lingers all day.    Aroma is dried, earthy fruit - fig, date, raisin, plum - with sweet undertones of freshly baked bread sprinkled with brown sugar. Mouth watering.    Taste is spot on - fig, dates, brown bread, plum, raisin, caramel, brown sugar. Wow. True depth of character.    Thick, chewy, heavy on the palate. Warmth not heat from the ABV. World class sipper. Vanguard of the style.

Aroma: Toasted bread crust, brown sugar and a light raisin and plum Taste: Starts with a spiced, rich malt sweetness, some pear esters, then bread crusts and apple pop up on the swallow with a fairly high bitterness for the style Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with a pleasant carbonation and a slowly warming alcohol Finish: Retronasal apple and pear aromas are strong on top of a lingering toasted maltiness. Overall: Incredibly smooth and easy drinking, with the complexity of a world class quad. Multi layered malt complexity and fruity Belgian esters, with a brisk carbonation that keeps it lively without being syrupy. High alcohol comes across as a pleasant warming and not harsh. Great beer

Head retention is world class, but no lacing is left behind. Aroma is dark, roasted, nutty, bready malts with berries, yeast spice, and clove adding to the complexity. Flavor profile is bready, nutty, toasty malts. Clove, yeast spice, and berries. Wonderful complexity without being difficult to approach. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a pleasant velvety texture. Overall, a wonderful quadruple ale that provides world class complexity in an extremely approachable fashion. It's delicious through and through, providing a wonderful experience. Not a whiff of the 10% ABV shows up in the aroma or flavor profile.     Served in a Belgian chalice from a 375mL bottle.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 750mL bottle. I believe the date reads 1/3/20. So guessing this one was brewed at the beginning of 2015 making it about 2.5 years old.    Pours a very dark amber-brown color. Just slightly hazy. Large 2 finger head with great retention, infact the foam sticks around until the last sip. Thick lacing.    Smells of belgian yeast, malts, spices, and a hint of dark fruit.    Taste is loads of Belgian yeast and malts, some spices, very bready and full bodied.    Feel is very heavy and smooth. Good carbonation. Decent alcohol warming    Overall a delicious beer. A great example of the style. Strongly recommend.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 12 oz bottle poured into a Teku. Not sure of the bottle date.    Pours a dark and murky amber color. Finger head with good amount of carbonation. Some visible sediment at the bottom.    Smell is huge on the plum and dark fruit! Some nice spice in there also.    Taste is much of the same. A caramel and grape combined with plum and almost a licorice spice to it. A lovely malt flavor to it also. More dark fruits and even some apple is detectable. Lovely.    Feel is typical of a world class quad. Drinks like a meal and is a sipping beer.     Overall an incredible offering right here! Can't believe I've waited so long to try this. One of the best Quads I've had thus far and truly a world class beer.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Poured into tall pint and pours dark caramel. A ton of collar throughout the pourings and it maintains it well. A classic malt nose. I don't smell the subtleties suggested in other reviews but maybe I will be the end. At a whopping 10% alcohol, beware, cause ya can't tell! Exceptionally smooth with a really fine balance of bittersweet. Tons of efferversance throughout so a great taste start to finish. bottle says you are drinking deep from life's pleasures....well I don't want this day to end ;-)

Too many calories per bottle to pound down many brews unless your weight isn't a problem. I could drink this all the time. Malty, caramel, sweet, toffee, and a boozy finish. Beeee...uuuuuu...ti....ful.

Also taste of fruits and yeast, sweetness.     Feel: good feel, reasonably carbonated, it works for the beer.     Overall: this is a very good beer, not the best Belgian I've ever had but it's still a treat. Very smooth and easy to drink for the abv, I'll purchase again.

Pick up some raisin flavor and a hint of molasses..  F: Finishes dry with a the 10% ABV adding some alcohol warmth.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Packed with enough flavors and aromas to push this into fine-wine territory. Velvety, creamy mouthfeel with an almost burning alcohol presence that detracts a little from the spicy, fruity flavors. Dessert in a glass. The best Belgian beer I've had to date     93/100    EDIT (5/28/18):    Had on tap at Six Degrees North in Edinburgh. Raspberries up the wazoo, both in aromas and flavors, this time around. Love it. Less fluffiness in the mouthfeel, but that's ok    EDIT(10/25/18):  Finally trying this side by side Rochefort 10. Appearances are roughly the same, with marginally better head retention and lacing on the Rochefort 10. As noted last time, raspberry dominates the aromas, with some doughy maltiness and fruity yeast ester. Flavors of banana bread, caramel, fig, prune, raspberry, currant, and dusty earthiness. Killer silky mouthfeel. Overall I think this inches out Rochefort 10 thanks to its subtle complexity and balance

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This was poured into a chalice. The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a slim finger’s worth of head that quickly dissipated. There wasn’t much lacing. The smell had some sweet dark fruits - fig, raisin, prune with a light touch of warming cocoa. Light breadiness with some Belgian spices round it out. Light sweet apple comes in nicely. The taste was moderately sweet with the breadiness gracing in and around the previously mentioned flavors. Gentle sweet to spicy aftertaste slides into the finish. That "deep throatiness" I normally get seems to be contained a bit, really nice. On the palate, this one sits about a medium on the body in the front of my tongue but seems to get that "heavier" feel as it runs to the back of my tongue. Still good. Carbonation runs at a nice pace. Overall, now this is a Quad. I’d most likely say, the quad of quads, uh...hell yeah, definitely would have again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Tasted alongside the Westvleteren XII, of which this is supposedly a derivative.     L - dark brown, raisiny; creamy off-white head that dissipates quickly  S & T - raising yeasty wholewheat breaddough; raisins; honey on toast  F - not as boozy as the XII; creamy, smooth    O - this seems to be an slightly less 'full'-flavored version of the Westie 12, trading the punch-in-the-face fullness of flavors for a more harmoniously balanced brew. It's less boozy, and despite the ABV, almost sessionable in how easily drinkable it is. Solid brew, but I personally preferred the Westvleteren.    I do recommend this one.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Dark brown but looks a bit clearer than some other trappist beers I've tried, with a small foamy head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is complex and wonderfully enticing: Molasses, dark ripe berries and cherries, vanilla, cocoa, nutmeg, cinnamon, and a bit of sweet oaky bourbon come to mind. Taste follows the aromas with emphasis on the sweet aspects and the addition of a bit of astringency, and some bitterness and alcohol spice on the finish. Overall: Incredibly layered and drinkable, although I don't feel that it hides the alcohol as well as others contend.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 So--I cannot believe I haven't formally rated this brew after all this time--poured from a single-serve bottle into a tulip.    Pours a two-finger head that quickly dissipates. The lacing is fine throughout, though somewhat underwhelming. The color and appearance is otherwise spot-on for a Quad--garnet hued and hazy bordering on cloudy.     The nose is vinous and supple, with unique fruit components for the style. Berry and dried fruit are welcome and expected components, but there is a clear grape and citrus component as well. Unique and crisp to the nose.    The taste is quintessential Belgian abbey ale. Sweet fruity malts, with a strong dark fruit component, balanced by tart cherry and wine notes. And then the yeast---oh damn, the yeast. It's just perfect. I give up. You have to try it.    The mouthfeel is, i a word--balance. Thick, viscous and vinous in its initial presentation, but like other offerings from this brewer, it is just carbonated and boozy enough to keep things remarkably light for such a heavy ABV. (Have I mentioned yet that you won't notice it's 10% ABV?).     This brew stacks up quite well to the other heavy-hitters of the trappist fare. Highly recommended.

Smells very nice, getting notes of bread, banana, floral, wheat, and sugary malt. The taste is nice, some spicy notes up front with a good mix of dark fruit and some minor flowery taste and wheat. A lot of malty flavors in this one with a good alcohol bite. Overall a nice beer, a little more on the spicy side for me but a good beer.

There's a fingernail of brown forming about the size of a quarter in the middle of the chalice. The aroma is of dark caramelized malt, chestnuts, and fig. The taste is full of sweet dark malt, chestnuts, pumpernickel bread, and other sweet bready malt. The mouth is moderately chewy, dry, and warm with alcohol. World class.

I do get a minor boozey smell. The beer has the aroma of those typical malts found in Belgian style beers as well as dark fruits as well as a caramel like aroma. I can taste the booze more than I can smell it. I get a very strong taste of the dark fruits with a hint of sweetness and roasted malts. A nice feel of carbonation in the mouthfeel a little thin.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pours dark brown, cola like with one finger off white bubbly head.   Aroma has yeast, malt, sweet bread, plums, walnuts.   Taste is yeast, sweet malt, bread, walnuts, a little metallic, good thick mouth feel, peppers in the finish.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A - Murky burgundy-brown body, semi-transparent, with a very thin light tan head, which fades quickly out to a thin rim at the glass edge, and mild lacing.    S - Plum, raisins, tea, toffee and dark bread, banana and bubble gum, over a persistent boozy alcohol hit.    T - Follows the nose, opening with bubble gum and banana, moving to baked apple and toffee notes, dark fruits, bread pudding, and a slightly acidic bite, with black tea elements, in the close.    M - Surprisingly supple, a bit of alcohol warmth, some carbonation on the tongue, and a very mild drying in the close. Very easy to drink.    O - This is a beer that deserves all the recognition. Full and tasty, a big beer that does not burden, not even sticky. All that you can hope for from a Quad. Lovely.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 At 10% ABV, what should have tasted boozy was far from it, and making this extras special is that this great brew is my 350th review on Beeradvocate. I'm so glad this one marks this milestone for me...    Picked this up at a bar in Pasadena and I was so happy my son had picked it for me. It showed up as a beautifully dark beer, with frothy head and lacing that stuck to the glass all way down. The smell was fruity, without be a fruit beer, malty without being overpowering, and a light touch of hops just to let you know there was more to this beer once you would bring it to your lips. And at 10%, it did not have that distinctive tang to the nose that comes with the high alcohol content. Mouthfeel was smooth, medium-bodied and dangerously drinkable. Though there was definitely a booziness to the taste, it wasn't overpowering as other high-alcohol beers provide - it was a perfect blend of fruity taste and booze that makes me with now I had had a second one.     As far as German beers go, this might not be the best I've had, but it's pretty damn close.

The label jumps off the bottle in a bright blue and yellow with the picture of a Belgian fryer raising a glass in approval. On the back, a wonderful description of the St.Benardus Brewery as well as an overview of their traditional brewing process. Sitting by a warm fire, we poured to chilled chalices full of a smooth, weighty, deep amber/brown beer. A nice full head, full of large bubbles releasing more intoxicating aroma of baking bread, malt, and fig. Raising the glass to our nares the intense complexity of the Abt 12 begins to come alive with a bright and grainy scent that filled the olfactory with pleasure. Swigging a mouthful, the tastes of bread pudding, caramel, grains, and a hint of hops rush across the tongue in tidal wave of flavor. As we settle into the beer a pleasant, medium viscosity mouth feel is established, followed by a potent yet refreshing balance of banana, toffee, and dried fruit ester. At 10% ABV, the Abt 12 packs a hearty, warm rush in less than 12oz. Nearing the bottom of the chalice, with plenty of head still chasing the beer down the glass, the taste of black current swirls with a mixture of fresh farmhouse scent, leaving us both satisfied a mildly drunk. It is a fantastic beer for anyone hoping to enjoy an authentic, high quality Belgian beer, that would make an Abbey proud.

Cloudy dark burgundy brown in color with thick silky light tan head that withstands with good retention before slowly collapsing to an eternal foamy layer on the surface that doesn’t go anywhere until the last sip and leaving fair amount of lacing patch and spot on the glass-side.    Very inviting and enticing aroma of mellow, yet tart and sharp fruity ester with notes of ripe banana, grape, berry, fig, date, prune, and plum. There are also notes of orange peel, candy sugar, molasses, licorice, spicy alcohol, coriander spice, and peppery while malt is also there so upright with its bread, vanilla cream, caramel, and buttery toffee while hop exhibits with some earthy and herbal touch.    The taste is displayed what reflects in the aroma with all those goodness and tasty flavors ranging from mellow, yet tart and sharp fruity ester with notes of ripe banana, grape, berry, fig, date, prune, and plum, as well as orange peel, candy sugar, molasses, licorice, spicy alcohol, coriander spice, and peppery while malt is also there still so upright with its bread, vanilla cream, caramel, and buttery toffee while hop exhibits with some earthy, herbal, and bitter kick in the finish.    Full body with some bold touch through the palate but it is not that too syrupy or sticky with proper amount of body, carbonation is rather low but it is crisp enough to carry all the things well under the smooth mouthfeel. Finish is very pleasantly dry that will quickly lead to the next instant sip.    There are lots of thing going on and changing all along the tasting, from smooth to a bit sharp, from simply tasty to sheer complexity, and from good to truly great. This one is surely a must try, alcohol is well concealed too.

I can't quite see the carbonation in this dim light but I can see lots of floaties. The aroma is overall very sweet and there is lots of dark dried fruit and an alcohol hit that together reminds me of rum raisin ice cream, without the cream part. In the flavor, quite sweet but there is a red wine like bitterness that keeps that sweetness in check. Lots of dark dried raisins, figs, plums, and prunes. A very Alka-Seltzer like carbonation, tight. Which really works for this style, to me. Very dry but a little sticky on the lips, and medium full bodied. Pretty much perfection, to me.

The flavor is dominated by fig and date notes, with cocoa powder, fudge, very sweet caramel, toffee, and butterscotch. The mouthfeel is very rich and sticky. Overall I know this is a classic, but I just cannot get behind it. While I love big, bold, sweet beers, this one is somehow too sweet - like there is never enough booziness to balance of the sweet. I have loved other Quads, but this one just really escapes me.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This quad pours a nice dark chocolate cover with a huge 3 finger head and tons of sticky lacing when sipped. It smells of yeast and sweet malts. The first sip surprises: its not as tart/sweet as other quads out there (Sam Adams quad and Ommegang's Three Philosophers both empasize fruit), with a heavier emphasis on roasted malts with a slightly bitter finish. Dark chocolate malt flavor, with some nice caramel, molasses, nuttiness and plummy sweetness and breadiness from the yeast. The carbonation is high, but not as high as some other quads I have had, and the ale is rich and creamy. This is delicious, and at $11.99 for a big boy bottle, well worth the buy. There is a reason St Bernardus is considered one of the best beer-makers in the world. This one didn't blow my mind, but it was fulfilling, potable and enjoyable. If I had the patience to age my beers a little, I wonder how that might change the character. I'm told it gets better with age.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 This is my go to beer when it comes to having a great Quad (Belgium/Americans are getting there). It has a delicious faint sweet dark roasted malty taste with huge smells and flavors of fig, prunes and malt. The feel in your mouth is also very distinct as it is smooth, but thicker than most any American attempt at Quads w/ the craft beer industry boom in the United States. It is an exceptional beer with a hearty beef, chicken, pork and potatoes meal. This beer actually has more subtle dark fruit, malt and light spice flavors tastes and aromas appear as it warms from the refrigerator. Thus, it actually tastes even better then when you first start drinking it. I highly recommend this beer to Americans who want to know what a quality 'Quadruple' beer is all about. I also recommend if you are a Costco member to look for it. In the Dallas, Texas area this beer is $2 cheaper than any store I have found it stocked. In other words, this beer is a bargain at Costco...and actually anywhere you can find it is a great Belgium Trappist beer that is hard to match and compare when coming to taste, texture, smell and overall pleasure. Enjoy... prost!

Smells of caramel tarts, fig, raisins, toasted brown sugar, preserved peaches, spiced rum, candied nuts and dried vanilla.    Tastes of toffee pudding, chocolate ice cream, pecan pie, raisins soaked in spiced rum, candied walnut, browning banana and more oaken vanilla notes.    Feels big and creamy.

Poured very gently so this wouldn't overflow my snifter (I know it is highly carbonated from previous experiences!), and this yielded a very dark beer with carbonation streaming up the side of the glass. Nice 1-finger off-white head that recedes leaving nice bubbles and lacing.    Aroma is a classic combination of dark fruits - plums, figs, dates, cherries. Some dark malts, bready yeast and faint herbal hops in there as well.     Taste follows the nose - very smooth blend of dark fruits and malts. The harder water they used also makes an appearance here. Not mind-blowingly complex, but very good and smooth. Nice dark fruit characteristics and a hint of spice from the yeast.    Feel is smooth, abv is well-hidden. A bit of bite from the carbonation, but it feels lively in the mouth. Coats the tongue with delicious flavors!     Overall it's a very solid, relatively inexpensive, easy to get, yet high-quality authentic belgian quad. It reminds me a lot of the quad I made a few months ago that claimed to clone Westy 12 (got another batch of it in secondary - *rubs hands with glee*). Recommended!

Aromas of molasses, belgian yeast, fig bars and raisin.     Has a lot of complexity, perhaps overshadowed a bit by the booze within. I'm getting figs and viney notes, with firm hits of molasses, some smoked ham, plum, peated malt, and then the booze creeps in and smacks hard, ending on booze drenched grapes and some flecks of citrus.     Feel is hot, with stinging carbonation and a dry dusty finish.     Overall, St. Bernardus' Abt 12 isn't the white pony it's played up to be; rather it's a decent Quad with some interesting qualities going for it (the smoked ham, the peat, the boozy grapes). I can't say I'm a fan, but I can't knock folks who say they are. It's decent.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 2.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 2.75 Okay, I've had it but didn't remember much so, alas I had to try it again and pay attention this time. First of all it poured super foamy, probably user error. It smells pleasant, but honestly doesn't have a strong odor, looks darker than I remember. $5 for one 12 Oz bottle was a bit much, but I got 3 others just in case :) Tastes a little too much like tree bark to me. I'm sure there's a fancy way to say that, but I don't know it. Taste is the most important thing to me, so that brings it down overall quite a bit. Sort of seems kike it doesnt want to melt with my tastebids like my favorite beers do, now its tasting a little metallic. Sorry, that's the second super high rated beer this week that I wouldn't buy again, unless of course I forget again.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 One of the first craft beers I had. I had no idea what to expect on that one, simply it was tagged to check my beer list. I recall it was a shock; it was very much different to main stream and other more regular ales. Back then I had both Abt.12 and Rochefort 10 at the very same day. I recall well, I preferred the former. I would do the same experience this weekend. This one I have been cellaring for 3 years. Now on to the beer.  It poured a hazy brown color with a thick dark beige head with good retention.  Nice aroma with notes of creamy chocolate, prunes, figs, mild vanilla, some banana, cinnamon and red wine (without the alcohol).  Delicious flavor with notes of chocolate mousse, cocoa, lots of spices (cinnamon, ginger, cloves, white pepper), plums, mint, figs, molasses, grapes, noble hops, pear juice, some banana, candi sugar, raspberries, coconut, blueberries, licorice and black currants. Amazingly no evident booze, just some Brandy flavor. Dry aftertaste with a medium bitterness.  Full body with appropriate carbonation of tiny fellows. Neither syrupy nor heavy. Alcohol of 10% abv is superbly well hidden.  I love this beer, utterly satisfying. It is very complex and still the myriad of flavors are subtle enough not to overshadow each other. It does not fell heavy at all; you don’t have to sip very small quantities at a time.  I see this at the same level of the Westvleteren; I still need to drink both with the same aging and at the same time to state which one is better. Recommended.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Had this on tap in a tulip glass.     A clear dark color with two fingers of tan colored head. Lots of lacing that stayed through my entire drink.     Smells of caramel and a stronger dark type of sugar. A little spice in there too.    The caramel and sugar on the most prevalent taste with a little vanilla with it.    The feel is rather creamy but still very smooth. Rather sticky at the end of a drink.     Definitely a world class beer and something special.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours a ruddy brown color - appears clearish when held to the light. When first poured it looks like cola. Appears brown with large carbonation bubbles. Fizzy carbonation gives rise to a tan colored fizzy head. Head dissipates leaving a thin layer of tan foam on top of the beer.     Smell is very bright. Notes of sweet dried plums, raisins, brown sugar, rich dark malts, and some spice.     Taste is just incredible. Initially there is some sweet plums, prunes, raisins, dark stone fruit and brown sugar. As the flavors linger on the tongue they mellow out into a lovely array of smooth oak, dark fruit and leather and brown sugar.     Feel is spot on for a quad. Fizzy carbonation. Super smooth feel with a strong warming alcohol presence.     Overall a really nice quad. Definitely one of the best examples of the style out there. This beer is best enjoyed with cool ro cold weather to really enjoy that lovely warming feel you get sipping on this beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Very dark reddish-brown, even purple, with a massive, foamy khaki head, settling to uneven mounds. This retains a soft, tan blanket with a purple hue and some soft round hills of lace.    Smell is caramel, toasted malt, light phenolic spicy yeast, grape, pear and even orange zest with walnut.    Taste is grape, strawberry, toasty malt, caramel, graham, fig and plum. Sweet but balanced.    This has a very dry finish, but before it gets there it has a substantial, full-bodied feel and is somewhat wet.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 A semi-aggressive pour from the magnum bottle into a clear glass chalice produces a short, creamy, tan colored head that recedes but never disappears, leaving attractive rings of lace. The beer is a deep, ruby highlighted brown, with a swirl of carbonation in the center of the glass. I don't think I've experienced a more beautiful lace pattern, with swirls of more viscous foam separating itself from the rest in a spiral pattern like some sort of beery galaxy.     The first thing I get in the aroma is a whiff of pleasant DMS of a subtle vegetal quality. As I taste, and as the beer warms, the malt aromas become more rich, showcasing dark fruit and caramelized sugars. The flavor is rich, fruity and mineral-laden, with notes of plums, dark cherries, plums, black currants, caramel, and subtle hints suggestive of fortified wine. Balancing the fruity and vinous notes is an earthy bitterness that lends to the vinous notes. The ABV is hidden except for some very slight medicinal notes which complement the other flavors nicely.    This beer is living up to my high expectations. I had never seen it around here until recently, when I purchased a bottle for $12.19 (cheap!) at Front St. Market in Butte, Montana. If they have any left, then I know what I'll be drinking at Yuletide- besides my home brew.    4.75 4.75 4.5 4 4.5    Reviewed July 30, 2016

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours murky brown with two to three fingers of tan head. Distinct streams of carbonation make my tulip look like some kind of dark mass potion.    The nose gives off a big hit of sweet grape and raisin, balanced by spicy peppercorn, yeast, and malt. Always find myself sniffing the cork. The taste follows, adding rich layers of vanilla ice cream, banana chips, fig, cherry, clove, brown sugar, and rum. Mouthfeel is thick, but still carries a pleasant buzz of carbonation.     Note that despite its drinkability, this is a true sipper that only improves as it approaches room temperature. With an occasional metal tang at lower temperatures, you may find yourself overcome with despair as the last mouthful turns out to be exponentially better than the first. This beer has effectively replaced celebratory wine/champagne in my house.

Aroma - up front I get loads of fruit, prune dates fig, some grapes are all in the mix behind that is a roasy nut and caramel aroma, spices. wow just wow    Taste - up front is mostly prune and grape but not as tarty as the aroma, this is followed by a nice roasty malt and some sweet caramel, spices than go on to dominate with almost a peppery effect, and it is finished with almost a crackery yeast character. this is a very neat beer. what a beautiful quad!     Feel - Beautifuly smooth and creamy up front with a slight kick on the tongue it goes down smooth but the alcohol is apparent in the throat with a very similar effect to the wood in barrel aged beers. Very interesting beer this!    Overall - This is the type of beer that makes belgian beer special. The flavors are so wild but come together to create such a beautiful liquid that if I believed in god, I would think he himself made it. This is by far the best quad I've had to date!

Dark and creamy beer that is sweet without being too sweet or overwhelming. The high abv is noticeable, but doesn't overpower the wonderful flavors.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Dark reddish brown color with good cap and lacing.    Complex aroma of clean yeast with floral hops and more than a hint of spice.    Flavor is surprisingly complex. There is an element of dark or roasted malt yet no hint of bitterness, rather a smooth transition between depth of flavor with the lighter elements of sweet bread yeast and indefinable yet present spices. I will say dark fruits such as figs, dates or dark plums but not so much here as I've noticed in other Belgian Quads. I mean they're in there but so well blended together nothing stands out so much as everything melds seamlessly together. Flavors are consistent to the finish and linger just a bit in the aftertaste.    Medium full texture with balancing carbonation.    Ok, it's 10% which makes it whopping strong for a beer. Yet it doesn't seem so, rather a pleasant food accompaniment sort of drink with remarkably fresh vivid flavors that are not so strong as to overwhelm any but the lightest of dishes.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Drank on draft at Fugas.    A: The body is brown, black opaque with a beige thin head. No retention but some lacing.  S: The aroma is pure yeast. No alcoholic tones nor fruity profiles.  T: The taste is very rich, raisins, blueberries, blackberries and the alcoholic end to it. But very nice!  M: The body is medium to high but the carbonation seems too harsh, probably due to the bad maintenance of the keg.  O: This was drank on draft, and I have never had this beer on bottle. But if it's exactly like this, on terms of quadrupels, Trappistes Rochefort and Westvleteren are much better.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I got this bottle a few weeks ago, and it is only months fresh. Nevertheless I'll have it and compare afterwards with an aged one.    Served in a Chimay chalice, it pours a very dark brown with a two-finger head, of a light brown, with some retention.     The bouquet is very sweet.   Aromas of toffee, brown sugar, slight hint of vanilla, cinnamon, a little booze, prune and raisins.     The taste is quite intriguing.   It starts with a nice balance and notes of prunes, raisins and cherry. Short after, phenols, a medicine-like flavor arises, and the malty backbone enters mildly as well. Clove is definitely present all throughout the flavor, and so is the alcohol, which gives a bit of a wine-like taste to the beer.  The aftertaste is long and predominantly sweet, it lingers very pleasantly. Medium to full body, very smooth. Superb balance.    I'm eager to taste how this beer ages. As of now, the phenols and the alcohol are very high.   Excellent beer notwithstanding.

Very good rounded taste on this beer the taste is just amazing.everything I feel is done right with balancing the flavours, the high alchol is very little noticable in this beer    O: Nothing more to say than this is one of the best quadruples that is . A true enjoyment to drink this beer. Absolutelly delicious.An amazing beer   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Appearance: Dark amber/light chestnut body; medium frothy off-white head, long lasting, excellent lacing when poured into a Chimay chalice.    Smell: dried fruit; alcohol; light hops; smells great    Taste: sweet, wine-like flavors dominate right off the bat; follows through without a lot of change; finishes semi-sweet; delicious    Mouthfeel: creamy with a lot of carbonation    Remarks: very good Quad overall; I'll definitely buy again.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 A- Pours a dark caramel colored shade of brown. This one was a gusher, and the bottle exploded everywhere, so there's an enormous amount of head on this pour specifically.    S- Dried fruits, hints of alchohol, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg.     T- Follows the nose, with the sweetness being fairly subdued. Hides the alcohol extremely well, with a good malty backbone to the taste.    F- Medium body, with lots of carbonation as stated in the appearance. YMMV.     O- This beer is definitely one of the better quads out there. Not my favorite, but definitely better than the Rochefort 10 due to less of an alcohol bite masking the flavors.

Dark stone fruit and caramel malt aromas followed by spice and lite clove as liquid warms; add banana and caramel candy nose. Flavors of figs, prunes, caramel malt, chocolate syrup on banana middle; dark cherry cordial yields to lite clove, tobacco and fudge finish. Medium plus mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A world class quad - complex tapestry of fruit/yeast/malt and candy flavors.

Overall: An intensely sweet beer, with a fizzy/sparkingly  backbone. There is tartness pushing against the sweetness,  but I was actually looking for a bit more "bitterness."   A very "festive / celebratory" beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 One of the great quads. Typical dark fruit aromas & flavors with a big malt presence. Out of the more famous quads, this one seems the harshest with the alcohol more evident in the taste.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured 330ml bottle into chalice. It is a deep, dark amber brown. A thick 2 finger khaki head remains for the entire session and leaves spotty lacing on my glass. The aroma is prominent with dark fruits, yeast, and some all spice baked into bread. Very light toffee and caramel notes. Flavor is big on plum and fig with yeast coming in at the finish. It has a bready sweetness with some allspice or cinnamon along with some toffee flavor. Not any really chocolate like in the Roch 10 I had earlier. Medium feel with prickly carbonation. Easy drinking with some warmth. Very good and I do believe that this should age well.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 L: pours light brown,with a finger if off white head  A: dark fruit juices, Belgium yeast with an overlying sweetness  T: the Belgium yeast pops right away for me.

L: Tranlucent brown with caramel head. Looks beautiful.   S: Bready, some tanginess, maybe some mild spices but not overpowering at all.  T: This was my "5". The aroma combines with the taste to produce a beer that's so thoroughly simple, yet complex at the same time. I enjoyed this beer the first time with a steak, potato, and some fresh-baked bread and I was in heaven 2.0 - It's flavor is a mixture of some natural sweetness from raisins, maybe dates, cinamin, and maybe a touch of clove. It's yeasty malt and just goes does well and given the high ABV, is just delightful.  F: It's not overly effervescent but not flat by any means. It's heavy, yet light, and the only reason I marked it down a half a point is that it is a little hot. No so much that it was unpleasantly so, just that I could feel it.    O: Overall a word-class Belgian beer worthy of recognition. Not so much that anything heavily stands out, but rather that is so good withOUT anything standing out. It's even better with the right food so watch your pairings. Don't go trying to drink this with you sushi or something ridiculous. This is a hearty, delicious meal in bottle as it is and deserves to be paired with a meat and potatoes (or brown rice of pilaf) meal - or if it's not mealtime, stick to the best cheese, quality sourdough breads and pretzels, and maybe some figs or other dried fruits. In other words, don't do anything to wreck your palate because you don't want to miss a single chug of this fine drink to any pickles, citrus, or wasabi.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 Learning much from the Trappists, St Bernardus produces only a few ales... but probably with an average close to excellent. (I've have 7 of St Bernardus' 11 listed on BA.) Is St. Bernardus the Trappist brewing in commercial form ? Probably yes... but that is why their ales are so good.    12 is so well made and so highly regarded, it doesn't need my review. But even better than Chimay Blue, I can transcend this quad's bubbles to find a truly great ale inside.    Reviewed in Roger Protz' "300 More Beers To Try Before You Die", a sequel to his CAMRA classic. He spends two full pages on the brewery's 3 most popular ales and its relations with the Westvlerten Trappists.   MJ's "Great Beers of Belgium" puts a brewery's beers in perspective to one another and said 12 is "almost ebony in colour, even bigger and more assertive, like a warming coconut brandy."   12 also is reviewed in "The 1001" and deserves to be there.  Truly, one of the great beers of the world.

Smell is malt heavy with some sweetness behind it, along with a big floral hit, dark fruit presence and a hefty dose of hops. Taste is phenomonal and everything you expect from this style. Strong dark fruits up front with plum, fig, raisin, red grapes, peaches, nectarine. Holy candied malt this is a lip smacker. Caramel, butterscotch candy, vanilla, clove, nutmeg, grains, baked bread crust, grape must, straw, banana and hops make for a tasty and complex flavour bomb of a brew. Finishes extremely clean and crisp with the alcohol presence being scarce, making for an easy drink. So glad to have finally tried this and look forward to another bottle in the future. Enjoyed and recommended with a rustic dish.

Lot's of dark fruit, plums , bubble gum. very nice.    Taste= very carbonated, plums, very malty. not overly sweet. you can't really taste the booze for being 10 percent.    This beer is a classic for a reason. it is the host HAD QUAD in this site. I personally think I would prefer the Trois Pistoles from Unibroue. But is this is still a superior brew. Cheers!!!!!!

The taste was Belgian in style but was smooth. Fruit certainly present. The Mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it's definitely worth a try.

Tasted like honey, a tiny amount of grape and a healthy but not overwhelming amount of wheat.... this beer knew how to be just what it needed to be.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 L) Deep chestnut brown, hazy, bubbly off-white head. Yeast in the bottom.    S) Very fresh fruity tones, a bit yeasty. Not boozy at all considering the ABV.    T) Deep plummy fruit flavours, malty, a bit sweet, just a bit of rum booziness maybe, but very smooth.     F) Very easy drinking, mild carbonation. No real alcohol burn. Fabulous.    O) Very easy drinking, flavours are not complex but very enjoyable. Very very good.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Malty with a lot of molases up front. Same goes for the nose. Brown sugar with a lot of earth. Hint if coriander in there too. Fantastic.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 A - Heavy pour into a snifter erupted in foam. I'm fearful that this may be infected. Appearance is extremely dark brown with overwhelming froth.    S - jungle juice. Seriously. This smells like plums, and grain alcohol.    T - tons of dark fruit. Plums, figs, grapes, yeasty and malty too. Taste every bit of 10% if not more. No detectable hop presence.     M - very carbonated and filling. No complaints.     O - "Big" is how this is best described. Just a big, big malty quad and I find it delicious.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 750ml bottle that's been sitting in my wine fridge for a couple of months.     Poured into a chalice. A dark, murky, port-like red. A decent finger and a half of tan head dissipates quickly.     I get cherry, clove, raisin, brown sugar, maybe even a touch of orange on the nose. Complex.    Rich and bold flavor profile. Effervescent mouthfeel smooths out a bit as it warms. I get clove, medicinal cherry, a nice bready backbone. A little hot from the alcohol. This one will sneak up on you at 10% ABV.    Overall, a classic Quad - certainly one of the best I've had. As far as dark Belgians go, I'd probably reach for Gulden Draak and Rochefort 8 before this. This is just a touch more earthy and medicinal.

I am not the biggest fan of Trappist beers but I thought I needed to try this since it is so highly regarded. Dark brown color, short head. Aroma is brown sugar, raisins, pretty nice. Flavor is more of the same and the alcohol is very well hidden.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 I've had this beer a hundred times, but for some reason it took me forever to review. Beautifully bronze color and cloudy with thick head. Aromas of grape, fig, malty sweetness. Tastes of fig, peppery bread, fill bodied, rich, creamy, slightly dry aftertaste. Always a favorite. Always delicious.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.75 Dark dark brown body, beautiful, dense foam. One sip and my head is already feeling like "whoa". Taste is beyond clean, I was actually really scared try this one, thinking it would be a malty overload or something. Highly carbonated. It's hard for me to pin point what exactly I'm tasting, it kind of is lost in the carbonation. Overall something I would drink again.    As posted on the bottle, "Bringing heavenly nectar within reach" Cheers.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a large pint and 6 bottle, have no idea what 17.86.19 is, but it's a date haha. Pours a dark brown beer, really bubbly foamy huge head, lots of carbonation and mini bubbles rising, which settles into a slightly pillowy but very foamy finger in the glass. Lacing is very sporadic. Smell is phenol, astringent, clean, pale, Belgian yeast. Really nice clean but toned down smell, very sophisticated. Taste is a grainy, pale, malty, extremely refreshing gulp. The alcohol doesn't come through in the flavor, but soon enough you can feel it in your face like wine, quite warm and hardy of an ale. Cheersabrewski, it's cool to have one of the more renowned ales of the style as my introduction to Quads. As it warms it takes on an almost wine-like alcoholic taste. Very warm beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 L: Dark brown, with ruby red coloring on the edges. Has a small mocha colored head, leaves a little lace in the glass. Relatively transparent for a dark beer. Lots of carbonation apparent.  S: Very sweet aroma, with a bit of heat from alcohol. More specifically, smells of dark malt, and the aroma is not overtly complex.  T: Malts really come in full force in flavor. Tastes of dark chocolate, though it is milder than a porter or stout. Slightly fruity, typical dark dried fruits of the style. There's fig and raisins. Despite a very robust flavor it is not at all overpowering. Really no alcohol present in the flavor either.  F: Body is full, plenty of carbonate adds some fizz to the mouthfeel. Drinks very smooth, goes back very easy.   O: Pleasantly surprised by this beer. I am a fan of this style but I didn't realize how much til I tried this one. Kicking myself for not trying it sooner.

Mouthfeel: Very smooth and creamy, medium carbonation with no bite from the alcohol.    Overall: Smooth and nicely carbonated. A bit heavier than expected, much like a stout.
