look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bottle at 45 degrees into a pint glass,    Look: Pours a dark brown, opaque color with a good to moderate amount of foamy head that lingers.  Smell: The smell is heavy and of earthy, yet citrusy and sweet nectar.  Taste: The taste is bitter and hoppy, yet heavy and with enough malty sweetness to perfectly round out the flavor.  Feel: The mouthfeel is heavy. The beer is well carbonated but heavy and oily for an IPA. This hides the alcohol well.    Overall: This is an excellent American IPA. Strong, heavy, and flavorful. Not a sessionable IPA by any means, but this one will kick you with enough hops and flavor that you won't need to come back for more.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 12oz can poured into a pint glass    L: Amber and Red. Definitely a beer. Foamy head that falls Pretty quickly  S: Hops and yeasty/bready smell. A little sweet  T: A little pine and caramel, but not as sweet as the nose would suggest. Not too too hoppy but there is a slightly bitter finish. Can't taste the alcohol (which is par to the course for a 7.2% for most IPAs  F: A little denser than some IPAs but that might be because I am more used to the crisp fruity ones. Feel is good. Carbonation doesn't have much bite, just enough. Perfect for an IPA that isn't juicy.   O: Not my favorite but it is pretty great. Cheap considering the quality; in my area it is about $17US for a 15 pack and it may become a mainstay in my fridge.

Big pine dominated hop aroma, along with some caramel sweetness.     A nice melding of malt sweetness and hop flavor on the front end. A mix of caramel and pine/earthiness. Bitterness is surprisingly soft, but it does have a lingering bitter finish.     Medium body and carbonation. No astringency, very slightly warming.     A nice IPA with a strong malt backbone. Tastes more like IPAs used to take - nice to try something that isn't overly fruity. Need to try this alongside Bell's 2 Hearted given their similarities.

Rocky head at first that gets foamier as it settles.   S: Floral hops with grapefruit and maybe some caramel. Nice aroma overall, about what I expected.  T: Getting the hops on the nose while the foam from the head creates a pleasant creaminess to go with some malty notes and caramel. Some slight bitterness on the back end, but not as bitter as a lot of IPAs I've tried around this abv. Drier on the finish.  F: Good level of carbonation balanced with the bubbly foam of the head. There is a perfect heaviness to the feel of this beer.  O: Definitely a solid IPA but not mind-blowing or anything. I can see why a lot of people like it, given that there are no real weaknesses of this beer and it is very well priced in my area. I would have no qualms with drinking this regularly.

(Blind Pig is up next at No. 16 - anyone care to help me out with that one?). This reminds me of Two Hearted with flowery hops and hints of citrus and pine. It's a solid beer and if I run across a 15-pack for 15 or 16 bucks in the future I'll bite.

T---Very well balanced between hops & malts. It finds the fine line so many IPAs miss. Taste is just like the smell. Tropical fruit, mild pine and molasses.    F---A little sticky, but not too much. Thick & meaty for an IPA, I suppose the maltiness provides that.     O---Damn fine beer. I'll keep an eye out for this one again.

Some lacing sticks throughout    S: Fresh citrus, lemons, oranges, maybe pomelo? Oily hops, woody, floral and an almost caramel smell adds some weightiness    T: A hoppy beer that has just enough control to maintain balance. The caramel maltiness and a certain breadiness harmonizes with the woody hops very well.    O: This beer encapsulates autumn for me. It has some heft for an IPA, giving some warmth for when the days get chilly. The taste somehow resembles the leaves changing colors. There's still some of the brightness and bitterness of green, but it's been mellowed out and a rich orange has settled in. Easy to drink, an exceptional IPA in my book.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12-oz. bottle poured into a 16-oz. mug, an easy pour produced a finger sized off white head with stringy lacing.   The head retreated to a cap 1/3 the way down.  Amber-gold with slight haze, looks light amber-yellow in front of light.  Smell features fruity and herbal hops with toasted biscuit malt.   Taste has semi-sweet caramel malt up front as citrusy hops bitter the middle. The finish is semi-dry as the malt fades and the piney hops take over. There is a peppery bite at the end that lingers.  Medium-rich mouthfeel with abundant carbonation, alcohol is noticeable yet the peppery taste is balanced with the piney/citrusy hops.  A happy revisit, this was one of my 1st IPAs years ago, malty and hoppy, balanced yet full of taste.  Easy drink (be care full) despite high ABV and hop flavors from all angles.

I can see how some people give this a review of 4 or more stars. If you like the full malt ipas, this would probably be something you would enjoy. Certainly not as much as Lagunitas Maximus or some of its contemporaries, but still. For me, however, maltiness needs to be offset bye a relatively complex hop character, where this one is a one-note hop character. It satisfies, and is a bargain at around a buck a can, and I have enjoyed it on many occasions. If I were going to an IPA tasting with hop connoisseurs, however, this would not be one that I would consider bringing. But if you like the heavy malt high alcohol ipas, you can certainly try this, and your rating May well be higher than mine.

While this IPA may not stand out of the crowd of iPas today given how many extreme and experimental ones are out there, I consider it to be a master class example of balance. Founders is well known for the all day session IPA, but I consider this to be a great EVERYDAY IPA. It's such a great value at under $20 for a 15 pack, and never disappoints. I also appreciate how clearly they show the date that it was canned/bottled on. Too many breweries either don't disclose that, try to hide it, give you a best by date, or want you to decipher some Julian code printed in black ink on a brown bottle. Look: a nice golden hue. Much darker than a lot of iPas (especially west coast ones) with a good bit of head. Smell: a bit of piney hops and some fruity type aromas. Taste: amazing. Nice and hoppy with a dry finish, a tiny bit of fruitiness, and no discernable alcohol. This is a crazy refreshing ipa consider it clocks in at 7.2.....probably even more refreshing than the all day IPA or any other session one. The sturdy background of malt adds a good bit of crackery bready feel to it. Feel: refreshing all around. Good bit of carbonation without being overly carbonated. Thin enough that it goes down easily but not thin the point it's watery. Overall: I get why some may be underwhelmed with this beer when they've heard nothing but hype and try to compare it to some hard to find world class IPA, but looking at in the right perspective of a fairly standard, well made and balanced IPA at a good price it doesn't disappoint in the least.

OCCASION: A nice baseball weekend ends with the Cavs eliminating the Pacers--and a beer that I have meant to experience for a while... GLASSWARE: Corsendonk tulip... pours a dark amber body animated by a swirling cascade of effervescence... a three-fingered head stands proudly as a thick mesa centering an even screen of white bubbles... a real looker.... that textbook Centennial aroma--pineapple, mango, lemon, orange amid a bouquet of spring flowers--mingles with mild spices to balance dankness and fresh-baked bread in an IPA that invites the first sip quickly... and that sip is grounded in a thick, almost syrupy draw, coating the throat thoroughly... creamy and smooth--worth savoring... at 65 IBUs, not the tooth-ringer as expected... still, a drinkable, mild 7.2% ABV... the flavor profile is sweet, almost like a sugary brown, with a thicker blanket of malts grounding the aromatic hops... I get some lemon, grapefruit, and honeysuckle... some boozy funk also adds a dimension that makes this chewy... as Founders go, another winner, and one that allows the drinker to indulge in a singular hop's offering... sticky sweet, and one I will seek in fifteen-can packages in the near future...

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Nice IPA, amber color with some head and some lingering lacing. Smells of floral and citrus hops, tastes the same along with some biscuit and malt. Finishes somewhat bitter although quite mild and not unpleasant. Mild carbonation that fades as the beer warms. Thin, surprisingly smooth mouthfeel. A nice IPA to drink but not quite what I would call “sessionable.”

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 I didn't realize in this review that it was an IPA and not an APA so I judged it as an APA.    Look: Amber and clear with a nice and tall head that leaves large lace and large bubbles as it dies down. The head of a DIPA but the body of an APA.    Smell: Orange, plum, pine, and barley packing a good American pale ale profile. There's also a bit of a sticky stink to it if you smell it too long and it's not light and bright but still smells great!    Taste: Actually kind of malty and yeasty for a pale ale. The thing I notice first is the crackeriness from the malt followed by an exceptional sweet plum taste and a very slight yeastiness. It's not bright and citrusy like your typical bright west coast IPA but it's definitely still very sweet and fruity.    Feel: Surprisingly crisp like a lager but also very sticky sweet. The finish is probably the weakest part of this beer. While it's enjoyable to drink the only thing that lingers around is a sugary sweetness but it lacks a big defining aromatic note. IBU is higher than typical APAs but the sweetness keeps the perceived bitterness much lower than SNPA.    Overall: I got this on clearance at Kroger for $4.50 for a 6-pack and it was a steal at this price. At regular price I'd probably go for the cheaper and more widely available Sierra Nevada Pale Ale but this beer is an excellent choice if you're tired of the same old. The finish needs a little more depth than just sweetness but it's still pretty high class!

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Great brew through and through. Pours a beautiful amber, and smells of a floral bouquet soaking in citrus infused malts. Taste is similar to the smell, strong in personality, yet very light in the mouthfeel. This makes it a great IPA for drinking as the resinous maltiness doesn't accumulate after your second beer, like in most other IPAs. Staple to the IPA style.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a deep amber, coppery coloration with a medium, fizzy head. Smells of caramel, biscuity malt, orange rind and pine. Taste follows the note, being driven by caramel, biscuity malt and hoppy citrus notes of orange rind and tangerine. Quite resinous, with a strong pine note as well. Finishes with a medium bitterness and more pine coming through. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. This has quite a resinous character and a very nice malt/hop balance. Very nice east coast IPA.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Clear amber with one finger of white head. Nice array of lace.  Smell is floral and resinous.

Taste is sweet, slightly salty, with hints of alcohol again. Medium to full malt body, plays nicely with the hops. Carbonation is nice and sparkling, but not too fizzy. Very nice. Complex, yet easily drinkable. Very malty.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Pours a hazy copper color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of spicy hops, citrus hops, hint of piney hops, alcohol, sweet malt, hint of yeast, and slight tea. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level and an elevated bitterness. Tastes of spicy hops, citrus hops, hint of piney hops, alcohol, sweet malt, slight earthiness, and a hint of yeast. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Beautiful amber color. Thick, foamy, off white head that lasts forever. Pronounced lacing. Fairly strong carbonation. Hoppy, with prominent orange flavor lasting through the finish. Smells like an IPA, nothing special there. Not as alcoholic tasting as some IPA's, despite it's 7.2% ABV. Very drinkable, everyday IPA. Everyday, but not ALL day, unless you want to go to the floor.     This has nothing to do with taste, but the bottle is a fairly unique squatty style with a pretty label. You can't judge a beer by its bottle or label, but it is fun presenting something aesthetically pleasing and unique to guests, knowing the beer inside is quite good.

The beer itself is quite excellent, with a good smell of hops and malts and an even better taste, but the feel of the beer and its look are perhaps what set this apart from most other IPAs. A very good IPA, and one of my go-to beers for the style.

Taste is a mess of bitter pungent hops, dank, stone fruit, citrus, floral, minerals, grass, vomit, some metallic, very muddled. Very bitter lingering aftertaste. Resinous feel, medium body. I could skip this one.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.5 From the 12 fl. is. bottle that was bottled 11/17/17. Sampled on December 27, 2017.    It is a very nice looking beer with its orange-amber clear appearance and foamy off-white head.    The aroma brings out an inviting, teasing orange or tangerine fruitiness with a kind of sweet white bread undercurrent.    The body is in the medium range. Comfortable on my tongue.    I get a boastful orange and tangerine presence in the flavor too as I did in the aroma. A kind of mild sweetness leading to a moderate bitterness to end. It's the kind of modern, hoppy IPA I could drink often. I'm surprised it took me this long to review it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 For an ale with a moderately high ABV, Centennial is as easy to drink and enjoyable as session IPA, which can get you in trouble ordering a third. An orange to copper color should clue you in that this IPA is full of pine, brown sugar, caramel, and tangerine flavors. Nice amount of suds with intricate lacing as you empty the pint. I brew with Centennial hops at home and am assuming the name reflects a single hop used for both bitterness and aroma.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 This was my go to IPA back in Michigan. I could drink this pretty much everyday and enjoy every sip.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 This is quickly becoming a go-to beer for me when I can find it. Unlike many other IPAs, it pulls off a strong but balanced flavor profile.     The reddish copper color isn't much to speak of, but the aromas hit hard right away: so much pine it's almost as good as smelling trees; caramel; orange and tangerine. This is roughly the same order in which I found the tastes to hit me as well: resiny hops; caramel, brown sugar, and biscuit malts; a light and zesty bitterness. Nice oily, but smooth and balanced feel.     This is not just a medium-intensity IPA. It suggests a strong double, a citrus zinger, and a Sam Adams all in one glass. The interplay is quite tasty, not to mention impressive for what I assume is a single-hopped brew. And somehow, on top of all this, it's dinstictive.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured out of a 12 oz can into one of my pint glasses, this beer pours a clear copper color with a huge, slightly off-white head that's well over an inch this when first poured. This head has excellent retention. Good lacing here too. Aromas of some lightly toasted, slightly biscuit malts along with a big floral and citrus hop presence. The taste is pretty similar, with lightly toasted, somewhat bready, caramel malt sweetness that gives way to a nice floral, citrus, and piney hop bitterness. Good balance of flavors here. This is not overly bitter the way some IPAs are. And don't get me wrong, I enjoy very hop bitterness forward IPAs a lot too that are very aggressively hoped, but I also can appreciate a good IPA that takes a more refined, balanced approach with the its flavor profile. And that is the case here. Has a crisp, slightly oily, yet smooth and decently frothy, medium bodied mouthfeel. Has a clean finish and a just slightly dry aftertaste. An excellent beer all around here.    Eric

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Golden brown, creamy heady with a clingy lace. Aroma is inviting, soft floral hops folded with layers of orange citrus. Taste is along the lines of a very old school west coast IPA - biscuity malt (fairly sweet), fair amount of alpha oils dancing around, vague remnants of those citrus flavors from the nose, vinuous hops. Finishes chewy instead of bitter. All-around good beer, but lacks complexity and a little malty for my own preference.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Beautiful clear deep amber gold color with bountiful cap and good lacing.    Aroma of a floral garden located in the midst of a citrus grove. There's a touch of conifer in the background but that may be my imagination. There is a muted heavier presence which I presume is the malt.    Surprisingly malty on entry. I say surprising because I was really expecting a hop first hit but that didn't happen until the liquid nectar hit the back of my tongue where hops sprang forth is a most pleasant way. Hop muscles are being flexed but it's more like runners than wrestlers, a light, smooth flowing of hop flavor that builds up to but does not cross over inter bitterness. I could drink this all day but at 7.2% don't know how far I'd get.    Full bodied malt texture that is substantial without being heavy and enough carbonation to keep things balanced.    Perfect swing and a hole in one, this is an outstanding brew. Complex, well crafted, beautifully balanced, think I'll have another.

Bright clean nose, floral and citrus with a bit of malt behind the hop. Nice hop flavor, lightly citrus primarily with a nice caramel malt back. Not as big a flavor as many American IPAs but certainly a nice crisp beer. Mouthfeel is a little thin for an IPA in my book, but that also means it can't be accused of being overly syrupy and you can certainly see a handful or more of these on a warm summer day. Overall a strong IPA that has the kind of broad appeal that makes it perfect for putting out at a BBQ. And with 15 packs of cans going for $17 (and that's out here on the west coast, all the way across the country) it's easy to see how this could become a staple for any beer fan.

When it pours it leaves a bit of a frothy head, which I found to be pleasing. The aroma was a light delicate hop scent, making it tantalizing. The taste had a slight non-overbearing flavor, very pleasing actually. It is truly a decent brew, especially for the price which brings great value to the quality that you are getting.

This sample was two months past the canning date, which may have been the reason for the muted hop aromas and flavors I experienced. Even so, there was quite a bit of resiny bitterness to balance the sweet, almost caramelly malt presence. finish is dry, with some lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue. An excellent beer, and great with a burger.

A: Pours a slightly hazy, amber to light copper color with an aggressive one and a half inch tan head with good retention. Impressive Belgian lacing throughout.  S: Aromas of sugar cookie, peach, kiwi, and lemon, interlaced with caramel, biscuit, and pepper.  T: Follows nose: Lemon and orange citrus, blended satisfyingly with flavors of caramel and mineral water; horseradish like sweet bitterness.   M: Medium bodied with strong carbonation.  O: A extremely well-balanced, complexly flavorful American IPA. Truly top of the line. Will drink, serve, gift.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 This is almost everything I want and expect in an ipa. Crystal clear copper body with big white head of foam that leaves excellent lacing behind. Smell is the week point if any... mostly pine with some malty back. Taste reminds you quickly that it's an ipa but reassures that it's definitely NOT a hop bomb. Well rounded with some caramel malt dry bread and then pine with bitter on the tail. Feel started pretty sticky but thinned out. Not my favorite style but I'd drink this one again. The higher abv is also well hidden.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.25 | overall: 3 Look - Pours a clear amber color with three fingers of eggshell colored head, great retention and sheets of lacing.  Aroma - Citrus, grass, zest, grainy.  Taste - Straightforward, citrus up front, bitterness is relatively high, a quick note of pine, malt is thin, grainy and low in sweetness.  Feel - Medium bodied, sharp carbonation, dry, chalky.    Overall - A fairly standard IPA.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 The appearance is a orange amber colored body with a small one finger off white head that dies within ten seconds. Some minimal lacing follows and no carbonation is seen. The smell has the hops in the front with some citrus following nicely. A bit of honey comes out as the beer warms. The taste is centered around the hops and a bit of pine comes out. The citrus comes out more so in the finish. Malts come out slightly. The palate is about a medium with an average carbonation. There is nothing out of sorts, not dry or wet, just good. Overall, this is a good IPA. The ABV is hidden well. I would definitely have it again.

The beer pours a bright reddish copper color with abundant khaki head and good lacing. Lacing coats the glass and a full film of head remains as the beer is consumed. The aroma is old school pine and citrus mixed but a bit muted by modern IPA standards. The taste is malt sweetness up front with citrus and pine coming in for the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with plentiful carbonation. The finish is mostly dry with a little hop oil & residual malt sweetness keeping it from being totally dry. Overall, very good. This is a beautiful, easy drinking beer.

Feel: Smooth crisp IPA with good carbonation.     Overall: I've never seen an unfiltered IPA before. I wish more breweries would make one. This is a good beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This beer pours a deep amber color that almost resembles caramel. There is lots of chill haze and a two finger, dense, foamy off white head. Retention is excellent and there are many hanging rings of lacing left around the glass.    The smell is orange, citrus, pine, herbal earthiness, as well as sweet and bready malts. Very well balanced.    The taste is the same. Again very flavorful with a good deal of balance. The hops are the star, but are supported wonderfully throughout by the malts.    Feel is medium, but the crisp and dry finish helps it come across as a bit lighter.    Overall this is a very good beer. Reminds me of Two Hearted in that it's a hop forward beer with a huge dose of classic hop flavor, but is balanced well by the malts without coming across too sweet or malt heavy.

Smells like classic Centennial hops, utmost fruity of ripe oranges, coated up by lemon zest and a good amount of toffee malts. A herbal whiff enriches the orange impression, which is highlighted on the nose throughout.    Drinks soft and refreshing with a steamlined, thirst quenching hop dryness during the finish. This puts many new wave ipas to shame in regards of how well this is build, with a simple, but intriguing and well working hop profile.    Orange covered malts upfront, which soon develop a crisp, herbal hop dryness, getting soothed by sweet caramel malts from the get go. The beer turns dryer and more herbal during midpalate, with a sparkly effervescent undertone muting the malts. Finishes sweet on the malts with a touch of earth and a long lasting, prominent lemon dryness, enhanced by an orange hull note.    Wow, this is drinking incrediby great. Fruity, sweet and hoppy dry, this hits every mark I could expect from a classic Ipa. Clean and utmost smooth on the palate, this reminds me of a well made german Bock, in terms of not being able to stop drinking, once started. The late earthen undertone does a lot to my perception of the beer, since it strengthens both, hops and malts, creating the most subtle and well working gateway to create an intense, harmonious flavor profile.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pretty good but was expecting more due to all the great reviews.   S: Light, fruity, floral, piney nose.

But I've had lots of balanced IPA's lately and I find myself wanting something bold. Don't get me wrong though, his is a good IPA.

Average head with lots of bubbles streaming up. Lots os great lacing left behind.    Aroma is hoppy and floral. Not too complex to be honest.     Taste follows the nose at first. Yet maltier than I was anticipating. The malts blend with the hops well and overall the taste is better than the smell. I do not taste booze at all.    Feel is medium weight and heavy carbonation.     Overall a decent IPA. Pretty predictable-- nothing special. It is very pleasant to look at but doesn't taste too great.

This IPA has a moderate aroma of Centennial hops, and a bitter hoppy flavor that has less of the flowery character that is common in US IPAs. With all that, the beer doesn't have a flavor I find to be outstanding.

This is my first taste of Founder's and one that I fully expected to enjoy based on its high rating. Boy, was I wrong. My bottled on 3/1/2017 beer was actually unpleasant and difficult to finish.    It started off promising with its beautiful, orange hue, and strong head hiding a pleasant aroma of mild, juicy fruit gum and pear. Though, there was a very slight hint of ashtray, too. The promise was quickly broken as none of the aroma came through in the flavor. Instead, I experienced an unpleasant, lingering bitterness after the cloying, dirty, and distastefully dry mouthfeel that reminded me of diapers.    I am an IPA fan, no doubt. I have my favorites, of course, and many that I consider decent selections for the style. Founder's Centennial IPA joins the ranks of those scraping the bottom of the barrel, which is just baffling considering the high BA rating. What gives? Bad bottle?

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Man, this sure is a great beer. Pours like you would expect of an IPA, a golden orange color that's pretty clear. Nice 1-1.5 finger of head. The smell is ROBUST!! So fresh, so inviting, makes you want to dive right in and take a sip. Strong floral and citrus notes, really an amazing aroma. The taste is right on par with the smell, it definitely does not let you down one bit. This beer is like the feeling you get biting into a perfect nice juicy fruit, incredibly fresh and tasty, crisp. Lots of citrus for sure in the taste along with the floral qualities. Sweet, but not overly sweet. A nice simple hop punch, mild-medium bitterness that makes you want to keep on taking sip after sip. The mouthfeel on this is so smooth, this beer goes down easy... One of my favorites. It's a damn shame I can't get it where I live, but everytime I leave state I check for it and make sure to bring some home with me if I find it. Excellent beer.

The aftertaste begs you for more and it's hard to stay away from this brew for very long.

Smell and taste are of light floral & pine, citrus & mango sweetness & a touch of sour, well balanced malt, almost no bitterness on the finish. Nice smooth mouthfeel. 7.2% ABV. Very nice IPA!   
look: 4.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 On tap:  Pours an amber orange, lasting cap of head, amazing lacing!    Nose is hard to distinguish, in this setting. Generic floral bitterness- re-review necessary here.    Taste has a mildly caramel malt note, slightly copper-like when combined with the initial hop bitterness. The hops are classic pith and pine, leaning towards the latter. A nice drinkable heft that isn't near watery. Spicy tingle at the end.    Lovely beer, definitely need to revisit (and I will) to clear up my thoughts.

Pours a medium coppery amber with a half finger off-white head with great retention and sheets of lacing. Aroma of lightly caramel malt, citrus and piney hops with a strong floral and estery fruit component, a hint of toffee. Flavor is pale malt with light caramel, citrus hops, lemon citrus, light stone fruit developing with a strong floral component. Finishes with citrus and piney hops, lightly resinous and lingering. Nice creamy body with good mouth feel. Another quite nicely brewed IPA with a great hop bill and once again the interesting floral elements that were also in the Azzaca IPA. Quite different than the West Coast styles I'm used to and very enjoyable. So far my introduction to Founders with its arrival in the West is very positive. Although I expected the best from the darker ales, the IPAs have been a pleasant surprise. Well done.

Strong caramel flavor up front; faint lemon citrus notes on the finish. A cloying, bitter American barleywine. Not good.

L: Hazy copper with finger width off white head with solid staying power.     S: Mouth watering aroma of floral, citrus and earthy hops.

Slight hazed deep amber hue, it tops with very thick and intense silky off-white head that lasts for long by great retention. It just slowly sinks to eternal foamy crown along with several sticky lacing patches on the glass-side.    Floral bouquet, earthy, citrus, some spice, pine, and resin from hop while some sweet creamy and biscuit from malt. Both of them are nicely mellow together. It becomes more fruity once get settled and opened.    Nice balance taste between malty sweetness and hop bitterness, hop is upfront with notes of citrus, earthy, resin, and pine while malt is slightly undertone with creaminess, sweetness and biscuit flavors. Bitterness is not that so hefty being counterbalanced by malt.    Medium body with smooth mouthfeel and medium carbonation generated some crisp and soft effervescence through the palate, finish is dry. Very straightforward AIPA, alcohol is very well concealed, another trademark for its style.

Sweet, toasty malts on the nose, mingling with pine and overripe citrus. Then the palette, wow - an oh-so-comfy hit of sinus-hugging lychee flora, honey, and fleshy spring grass.     The finish is exceptionally dry, and comes so quickly that you barely feel this stuff going down your throat. Then the pine returns to coat the palette, spurring on that next sip. Boo to the hop bombs and the tropical jerkoffs. Founders got the kinda kisses that I die for.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a tulip the beer has a lot of buoyancy and a 2" foaming, fizzy white head with a copper red amber body. soon the foam diminishes and becomes a thin head that stains the glass with every sip.  Aroma is pineapple, citrus, spring, and pine needles.  Taste is pine, mild citrus, earthy, and spicy. Mild carbonation, mildly bitterness, mildly tingling, dry finish that is well balanced til the last sip that becomes a big dose of hop flavor that numbs the tongue craving you to open another. Of course i would prefer a double IPA from Stone over this but for a single 7.2 abv IPA this is by far the best I've tasted.

Taste is very clean and crisp, hit with nice floral flavors and a burst of citrus with a backing of hops and light bitterness. The finish is a slight bitterness and dry, very pleasing beer overall. This is one of my favorite IPA, very light and clean and easy to sip on sunny fall afternoon.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Pours a deep, clear amber with a finger of light head  The aroma is sweet malt with some spice to be found  Hits the palate with sweet, toasty malt and some grassy hops that turn to pine later  Carbonation is gentle, overall mouthfeel is creamy and a little sticky  Overall an excellent example of the style. Very slightly too sweet for my preference though.

Always pours a thick, frothy head, and has a complex, fruity palette that keeps the taste of the hops without any sort of over-bitterness, but still with a bite. The body is surprisingly crisp and refreshing for a double IPA, and won't leave you feeling super full. Good for any time of the year! Founders always has well-rounded, tasty beers.

Taste is superb, absolute honey soaked bitter fruits. every sip is a forkful of bitterness dunked into a jar of honey. What a fantastic balance    If this isn't world class nothing is. Fantastic   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Clear, copper-tinged body; thick, sculpted, creamy head. Notes of pine and citrus hop aroma; bread crust and toasted grain notes, too. Semi-sweet malt taste with a low-key hop bitterness; pear and red apple fruit suggestions. Medium-heavy body; some glassiness and smoothness.    This beer was bottled 08/26/16. It delivers a well-rounded, balanced blend of gentle malt sweetness with a bold yet not overly aggressive hop presence. Pretty spiffy...

F = dryness yet not really astringent.    O = a great overall intersection of balanced IPA characteristics. On the downside it didn't seem to go with anything I tried to eat with it! Oh well.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Maybe I was expecting too much from this beer..maybe I bought a bad batch. In any case, I was not impressed. Color is a very dark amber with a decent sized, off-white head when poured into a pint glass. There is virtually nothing on the nose. Slight smell of citrus hops and very very faint scent of bread malt. I was expecting hops on the taste but really didn't get anything. For some reason I tasted a hint of peanut butter of all things. Granted, this is my 2nd beer of the night (1st was a Bear Republic Racer 5, which i thought was far better..) so that could have an impact. The Centennial IPA is very drinkable, however, and the 7.2% ABV is really masked well. Suffice it to say, I will probably not be rushing out to buy another 6-pack as there are far better examples of IPAs out there.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a bottle into a pint glass  Appearance: Dark orange/brown with a huge amount (4 fingers) of beige head that dissipates slowly.  Smell: Citrus hops plus some caramel  Taste: Perfectly balance bitterness from hops with malty sweetness. No unpleasant aftertaste at all. This is what a world-class IPA should taste like.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, full-bodied beer with moderate carbonation.  Overall: One of the best IPAs that I have tried thus far.

A: Mahogany, clear, large thick head, left lots of lacing around the side of the glass.     S: Heavy on the citrus hops, had a New Zeeland and Pacific Northwest like aroma.     T: A burst of strawberry and grapefruit against a strong malt backbone, finished with some rye, not boozy at all.     M: Medium to heavy body, not hugely carbonated, smooth.     O: Another very good IPA, not much more to say.

S: Balanced nose w/ citrus hops and pine and some sweetness w/ malt and caramel. Not as in-your-face as some IPAs.    T/F: Citrus hops flavor upfront, with some malt backbone to even things out, and a nice bit of of bitterness at the end. Medium body, not too heavily carbonated. Overall, a very balanced flavor.    O: Very tasty IPA! I would definitely get this one again. The alcohol can sneak up on you with this beer, so maybe not too many in one session.

Solid west coast style IPA.

look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Look: A very hazy, dark orange. A foamy, white head that dissipates quickly.    Smell: Strong aromas of earthy and floral hops, and a little bit of citrus and malt at the beginning. The really cool thing was that the scent changed as I drank this beer. About half way down the scent switched to be more caramel dominate. The citrus was still in the background the whole time.    Taste: Very similar to the smell. The first few sips were full of malt and citrus flavors. Really tasty. Then about half way down, as the caramel came out in the smell, it also came out in the taste. From half way until the end of this beer, the caramel flavor dominated the beginning of each sip. The finish was citrusy and dry the entire time. More of an orange citrus than anything else.    Feel: Surprisingly light. Light carbonation, which I always prefer. A slightly creamy mouthfeel overall, but still refreshing and crisp. Definitely a nice dry finish, but not too dry. It's a very balanced mouthfeel.    Overall: This beer has a lot going on, even for an IPA. The aroma, taste, and mouthfeel are all so balanced and done so well. Unfortunately, the 7.2% ABV doesn't make it very sessionable. I highly recommend this beer to pretty much anyone, and it's a must-drink if you love a good balanced IPA.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3.5 I don't see a date listed on the can.    Appearance: The body of the beer is a very hazy caramel orange and brown color. The head is very thick and fluffy. It is a yellow tobacco stained color. I can make out hazy shadows through the beer. Good retention and lacing.    Aroma: It has a nice pine aroma.    Taste: There is a sweet caramel taste with a bit of a bready touch to the beer. The hop flavors are muted pine and a touch of mint. The finish is a bit more of that sweet caramel.    Mouthfeel: Medium bitterness with a nice dry finish. The beer has a lot of caramel flavor which makes it feel like it is going to be thick or syrupy but it is not. It is very clean with a nice dry finish. The only downside is the bitterness feels a bit muddy but the overall drinking experience of this beer is very good.    Overall: It is a good East Coast style IPA with a good deal of sweet caramel flavor and a kick of pine and a moderate bitterness. It isn't bad but I don't feel that it is memorable. I probably wouldn't pick it up again but it would work as a good substitute for some of my other, more favored, East Coast style IPA's.

Smells and tastes very malty as well, but paired very nicely with centennial hops. This is pretty heavy as well, not something you'd want to drink much of, and at 7.2% abv, that's a good thing.

Ample carbonation clings to the sides of the glass. Rings on the glass side are epic.    S: fragrant; very sweet citrus, grapefruit rind, malt, sugar.    T: drier arrival than the nose lets on, not sweet at all. Some mild hoppiness on the arrival, a moderate citrus, which quickly transitions to a thick bready and ever so slightly sweet middle. The hops do present themselves with a little mild bittering on the end.    M: solidly midweight. Well carbonated, but not excessively so. Some residual slickness, but not much lingering hop character.    O: this is a really easy-drinking IPA. If what you are looking for is the definition of IPA, this is it. But it is comfort beer; it breaks no new ground. Would be s good fall season IPA. Reminds me of GL Burning River.

Smells mostly of pine and a little bit of bread. Tastes of bread with a little bit of bitterness and fading into orange citrus and a bit of pine towards the end. Body is light to medium with a good amount of carbonation. Flavor lingers for a little while afterwards. Overall a pleasant IPA, nothing outstanding but quite solid. Certainly one for the rotation though nothing I'd go out of my way to find.

Beer is a slightly hazy orange color. A somewhat vigorous pour generates a two finger off-white head that hangs around for a long time but provides little sheeting.    Aroma is primarily citrus zest (sweet orange or tangerine?) and also a little herbal, a touch soapy and a dash resiny. The whole affair is somewhat subdued, however. Granted, this bottle is almost 90 days old, but I was still expecting more.    Flavor is slightly sweet up front with a dash of crystal malt. Then, hops, seguing from the slightly sweet to bitter like citrus rinds. Not a very complex flavor, but if it's hops you crave, you've come to the right place. Might be a little old-fashioned compared to newer IPAs out there, but solid and drinkable.    Mouthfeel is ever-so-slightly creamy with a touch of dryness on the finish: the best part of drinking this beer to me.    Overall, I can see why this has been a standard go-to for over a decade. I don't love it, but I would gladly drink it if we meet again.

Aroma dropped those citrus, tangerine and grapefruit notes.    Taste is solid, wave after wave of the Centennial hop. Ages nicely compared to proprietary hops, this will stand strong still 100 days after bottling. Good format, good price. Pretty standard in its approach, does everything well above average. Not quite world class, but definitely one of the better regional ipas made.

There's some slight citrus flavor, but overall far too bitter for the lower overall gravity. I'm surprised this is only 65 IBUs. Color is too hazy.    Bottom line, better than your average IPA....but not the best Founders IPA. Flavor wise, All Day IPA is superior.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Tasted from 12 oz bottle.    Medium copper color and very clear with off-white , persistent head and lacing. Aroma is a great balance between bready malt and fresh, citrusy hops. Flavors are similar; fresh and balanced. Fluffy carbonation, mild alcohol burn. A truly great American IPA.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 From a growler, pours a deep, fairly dark, clear amber. A finger of off-white head leaves lots of sticky lacing. Smell is earthy and citrusy. More malt on the nose than in the flavor.     Taste: earthy, grapefruit pith, pine. Not a lot of malt sweetness. Decently dry, bitter finish.     Feel is a substantial medium, with just a hint of smooth slickness.     Overall a really nice IPA. Drinks like a bigger beer than the ABV should warrant.

Very nice bitterness, like a citrus peel all the way through.  F = Not as much carbonation as I thought it would have, but still nice and refreshing. The bitterness will help cut through anything you eat and it even more enjoyable.   O = I'm not an IPA person, but this one is very drinkable. The bitterness is nicely balanced.

A solid copper colored liquid with a clarity usually lacking in many dry-hopped beers.    S - The dry-hop gives an initial burst of aroma which soon gives way to a sweeter malty smell.    T - A very balanced flavor profile. Sweet with a solid citrus backbone. No aspect is overly dominant.    F - A somewhat light feel from the carbonation, but still far from watery.    O - An overall good beer that can be quite dangerous as nothing about it's flavor hints towards the 7.2% ABV lurking inside.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Usually I don't take the reviews to serious but I feel Founders beers deserve real review. Pours a nice amber caramel color with a light head. Smells of roasted caramel, maybe a little burnt maple syrup and a mild hop undertone. Upfront the taste is a rich roasted oak, dark roasted malt and a amber mild ale. Then the hops hit and take you back to what the beer is an IPA. I'm working my way into IPAs and I've got to say this is easily my favorite so far. It's not the basic plain IPA I've found most are. I would highly recommend this for someone wanting to relax around and enjoy a complexed beer. It looses some of it's flare as it gets hot tho.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Sweet, orange hued malty entry. Malts are robust without being syrupy. Bright, citric hops. Grapefruit rind and lemon are what I get. Big, hoppy bitterness without the big cohume bite you'd expect from such a hop forward beer. The hop bitterness smacks you across the palate than falls off fast. There are modest resinous notes that linger, coupled with the cereal grain notes in the finish. The hops are both lightly spiced and lightly floral. A great complement of orange hue malts combined with the citrus from the Centennials that make up this beer. A wonderful balance is struck in this offering. Light bodied. Dry finish. Carbonation and hops seem to embellish one another, but carbonation is appropriate. Super drinkable, gone before you realize it. A well, well crafted IPA. A must grab IF fresh. Check the bottled on date before purchasing. Cheers!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours an amber/gold with a hearty foamy white head. A great deal of lacing is left behind. Piney, resin, and dank hops form a hoppy, earthy aroma. Taste follows suit with earthy notes of resin, piney, and slightly dank hops. Mouth feel is smooth and filling. Good average thickness consistency. Overall, a solid IPA. A little more on the bitter, biting side of IPAs, but still good.     Served in a 12oz snifter.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 This is my introduction into Founders. It's not a bad beer, it is just kind of muddled as far as it's flavor. It goes down light and is pretty smooth for 7%+. But besides that it's kind of a let down. My beer was brewed on 11/27/15, but is a few months on a moderately high alcohol beer really going to make that much of a difference?   
look: 3.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 I was in a rut, I wanted a sixer of something good, but not to pricey. Racer 5 looked to be the go to, but, I hesitated and put it back. At a different place I saw Founders Centennial IPA, having never had this, I bit and bought it.     The pour was quick and a bit lackluster. The head was slightly foamy, and soap-sudsy-white that disappeared almost as soon as I blinked my eyes. The color is an inviting mid-copper tone. Smells are slight pine and malt.   The taste is almost exactly the same, thought the hoppiness does not linger as much as a hop head would like.  Being a Cali person, I'm far more partial to West Coast IPAs. So, this leaves a bit to be desired, but I wouldn't ever turn it down if offered. It's just not my cup of brew. NEEDS MORE HOPS! but, it's a good balance, because I actually like malty beers from time to time, and this offers a nice glassful.     Again, solid, but, not wooed.

Smells sharply of citrus, grapefruit, caramel, lemongrass.  Starts with light pine , then some grapefruit, then a good herbal bitterness in the middle, ending in a creamy residual bitterness, not at any point would I call the taste malty, this beer means business.  Mouthfeel I moderate to creamy, awesome for an ipa.  Overall, phenomenal, this beer is a prime example of not judging a book by it' cover, it blows me away.

The bitterness tingles the under sides of the tounge, making the taste a bit more captivating as you drink on. The mouth feel keeps you coming back.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Poured from a bottle that I can't find a date on, straight copper beer, copper white head with a little lacing. Little to no smell, but if it's there it's a light malt. Taste is straight malt too. That being said, it's a good clean malt. And a light bodied, crisp finishing beer. I don't know if it expired or maybe I'm just missing what all the hype's about. Gonna have to chalk it up as a do-over. Just an average malt bomb without even a large ABV to reward the drinker. That being said, it's still pretty decent.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Moving up the latter in the Founders world, this 12 ounce bottle makes its way into my residence. On to the beer:    A clean copper body shines below a half-inch of somewhat creamy head which dissipates into a patchy lace. I smell something hoppy, and those Centennial hops are making me smile. I get healthy hits of lemon, citrus, grapefruit and a smack of honey. It somehow gets better, especially now in the era of grapefruit IPA's and Mosaic hopped ales. This ale holds a great hoppiness without going too far. The tastes of lemon, tangerine, grapefruit, leading to a somewhat sweet and citric finish finds a way to keep luring me in. It doesn't features a bitter aftertaste, and is really smooth going down.     Centennial IPA delivers an outstanding, honest IPA flavor. Now that I can buy it in California, I will be drinking some more in the future!

Smells of floral hops, slightly onion, large citrus, along with some pine. Taste reflects the smell. Initial floral bitterness goes into a slight pine flavor, finishing with a crisp citrus bitterness. Feel is above medium, letting this feel like a juice. Ample carbonation, not flat at all. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that's tasty.

So very complex in taste, obvious as an IPA but malt balance is excellent, a nice hop hit but not overly resin like or citrus, more of an orange thing going on. There is a bread/biscuit thing going on, and some spice. The outstanding thing is just the balance of it all and the complexities that open up as it warms. Mouthfeel is perfect, not thin but not palate ruining. This beer really hides its higher ABV. I have had poorer examples of this, freshness is the key to retaining the hop and malt balance. IMO one of the best beers in the US if gotten fresh.

A: Resin, pine, citrus, sweet malty aroma, not getting any alcohol on the nose, more pine forward than citrus forward, pretty straightforward aroma.     T: First impression is that this is not overly hoppy or malty, very balanced. Citrus, floral, some pine and resin, hit of hop bitterness, finish is dry with a hint of grapefruit peel in the aftertaste.    M: Medium mouthfeel with a dry finish.    O: A very drinkable IPA, balanced, the ABV is well-hidden in the beer. A solid IPA that I would reach for again. I would like it a little fresher but at 5 weeks its holding up pretty well.

(also not to unique.... good but not unique). there is a pine like taste and a citrus finish . Not what i was hoping for but overall not a bad beer.

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3 Paid $1.39 for this beast at a local supermarket.     It pours a honey colored body with a large fluffy 3 finger head. The lace left behind is thin but plenteous. Opacity is about 70%.     Sweet aromas of brown sugar, powdered sugar, honey, and onion. A bit of garlic and malt as well. Could do without the onion/garlic.     Taste is just ok. Lots of dull pine, day old citrus rinds, sticky resin, and a touch of powdered sugar. Behind that is a full on assault of onion, and garlic powder.     Feel is adequate but not great. Semi-creamy, medium bodied, fair carbonation. Semi-dry finish.     Overall this was a disappointment. Didn't care for it, wouldn't have it again. Founders has done better and there's certainly better IPA's out there. This came across overall as uninspired and dull...and I've got a headache now.

Look: Has a deep copper hued body, with a half finger white head.    Smell: Has a good balance of pine and earthly aromas, and some citrus fruits with dank hops emerging underneath.    Feel: Medium bodied, and heavily carbonated; almost feels like a soda.    Taste: Up front is some bitter hops, and dank piney resin. Some citrus fruit, caramel, and some biscuity malts appear on the back end, and all create a nice equilibrium into the aftertaste.    Overall: Great balance of ingredients going on here, nothing is too overpowering, but there enough to be pleasant. This was, however, a bit old for an IPA (about two months), so I may have not experienced the full spectrum of this beer. Will try a fresher one sometime and update.

I note honey, malt, biscuits, citrus (as in grapefruit pith) and bitter hops with a medium body. Highly moreish! At 7.2 ABV, this is not a session ale, and the warmth of the alcohol does peak through. Attractive Belgian lace forms readily!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12 oz. bottle into an IPA glass    A - This beer pours a beautiful clear amber in color with a 2 finger off white head that has a bit of an orange tint to it. The head is frothy with a bit of creaminess and dissipates slowly. Beer is seems to be lightly carbonation with bubbles rising slowly to the top. 4.25/5    S - The aroma is much more malty than most pale ales that I have had. There is a bit of floral as well as citrus hops but there is also a rich sweet maltiness that acts as a backbone to the aroma. The floral hops comes across a bit more than the citrus with the citrus playing a bit of second fiddle to the floral. The maltiness showcases a bit of caramel. 4.25/5    T - Rich dark stone fruit (plums and dates) as well as a rich maltiness are right up front on the taste which transitions to a bit of citrus hops. The citrus here is not the typical grapefruit, but more along the lines of oranges and tangerines. The malt comes across somewhat as an Oktoberfest-esque sweetness/maltiness. A bit of caramel sweetness is present throughout. Along with the malt, there is a bit of a clover honey note throughout. An ever so slight spiciness is present as well. Bitterness on the finish is light but lingers somewhat. 4.25/5    M - Decent carbonation burn up front which transitions to a bit of a smoothness in the middle and a slight drying on the back end. Medium bodied. 4.25/5    O - Very nice balanced beer between sweet maltiness and bitter hops along with a nice complexity of flavors with obvious flavor transitions. The 7.2% abv really doesn't make a noticeable appearance in the flavor. The aroma complements the flavor nicely and provides a nice preview of the flavor. 4.25/5

I don't know how this one isn't classified as a DIPA, personally, it has many of the characteristics: strong and sweet malty backbone; plentiful honeyed floral and herbal hop notes; and a well-hidden ABV that sneaks up on you. I cannot stress what a sleeper this one is. It looks like just another IPA sitting on the shelf, with its muted label and almost generic name. The contents, however, are anything but generic.

Beer poured with a brown-amber appearance, a thin head, and with some thin lacing on the sides. Really full aromas including a very malt mixed smell alongside a sweetness, like caramel, and a dark fruit flavor, like grapes or plums. Very sweet beer that follows the nose. Felt like a good mix of grapefruit alongside sugary malts. Good creamy texture for this drink allowing the drink to feel warm, boozy, and tasty. Overall, really excellent aromas and mouthfeel.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Bottled 09/03/15, drunk on 11/11/15. Poured into pint glass.  Orange in color, with a floral citrus scent. Very balanced flavor profile, bright hoppiness yet sweet, with malty undertones. The head is nice and the feel pleasant on the tongue. Finishes clean & not too bitter. Overall the Centennial is a great example of an American IPA.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a golden orange-yellow. Smells of floral and tropical hops. Taste is floral and fruity, with a slightly sweet malt taste. This IPA is not very bitter, and the hops aren't too aggressive. It goes down smooth with decent carbonation and a fair, medium body. Overall a good IPA if you want some fruity, floral hops without the huge bitterness commonly associated with IPA's.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a pint glass from a 12 ounce bottle about one month old. An aggressive pour brings a huge white/light tan head that sticks around eventually leaving extensive lacing. Nice brown/orangish color. Aroma is hops, citrus, floral, and malt. Taste follows the smell. Very nice balance, not bitter, with a strong malt presence. More floral than citrus. The mouthfeel is oily and fairly thick. Overall this is a great, balanced IPA. More floral and malty than I usually look for, but a delicious beer I could drink all day. Another great offering from Founders.
