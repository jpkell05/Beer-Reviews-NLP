look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 The look is a cloudy, straw yellow with plenty of bubbles, a large pillow of white foam that lasts, then settles to an eighth inch and never gets any smaller.(to the last swallow!)  This is a beer you can smell when the bottle opens, wheat, yeast, banana,& slight clove  The taste is what you smell, plus the little bubble gum on the tongue before you swallow, not bitter at all. So good!  The feel is creamy with some carbonation. Smooth!  The flavor is different than most beer styles, but I could see this flavor could become a craving. This brand is exact to the description of a German Hefe Weiss!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a 500ml bottle into a Teku/IPA shaped pint glass after swirling yeast to mix in after half the bottle was poured out.    Look: Wonderful hazy gold/toasted yellow pour. 1/2 cm rocky foam that slowly dissipates into a 1 mm lacy foam head.  Smell: Strong, light fruit smell off the bat. Nice hint of fresh baked bread from the malt. Tiniest hints of cloves and vanilla.  Taste: Sweetness coats the tongue. Starts out nice and malty, with a hint of roasted nuts. Very quick flash of cloves act as a transition. Majority of the flavor is a very soft fruit flavor that makes its presence known quickly, and slowly fades into the background where the cloves make another brief but noticeable appearance.   Feel: Very smooth, slightly thick but not chewy. Flows very smoothly over the tongue, carbonation is very well balanced.    Overall: A fantastic beer, that everyone should try. I would highly recommend keeping this stocked, or using as a special treat for oneself. The best way I can describe this beer is that it tastes like biting into a piece of freshly baked banana bread that has just a tiny bit of walnuts in it. One of my favorite beers, without a doubt.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 This craft earth-shattering anthemic beer with vibrant depth and a forceful punch. The powerhouse beer’s defiant yet atmospheric taste is perfectly captured on its debut beer from 1040. This beer was premiered by The Huffington Post who reported, “Together, the beer and bubbles provide an aura that is subtle, unpredictable and claims no specific color. But still, it’s there, like a curious field of suppressed energy. It’s almost shamanistic.” As Bayerische Stastsbrauerei declares….“Our beer is about altering your consciousness through the sheer power of Beer…Our beers don’t deal with your politics, they question the nature of your reality.” In the fall of 2016 Leaders of Bayerische Stastsbrauerei were asked by beer label Reimagine to do a full brew of original versions of songs by The Police, a band they have often been compared to - if Sting was a high energy and inventive beer. Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier went #1 on Peru’s most revered mainstream Beer teview website, Beer Doble Nueve in Lima.

Nose is dominated by clove, not so much banana. Spicy notes in general. Taste follows suit with a nice fuller than average body and a bit yeasty aftertaste. Yeasty in the sense of slight sharp bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Soft carbonation for the style, or rather, probably the thickness plays down the carbonation. In sum, the benchmark for hefeweizen. Pure, balanced, very very drinkable. Many hefes are either too sweet or sharp to really want to drink too many in a row. This one is one that beckons beyons the first acquaintance.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 I should start by saying that I am not a great fan of wheat beers. I find them a touch chalky and with an off putting fruity smell/taste. Obviously, that is characteristic of wheat beers, but not to my taste. L. From 500 ml bottle into tall glass. Impressive white head above a golden, slightly murky body. Dissipates reasonably quickly to lacing. S. That fruity, sweet slightly pungent smell that I find slightly unpleasant. Other touches of perhaps a little spice. T. Similar, the high carbonation adds a slightly astringent feel that dries out the sweetness on the finish. F. Almost bubbly, but quite smooth and drinkable with it. O. I don't doubt that this is a great example, but I enjoy the dunkel more as it pushes the fruity sweetness down under a darker grain taste.

Very easy drinking - great summer beer on our last week of summer (though high of 6 C today....).

The bartender recommended "The Dude" imperial stout beer that she liked that I did not (a strange Imperial, too sweet, like a Red). Then I asked about this beer and she said this beer was not well-liked by customers. I tried it and really liked it. Then I looked it up, admittedly for validation of my own tastes. If you like Hoegaarden, you should like this beer. The oldest brewery in the world has nothing to prove. To each his own, and I'm not sure what they're drinking and liking at that restaurant, but this is an excellent beer.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 11 Oz Bottle poured into glass  Look - Partially clear but a little hazy deep yellow almost like gatorade. Very thick foam head leaves lacing on glass  Smell - Strong mix of cloves and banana puree. A wisp of nutmeg, cinnamon, garlic, and some wheat.   Taste - Similar to the aroma, some vanilla notes added but the yeast really makes an appearance. Smooth and fresh taste. Carbonation is medium. The spices aren't too dominating which is nice. Everything is balanced, not too sweet either. On the light side but it is a wheat beer so that is to be expected, very easy drinking.     If you are new to these styles of beer, remember to swish the bottle around when you get towards the end of the pour so that the yeast is able to come out. Kicks up the flavor a notch. This is an excellent beer as the rating suggests. Mostly a summer beer because of the light-ish body. Would like to try it on tap but for the bottle version, I will give it an A-

This is about as attractive as a beer can get.    Banana, cloves, yeast. It smells exactly what you’d expect from a Hefeweizen.    Taste follows nose exactly as anticipated. Strong banana on the front end with excellent balancing of clove and spice to keep it just in check.    Sweet and refreshing. Light bodied, medium carbonation. Very sessionable.    This beer is incredible. It’s available on tap all over in my area, if you can get it try it! But even out of the bottle it’s right there. For the style, this for me is at the very top.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 Weihenstephaner Hefe-Weissbier - 5.4% ABV - 14 IBUs   Date: Code 1128   Appearance: Cloudy yellow in color with an expected three fingers of fluffy white head, and a good amount of carbonation rising up.   Aroma: The nose is largely a huge ripe banana aroma but the typical yeast and some subtle spices are also present.   Taste: The taste follows the nose quite closely with a lot of banana, yeast, perhaps a little orange, and tinges of spice before coming back around to banana for the finish. This one feels light for a wheat based beer, with a very creamy mouthfeel that is reminiscent of a NE IPA. As expected, there is some sweetness here but there is just enough hop character to keep it in check. This is a very well rounded and accurate example of what a traditional hefe-weisse beer should be.   Biased comments: This one has held up well for its age, although I must say that after so many thick, chewy, and high ABV craft beers, this one does almost feel watery. However, the fantastic mix of bananas and yeast help to give it a good boost in my opinion. But, the wateriness, the carb, and caloric content for what you are getting, a relatively low ABV beer, is really the only thing that prevents this one from being on permeant rotation in my fridge.

Pours a cloudy deep golden straw in the glass with almost four fingers of dense creamy head. One of the best heads on a beer I've ever had. Nose starts off with spicy clove that transitions into a bread pudding consisting of fresh bananas, wheat bread and vanilla. I also get some white grapes, cinnamon and cardamom at the end. Taste follows the nose closely; it's crazy how close this is to a well made banana bread pudding. Big clove, cooked banana, wheat bread, cinnamon and vanilla stand out on first taste. The rest of notes of the nose follow closely afterwards with an addition of yeastiness that I didn't catch initially. Creamy medium body with consistent small bubbled carbonation. Medium-high sweetness, so if you're not looking a big desert-like punch of flavor, this isn't for you. I can't get over how well this is brewed and how distinct the taste is, even from other Hefeweizen. You can pretty much pick this up from anywhere these days and it's not one you want to miss.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 500 ml. bottle poured into a 20 oz. mug. A gentle pour creates a finger thick eggshell white long lasting head.   Large and small bubbles shrink to a creamy foam. No lacing yet it has "legs".  Vintage maple or orange-pineapple juice colour, hazy and opaque.   Smells of yeasty sourdough bread, banana, fruit cocktail with a faint must.  Sweet malt, banana, slightly sour apple juice and peppery hops control the taste- in that order.  Medium to rich oily body with lots of CO2. Great balance between sweet, a little sour and bitter hops.   Centuries " spelled correctly this time" of practice have paid off. I tried this beer's Dunkel cousin, I don't have a favorite as both are outstanding and suprisingly different. This verion has more pronounced fruit flavors, might be a better choice for the upcomming heat wave.

I’d still take a world class ale over a world class hefe, but for the style this is certainly among the greats.

The flavors are a bit light, but what they lack in intensity, they make up for in balance. I can definitely understand why this is a standard-bearer for the style, and while not particularly outstanding, is certainly not a beer to turn down in the future.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Very good demure banana flavor beer with clove/bread background noise. Just not my style, to be honest. I would prefer it be a bit more balanced with malts like Schneider Aventus, but that's just me.    Have to edit:    Being a bit more refined in my beer judging now, I have to say this has some of the best looks in the glass of any beer. Great glassy, golden color and lacing. Nice head. Very light, refreshing banana flavor. Upping from 4 to 4.25   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 From notes taken 06/14/17:    Very clear golden amber yellow with sparse and fine haze. Second pour though a marbled, mottled, variegated, swirly, murky work of art. Different shades and densities and finenesses and depths, heavier and darker toward the bulb of this Weizen glass, with speckles hear and there of larger chunks clinging to the inner walls of the glass. Pillowy, long-lasting bright off-white head of creamy fluff. Clearly a filtered Hefe. Banana and yeast aromas, both strong, and enough in balance to where determining where one begins and the other ends is pointless. Even more banana-forward, not quit bubblegum to taste. Sloshing around yields a rich, bready, and almost savory yeast character. Finish has a light metallic tartness but not enough to disrupt the balance. Light-bodied with very active and slightly tingly but very soft and squishy suds. Semi-astringent.

There is also some spiciness with it and wheat aromas. There is a slight bit of bubblegum as well.     Taste: It has a strong banana flavor with wheat a bit of spiciness to it. It has a sweet impression. As it warms, there is a it of clove that can be tasted. There is a slight hint of vanilla.     Feel: It has a moderately light body. It is somewhat creamy.     Overall, a very refreshing wheat beer with excellent banana and clove flavors.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Even pouring slower than I have ever poured a beer, over two fingers worth of white very dense crown formed. And it stays around. Was not expecting that. The beer itself is a straw/golden color. On the clear side, but not perfectly clear.   Now the smell, is beautiful. Bananas are huge. Smells like banana pudding.   The taste is much of the same. It's a lot like banana pudding. The bananas are huge and it has such a nice sweetness to it. Almost like vanilla wafers.   The feeling coats your mouth with the flavor and stays. Sticky.   Overall, it is a great beer. The only thing I can say bad about it is I would like to be able to not be so careful pouring and have to so slow. But that's minor compared to the flavor and smells this beer gives.

Nice head, nice lacing from the bottle to the hefe glass. Tasting it by itself, without the spicy food, the classic banana/clove appears but , for me, this is fairly subdued. This may be the summer I get into hefeweissen. I going to have to revisit Franziskaner!

This is an outstanding piece of craftsmanship and a damn good hefewiesen/hefeweissbeir. It pours cloudy with a nice/decent head. Its colour is a hazy sun color. The smell is of wheat, orange, and lemon. The taste is grains,sweet but not overpowered citrus, and almost a hint of nut and overtones of banana. Overall this one I will be returning to very soon.

Aroma: Strong eaters of banana and clove yeast, with a hint of lemon and wheat maltiness Taste: Rich, sweet wheat maltiness, strong fruit esters of pear and banana, finished with some clove spice and a light bitterness Mouthfeel: Moderate bodied with a nice creaminess from the wheat, and a high carbonation. Finish: Banana and pear eaters dominate the finish and linger long after the swallow Overall: World class hefe with an amazing yeast character that transforms the beer. Fruity esters of banana and pear dominate the aroma all the way through the taste and finish. Pinch of clove spice creates balance, and high wheat protein character adds a luscious creaminess to the body and creates an amazing frothy foam head. High carbonation accentuates everything.

This is your starting off point of the top shelf German hefeweizens. A great balance of flavor right here. It does not deserve much higher than that grade nor does it deserve much lower than that grade. A great balance in score just like the flavor that it brings. I think this beer used to be a little better back in the days when it wasn't so mass produced. Cheers! A-

Golden yellow with a slight haze, extremely dense head that dissipates to about 1/4 inch that resembles whipped cream. (amazing) Very complex flavors, wheat and grain upfront, followed by a slight sweetness and then a hint of cloves.(similar to Hoegarden but not nearly as assertive) The 1/4 inch whipped cream head lasted the entire glass. I don't know if this is bottle conditioned but it also had a small layer of sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Really special, glad I found it.

An exceptionally well-balanced beer where yeastiness, spiceyness and fruitiness are in perfect balance.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Bottle dated 3187 (May 3, 2017). Hefeweizen glass.    A: pours a turbid yellow-orange (made sure to swirl the yeast) with 1-1.5 fingers of fluffy, bubbly, white head and loads of carbonation blasting away.    S: more banana and clove than the American hefeweizens I've had. This borders on Belgian wit territory, but without the bubblegummy phenolic edge.    T: bready and slightly sour-tangy arrival. Moderate sourdough breadiness on mid palate, closing out to a light bitterness and underripe banana note. Slight wheaty sourdough taste lingers.    M: light and creamy, loads of effervescence.    O: I know this is a 6 month old bottle, but that's par for the course around here. I'd love to try this on draft next time to see how much better it is. As it stands, I agree with the chorus of people who say this is the best hefeweizen around. But as a style I am underwhelmed as compared to witbiers and American wheat ales. This is an understated and quaffable style, and except for rapid distribution, Weihenstephaner has executed it pretty well, as far as I am concerned. Think it would be better fresh. Liked their dunkelweizen more, and Hacker-Pschorr better.

I'd enjoy this in the spring or summer, possibly at room temp to bring out those darker, sweeter profiles!

S: Yellow banana, orange peel, green apple, pear, white bread, honey, vanilla, straw, and clove.    T: Sweet banana like Runts banana candy, complimented by orange zest and more subtle orchard fruits such as red and green apple and pear. The malt backbone correlated with the mouthfeel, being more of a pillowy, doughy sensation than an actual taste, with a dab of that aforementioned honey and vanilla. Upon further drinking, I even notice notes of honeydew melon and green grape. On the back end, the ripe banana/apple/pear/orange sweetness transitions into a light dryness with notes of straw, coriander and clove, giving way to a refreshing clean finish.    F: A little thin than expected given the appearance, but still great. Soft and smooth and gently creamy, a bit thin in the middle, but with a nice moderate carbonation that makes it thirst-quenching and refreshing.    O: Does a traditional hefeweizen get any better than this? Leave it to the Germans to invite AND perfect this tasty style. Truly a world-class beer.

look: 5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 2 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 2.5 I've been wanting to try this style of beer and figured I might as well try a world class style defining brew so when I saw this at the store I picked it up with high hopes. For starters this is truly a gorgeous looking beer and has one of the best heads I've seen. When it came to trying the beer though I quickly reached the conclusion that this style just isn't for me. I'm generally not a fan of wheat beers and this one just didn't agree with my palate. Strong wheat flavor with slight banana, clove, floral and maybe bubblegum notes. Again this seems like a well made beer and I'm sure it's great if you enjoy similar styles but this one just isn't for me, I didn't enjoy it.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 Here is another BA top 250 that is over hyped and does not belong on the list. I love hefeweisens and this one is very mediocre.     Look is hazy, cloudy, tea like with bubbly lacing.     Aroma is wheat, malt, and mild banana    Mouthfeel is thin, watery, creamy, and flat  Taste is very subtle of bananas and wheat, can't grasp any clove.  Overall there are better hefeweisens out there and was hoping for much stronger banana and clove flavor. When it all comes down to it I'd rather have a Hoegarden and was very much hoping this would be better. Sure in the year 1040 this may have been some amazing beverage but now in 2017 it's pretty plain. Perhaps there wouldn't be other hefeweisens without this but just doesn't cut it for what I want my hefeweisen to be.

I love it for its balanced and moderate but distinct flavors and for being such a classic Hefewezien and yet such a great beer.    Look: golden hazy hue with very thick (three-inch) white foamy head.    Aroma: The aroma is wheat, yeast, banana and maybe a tad citrus.    Taste: the usual Hefeweizen flavors wheat, yeast, banana, a little bit cloves and maybe a hint of orange but the flavors are just really well composed and well balanced.    Feel: The body is light to medium and it's crisp and thirst quenching.

Nose is fair in strength with nice aromas of bananas, wheat and yeast over a bready malt base.   The taste is similar but more robust with honey suckle and hints of orange.  It drinks smooth with a crisp clean finish and just a bit of bite from the moderate to high carbonation. The body is just full enough to call it medium and adds to the refreshing easy drinking experience that this provides.  I agree with the "world class" rating.  Excellent!   Recommended to all.

Saw this beer in the lineup at my favourite watering hole in Hamilton (The Brain on James St. N) and grabbed a pint tastefully served in a branded weizen glass.  Look: Cloudy pale orange with a creamy foam head from the draft pour.  Smell: Citrus smells like orange zest and bready malt nose.  Taste: More of the orange zest with biscuit malt coming through.  Overall: A very solid wheat beer that will be oh so enjoyable in the hot summer months to come.

Typical cloudy body is seen. The smell is the banana up front with some yeastiness and graininess. The taste is sweet with previously mentioned flavors combined decently. The palate is light to medium with a decent creaminess all around. Overall, this is a great hefeweizen and good for me.

Colour is brilliant cloudy yellow with light carbonation and really thick cream that keeps its volume. Strong bouquet of malt, citrus and taste is a sweet mix of spice, citrus and a little hops. Just an all around great tasting beer that goes down right and proper.

Smooth with low carbonation and its yeast being somewhat on the milder sweet side. Funny though that the taste of its head reminded me of sweet canned corn...  Altogether a very pleasant, easy to drink hefeweizen. Had two in a row on tap at a steak parlor in Vienna, AT.

Banana, Belgian yeast and spices on the nose - definitely a bit of clove. Banana up-front on the palette, followed by clove, pepper and nutmeg. The flavours all harmonise very well in this beer. Creamy with a slight fizz on the tongue and a lingering dry finish. Exemplary wheat beer.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured into a tall pint glass.    Very hazy bright golden color, high carbonation. Good retention and lacing from its big soapy, fluffy white head.    Smells incredibly citrusy, with the smell of orange, bubble gum, banana, and cloves masking my nose. Of course wheaty, yeasty, and grainy, along with biscuit and bread malts.    Taste is much like the aroma. There's also a lot of different other spices as well, like coriander and other floral hops.    Outstanding.

Taste follows the nose, with really nice balanced notes of orange, wheat, bread, and a bit of hops. Really nice, with a nice mouthfeel.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 L -- Pours a fairly hazed bight orange with a dense, white, three-finger head produced with gentle pour. Fabulous, pillowy retention and excellent lacing.   S -- Fruity yeast esters (mostly banana), clove, pepper, nutmeg, pilsner malts, wheat, and a little lemon  T -- Taste largely follows the nose. Quite similar to Allagash White, but with a much more pleasant spiciness and overall better flavor balance. Also getting cinnamon, cardamon, and anise  F -- Refreshing, quaffable, and flavorful. Well carbonated, but not overly fizzy. Amazingly soft mouthfeel, thanks to the wheat  O -- My favorite wheat beer to date, much more flavorful and well-balanced than most. Pretty good value at $12/6-pack    90/100

S: Spicy and has that distinctive German yeast strain smell (at least I think it's the yeast).    T: Of course has the banana and clove notes, but not as much as I expected. Some lemon as well. Some grain qualities, but not really sweet like malt can sometimes be. Very clean, somewhat dry finish.    F: Fairly light body and carbonation. Very smooth and almost too easy to drink.    O: I think the best word to describe this beer is balance. All the flavors work well together and nothing dominates. So easy to drink I wish I had bought a six pack of this instead of a single. I may have to go back to get more.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Beautiful thick cloud of foam with nice lacing. Color is orange and cloudy.

Palate is full of frothy tropical overripe banana, lemon, yogurt, yeast, honey, sourdough, funk, wet alfalfa. Body is thick, light, and creamy. Carbonation is big yet lacing. Pros beautiful, intense flavor, smooth, crisp, evidence of the 500year rule. Cons rich banana bread flavor can be overwhelming especially if one doesn't like bananas; some complexity but lost slightly in the banana. 96/100.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 This Hefe is quite nice for the style with noticable clove & banana flavours but I'm no expert on the style & frankly the style is not one of my favourites. I'm doing this short review largely for my own records so if you're looking for Hefe advice, you'll need to look elsewhere. That said, as a lover of IPAs & stouts, I would gladly enjoy one of these on a hot day if it were offered, but I won't likely go out of my way to get one.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Being completely honest, I'm being generous with my numbers above owing to the beer's reputation and my own style preferences and biases. I used to love wheat beers before my IPA and imperial stout days; now, everything else seems to fall short. Additionally, I drank this particular beer immediately after Stone Enjoy By DIPA, which provided a more immediate contrast.  It was beautiful to look at - cloudy and golden with a huge head with good retention and lots of bubbles rising. Aroma is of funky overripe banana, wheat, yeast, lemon, spice. Taste is similar and very wheaty. A tiny bit of sweetness, sourness, and bitterness all balanced together all the way through the finish. There was also a note of artificial lemon juice that I did not enjoy.   I appreciate that it is well crafted but it is not my cup of tea these days so maybe I shouldn't be reviewing it in the first place. I do recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys wheaty beers.

Effervescence spews wildly from the bottom with each sip or disturbance of the glass. There is a nice pillowy surface cap left behind. Aroma is wheat malt, banana, orange, yeast & coriander with lemon hints. Taste is bready wheat malt, banana & some clove to give a hint of bubblegum, dry, lightly biting bitter finish. Aftertaste is gelatinous, dry wheat & yeast. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with moderate-high carbonation, tongue clinging, soapy, chewy & very dry. Very pleasant & refreshing.

There are many sticky spots of lacing left on the glass. Absolutely gorgeous.    The smell is excellent. Banana and clove are most apparent with peppery spice, bubblegum and wheat.    Taste is the same. The banana flavor comes on strong at the beginning, but is swept aside by clove and pepper on the finish.    Feel is medium bodied and very smooth. I wish there was a bit more carbonation.    Overall a great hefeweizen. Very flavorful, smooth and easy drinking. Definitely worth the price of admission and a must try for any fan of the style.

It was a marriage made in heaven. I discovered Weihenstephaner back in the States and also found their Helles Lager. What a pour! Yellow and cloudy with an absolute thick creamy head. The taste is a mixture of banana and cloves and hangs in there for every swallow. It is actually GREAT! Added to their Helles Lager these beers are my staples. I don't get out often anymore, but these are staples at home. No doubt that this brewery really knows its stuff!

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Super opaque milky yellow with a thick, creamy white head that clings on the way down in ridges, but does not leave lace.    Smell is cracked wheat and white bread with banana, pear and very light spice.    A semi-sweet tang brings wheat with pear and lemon accents. Very light on phenolic spiciness, this is very drinkable with a semi-dry, smooth soft feel via a medium-light body. I get a touch of licorice in the very distant aftertaste.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Pours with a large but very quickly dissipating head. Not much lacing. Straw-colored and cloudy.    Aromas of esters very forward and prominent--banana and citrus as expected, and very pleasing. Bubblegum sweetness in the background. Very little if any phenolic spice. Very little yeast. Rather subdued overall, but still a fine aroma.    Tastes much like the aroma in the same order of prominence, with the esters perhaps overpowering the other aspects. Banana and gingerbread flavors immediately come to mind, with a touch of pepper in the aftertaste. Not sickly sweet, but perhaps a bit sweeter than expected.    The mouthfeel is remarkably full-bodied, and even slick, but with a nice crisp finish, doubtless from strong carbonation.    Overall a fine brew that I will likely try again for a re-rate, just in case I got an "old" bottle. I like wheat beers, including others by this brewer, but was somewhat disappointed in what others have found to be the "paragon" of the style. This one checks all of the boxes for a Hefe, but seemed out of balance, with too much emphasis on the sweetness, and not enough yeast and spice.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 I got this beer at my local super market the label caught my eye. "Weihenstephaner Worlds Oldest Brewery" had a nice ring to it. I poured the beer into a 24oz glass. Pours with a big head that takes some time to dissipate. In my glass, the beer has a dark yellow top. The bottom of the glass seems to be a lighter yellow. It is a nice, "eye catchy" flow. The beer smells very fruity. I can smell very sweet fruit like Bananas and apples, as well as floral hops. It's an overall very pleasant smell. The taste is very different. I have never tasted a beer that tastes quite like this. It tastes very fruity and a little dry. I can defiantly taste the dryness of bread and corn. The beer is also very sweet with a slight barley noticeably banana taste. It also has a nice slight hint of lemon. The taste really blends together as you swallow it. Reminds me of a beer that would be marketed as a "sumer Ale." It kind of reminded me of a better version of AtWaters, "Dirty Blonde." Overall, it is something that is very different. I would buy it again, I liked it.

Haven't had much of this style, but I get strong strong notes of yeast, banana, and clove. Powerful smelling beer that is almost overwhelmed by the scent of yeast.  T-Much sweeter than expected at first, then once I continued to sip it became less and less sweet and more mellow and yeasty. I get notes of banana in this beer, also clove. Very pleasant and wonderfully put together.  MF- mellow and slight carbonation that makes for a very well balanced and drinkable beer.  O- Well crafted and neatly balanced beer. A pure joy to drink for a very likable price range. Will seek out again.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Decanted from an 11.2 oz (330 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; coded 3248, which, if I understand the coding, is 3rd day of 24th week of 2018 or June 13, 2018.  A: Pours a hazy, golden-orange with a fluffy, white, one inch head, strong retention, and decent rings of lacing.  S: Tangy. Aromas of banana, cloves, and apple.  T: Sharp and sweet. Flavors largely follow the nose with banana and cloves, but more lemon than apple. Spicy.  M: Medium bodied with solid effervescence. Drinks bubbly, but still smooth, creamy, and clean.  O: One of the beers that sets the standard for the style.

Nose of wheat, banana, and mild clove    Taste follows, with a fantastic balance of the standard wheat beer flavors. Wheaty, but also containing smooth fruit presences.    Mouth is very refreshing.    A brewery does not operate a millennium without doing something right, and Weihenstephaner has produced platonic ideal of a wheat beer in this one.

Appearance: Hazy straw yellow with a 1-finger creamy head that lingers for a few minutes.    Smell: Strong smell of biscuit, banana and clove spiciness.    Taste: Wheat bread (obviously), some banana and spiciness, with a persistent biscuit-like taste. No bitterness present at all.    Feel: Lighter carbonation than many other wheat beers I've had, which is nice. Smooth in the mouth, with just the right amount of fizz.    Overall: A treat to drink. It's easy to see why this is one of the best wheat beers in the world. Refreshing and tasty, and it goes down easy.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 It's like tasting the original pizza. The Ur-Pizza. This is what wheat beer is based on, this one here. Poured into a a DFH wheat beer glass, 2 fingers of foam, opaque rusted gold color, good lacing. Slight carbo. Almost to drinkable. What else can I say?   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 1 pint 0.9 ounce bottle into a Shaker pint glass, there is no "best by" date that I can find.    APPEARANCE: pours a hazy, straw color with one-finger white head that dissipated until a thin, broken layer of small bubbles remained, there is heavy lacing on the glass, lighter carbonation.    SMELL: bread, banana and cloves.    TASTE: the taste follows the nose precisely, bread, banana and clove, the taste intensified/improved as the beer warmed, this style relies more on the yeast and less on the hops for it's flavor.    PALATE: medium body and somewhat creamy.    OVERALL: I enjoy this style and this is probably going to be hard to beat, these guys have been making this beer a long time and frankly have perfected it, I will buy this again and would recommend to everyone who enjoys the style.

Smells like what you would expect.. yeasty, subtle banana, spice, a bit tangy.    Tastes fantastic. Sharp initially then smooths out letting the yeast, and banana/clove flavors come into play leaving a lingering taste I describe as wheat beer for lack of a better term.     Feel is very good, a bit sharp and drying on the finish, Smooth and very drinkable.    Great beer!

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Really dug the appearance on this one, benchmark for style kind of stuff. Bright yellow, chunky cloudiness, pristine 3/4" white head. Aroma gives you those health food store wheatgrass citrusy lemon precursors on top of grain.    All of that comes out in the taste. Pretty full bodied mouthfeel kind of stuff. The format 500ml is a little expensive compared to 12oz offerings, but this is some pretty good benchmark for the hefeweizen style. The yeast isnt overly banana or spice rack laden either.

It was very lively on the tongue With a nice level of carbonation. On the palate the flavor of banana and clove and a back note of bubble gum came through especially as the beer warmed while I was drinking it. It had a wonderful mouthfeel and was crisp without being overly dry. For the full experience I suggest taking out of your fridge and letting it stand 10-15 minutes before drinking it. Very good.

Smell: Pineapple, banana, wheat. Some notes of pepper and spice, but the fruity esters dominate in a lovely way.     Taste: Banana and bubble gum. What you'd expect of a hefe.

Bonus points for not tasting like banana puree. One of the better hefeweizens, I'll take this over most of the local craft versions I've had.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Look: Pours a hazy muted orange-yellow color with a dense two finger head that's made up of lots of effervescent tiny pinhole sized bubbles.    Smell: I'm getting heady aromas of banana, rosemary, bitter orange and lemon rind, marjoram and mild gingerbread on the nose.    Taste: Phenomenal. Initially it starts off with a spicy yeasty flavor on the tongue that's reminiscent of banana, graham cracker and clove. I taste notes of vanilla wafer cookies and savory apple strudel mid palate. It finishes off on a slightly bitter dry floral note with hints of honey. Perfectly balanced.    Feel: Light-medium body. Bubbly, crisp, refreshing and flavorsome. Starts off spicy and sweet but finishes dry and slightly bitter so as not to become cloying. The yeast adds a little roughness and weight to the feel and it works really well.    Overall: I'm not the biggest fan of Hefeweizens but this beer has shown me the light. My only negative criticism is that it doesn't lace the glass very well, but seriously who cares when you have a beer that tastes this good?

Smells of sweet fruit, citrus orange zest, wheat, and mild hops in back. Taste is very light fruit mix with back notes of some bakery goods or bread, mild wheat notes and finishes very clean and fresh. This is a fantastic beer for any season, I could drink this daily and never grow tired of it, awesome!   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 This is one of the prettiest beers to look at. Big foamy head and beautiful yellow-orange gold color, lots of carbonation. Smells very spicy and fruity, slightly fermented fruit, very sweet. Tastes crisp and also very spicy, cloves, and with some subtle fruitiness that isn't as strong as I think some people make it sound. This is a good thing, as I prefer the wheaty, honey drizzled bready flavors over sweet fruit. Feels super crisp and light, very refreshing and drinkable. Perfect for a warm, sunny day. Overall this is a veritable classic, and certainly deserves its acclaim.

I'm not gonna go into detail but the taste is phenomenal, it's got all those qualities that I enjoy in pilsners but also the smoothness of a wheatbeer, I also love that sour aftertaste. It might just be my new goto brand.

Pours a cloudy glowing burnt yellow with a fluffy creamy eggshell white head that sticks around leaving great thick retention and very sticky lacing. The aromas have lots of banana and cloves. Hints of bubblegum. The yeast does its thing. The flavors follow the nose perfectly. The flavors are extremely clean. More banana and cloves with some other subtle spice notes in the mix. More bubblegum. Subtle hints of citrus. The yeast blends well with everything. Solid malt backbone. Alcohol goes completely unnoticed. Mouthfeel is great. It's light with moderate carbonation. Very creamy and fluffy. Too smooth and easy to drink.     This beer is a classic. It's extremely refreshing and perfect for the warm weather, or anytime for that matter. The craftsmanship is very impressive. Highly recommended.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Been wanting to try this one for a while. The regular version of James Rolfe (the angry video game nerd)'s favorite beer. I heard many good things about it, had to give this one a try. Got a case from Market District for $12, which was a more than reasonable price. Doing this review on the spot.    Poured into a tall glass, its very pure looking. Faint yellow, massive head, very carbonated. The head lingers a long while. The first sip burns. This is a very carbonated beer. The flavor is great upon first impressions, no bitter beer taste, virtually no hops presence. You know its a wheat beer from drinking it. I have heard others say they got hints of bubblegum and banana from this? Not me. Its citrusy, its wheaty, its good. But I would definitely not say its sweet. Its an excellent sipping beer on a warm summer night.    Look: Quite beautiful. Looks like the perfect beer should look. Massive head, bubbly, beautiful yellow color.    Smell: citrusy, pure, literally can smell the history behind the beer. Its no surprise this stuff has been around for so long.    Taste: Delish. An outstanding beer taste. Not bitter one bit. Some citrus hints underneath the carbonation (which assaults the tongue) and a great finish which leaves you begging for more.    Feel: Ouch. Burning sensation from the carbonation which I find to be stimulating. I am used to belgian ales. Anyone that drinks bottle conditioned trappist ales are used to this feeling. I expect it and look forward to it.    Overall: Outstanding beer. Its the best of all worlds, though I am a belgian ale/trappist ale kind of guy, and also love pumpkin ales, this is probably my go-to beer now if I am not forking over all my money for expensive trappist ales or when pumpkin ale is out of season. This is for the serious beer drinker who drinks for the appreciation of a fine brew. Put down the Budweiser and give this a try, you won't regret it.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Served in a Paulaner hefeweizen glass, it pours a hazy, solid yet brilliant orange of a yellow hue. It forms a three-finger foamy and creamy head with seemingly everlasting retention.   A bevy of bubbles can be seen going to the surface from the very bottom of the glass, nurturing the head of the beer.   This beer gives a nice lacing.     Lots of banana, mild bubblegum, wheat malts, very strong biscuit, honey, citrus and clove. Assertive and enticing bouquet.    Excellently rounded and subtle.   Upfront the expressive carbonation is felt, and it accompanies the flavor all throughout.   Perfect balance, the sweet notes and the hoppy bitterness are equally present in that uniform yet complex flavor that the carbonation unveils.   Notes of overripe apple, pineapple, banana, biscuit, wheat malts, hay, honey and clove.  The aftertaste is long and slightly sweeter, that crispness dissipates.   Medium to full body, slightly silky and very refreshing.     The subtleties and sophistication of this beer's flavor speak for themselves.   World class beer for sure.

I didn't find any of the elements of this beer to be particularly special or fetching. I now know how those girls felt about me.

The beer is slightly sweet, honey, is full, dense, soft until the "fat".  Gentian low (IBU 14), completely satisfactory. High saturation in the direction of the average, ideal.

F: Light mouth feel with so many tiny bubbles it gives a very soft creamy sensation.  O:My favorite hefeweizen and a benchmark to judge others against. BANANA, CLOVE AND LEMON, YUMMY!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured 0.5l bottle into a Weizen glass.    A: Deep golden color and hazy (although clear for a Hefeweizen). Thick foamy white head, with excellent retention and very good lacing. High carbonation is visible in the glass.    S: Fresh citrusy notes (lemon/orange), followed by clove, bubblegum and hints of banana.    T: Taste follows the nose. Citrus flavors come first, clove follows, with light bubblegum flavor and banana subtly coming through in a sophisticated way. All perfectly balanced.    M: Feels light-to-medium bodied. Very smooth and crisp, with perfect amount of carbonation in the mouth.    O: Very refreshing and drinkable, with gentle velvety structure. I would call it a very sophisticated Hefeweizen. Variety of notes are delivered without allowing any of them to be too prevalent, but rather come together in a very nice balance.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Look: Pours a frosty straw color. The head is thick and white, and retains moderate to strong. A nice thin ring of foam sits on top of my beer after a few sips, with any lacing kicked up during the sip sinking back into the ring.     Aroma: Very delightful and playful with the quintessential notes of banana and clove playing a major role. A little Belgian yeast and pollen notes round it out nicely. It reminds me of summer nights spent in the farm fields here in the Midwest.     Taste: A good variety of notes are delivered, and all in balance. Those notes include banana, clove, Belgian spices, yeast, and a hint of pollen/flower. There are complexities that can be sniffed and sipped out, and yet it is just a plain ol' good beer to drink on a hot/warm day. An aftertaste leaves some Belgian yeast and spice on the palate between sips.     Mouth feel: It's well done, with a smooth, velvety texture, and a medium thickness consistency. It certainly keeps it fun and lively to drink.     Overall: This is a beer for any day drinking. The complexities in the aroma and flavor mean it can be sipped and savored or put down in under 60 at a barbecue. Very tasty and fun to drink.     Served in a 12oz snifter.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 This hefe pour a golden color with a thick white foamy head and a good amount of carbonation. The smell is mainly of wheat, but there is also a slight hint of banana as well. The body is light, but there is a nice full wheat and bready malt flavor and a little yeastiness as well. There is actually less fruit and spice flavor than I would have guessed with this one. There is a faint banana flavor in the aftertaste and a little bit of spiciness that lingers on the tongue, but that is about it. The finish is very crisp and a little bit dry. This is much more subdued than the dunkel. This is really an awesomely refreshing beer for a summer day. Everything here is really solidly done, but unpretentious like most German beers. I personally like the dunkel better because it’s slightly heavier and has a little more bold and complex flavors, but I could see how others might like this one better as well.

It was a guest draught at 'The Firefly' on Lowesmoor in Worcester.    The barman recommended it.    Came in a tall Weihenstephaner glass taken from the freezer.    Word's cannot really describe and sum up what I want to say about this world class beer.    It wasn't on tap very long and I tried to source the bottled (if any) variety. Some Sainsbury's in the UK stock it (Redditch one of them) and Ocado will deliver but it's quite a rarity on sale here.    I have tried many wheat beers over the years but this is heaven in a bottle.    A masterclass from Weihenstephaner.

This is probably my favorite Hefe with Ayinger running a close second.

Poured into a regular Pilsner glass. Crisp golden color with a lengthy head. Has a lot of banana in the smell/taste. Goes down very easily, just a smooth wheat beer. Glad I picked this one up, thanks to other BA reviews!

It is clean crisp and the clove and banana compliments the beer instead of overtaking it.

Nice straw yellow color with a fluffy white head, the taste of bananas comes through strong for one of the most pleasant beers you will find, especially on a hot day. My best friend who mostly drinks Bud Light says this is his favorite beer he has ever had, and I am happy to drink it with him.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 This is by far one of my favorite beers in the world. The look for starters is amazing a golden-honeyish hue is beautiful and the head that forms in the glass, whether it be from a bottle or on draught is perfect everytime. The smell is delicious, you get lemon, banana, wheat and i'd even go as far as to mention a hint of hazelnut. Just to die for. The taste is EPIC!!!!! Smooth, mellow, just the perfect combination of wheat, barley, hops, water and yeast. Yes, the perfect beer in my opinion.     If you see this on draught, in a bottle. DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY ONE!!! You won't regret it. I guarantee it.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 The pinnacle of a hefeweizen. One of the best beers I've ever had the full exceeds and raises the bar of what to expect with a hefe.    A - Pours a golden, honey color with a full, 3 finger head. Incredible head retention that never fully goes away.     S - Powerful and to the point. Banana and cloves. Not much else to say aside from an incredible aroma; no hidden subtleties.     T - The taste follows perfectly in line with the aroma. Optimal blend of bitterness and sweetness, leaving a lingering, banana aftertaste. Perfect match for my personal tastes.    M - Crisp, incredibly smooth and drinkable with the perfect amount of carbonation. Medium - full bodied beer.    O - As close to perfect a beer you'll find. As a big fan of hefeweizen's, I was estatic to finally get a hold of this beer. My expectations were well surpassed. From the moment you start pouring and as the aromas dissipate in the air around you; to the last sip, this beer will not let you down. Only downside - it's now going to be hard to find something that'll compare. Will be stocking the fridge.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Appearance: Pours a light honey color with the haze one would expect from a Hefe Weissbier. Shimmering gold in the glass. Brilliant fine textured cap with good lacing.    Aroma: Clove accented spices with ripe yellow fruit undertones. No noticeable hop presence.    Taste: Very gentle in a sophisticated way. This beer displays good manners. Not as full flavored as I've experienced in the past which could be due to it's age. Bottling date is 20 OCT 15 and it certainly wasn't kept under refrigeration since then. Perhaps not since it left the Brewery. Some other subdued flavors of banana and/or something similar but not enough to identify let alone quantify.    Overall: I cannot rate this based on what it may have been, only what it is. I bought it for the tasting and figured it would still be ok and it's just that, ok. In the past I've had other Bavarian Hefes that were much fresher and were quite frankly much better. This one seemed like a slightly deflated balloon.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 You have to love the intentional cloudy haze and the welcoming warm glow of this beer, punctuated by tiny bubbles feeding a rich white head. Good lacing lingers. Also the distinctiveness of the scent and flavor. There's a reason this is such a time-tested beer.    L - cloudy gold with streaming small bubbles, rich white head  S - sniff hard and this tingles the nostrils with spice; the quintessential clove and I'd say not too overwhelming on the banana. Some citrus/lemon detected.  T - sweetness and spice. Zesty and enjoyable.   F - tongue-tingling bubbles  O - excellent. I had this side-by-side with Paulaner Hefe-Weizen and both are great. Go to Paulaner, I think, for even more unbelievable head, though this one might have the slightly zippier taste. Again, both great.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 My 7th beer rated from this monastic brewery's 21 offerings on BA, so I think I've got a good sense of them.  It Looks like a hefe, but probably a little clearer and I got a big rocky head that dissipated.   Smells somehow lacked that classic banana I most like from the style.   Taste is balanced, the fruits and sweet wheat are kept in check with a healthy dose of hops.  Feel tells me the hops dosage is too healthy. Dry is OK, but this verges on bitter.  Overall, that bitter makes it difficult to go with food. Refreshing, yes. Food needs some sweeter malt in there for me.    Listed on the "1001", it probably very much deserves this... although I'm not a fan of spicy hefes.  Reviewed also in Roger Protz' CAMRA classic "300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"   
look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 A nice foamy beer, white and opaque white. The taste is out f the common for a white beer. This one will become easily in my top five.    The 500 ml glass bottle have a ABV of 5.4%. The foam stick to the glass and when the beer become to the room temperature, the taste change and is a bit better, drink by drink. The color is SRM 3.    Really nice beer overall.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier, 5.4% ABV, 14 IBU. Lots of head. Nose and taste is bread dough and bananas. Truly an excellent beer - if you haven't tried this then you are missing out. I took a chance on this one based on reviews and bought a 6-pack since I could not find a single. I suppose my favorite bottle shop might have cut one from the herd for me, but now I'm glad I bought the 6er. I recommend this highly, a must try. Wow!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Pours a beautiful golden amber with a nice plump and frothy three finger head of straight white foam.    Definite notes of banana, wheat, fresh grain, slightly spicy yeasty twang, and clove.    Clove, banana, yeasty spice, cereal grains, fresh baked bread.    Light-bodied, high carbonation, soft, creamy smooth, refreshing, incredible.    Overall, this truly stands out in the style as well as in general as a truly amazing beer. With this style it's difficult to stand out in aroma and flavor due to the subtle nuances, but this beer really provides for an awesome and silky smooth experience.

Serious aggressive, stiff head, white and lacy on the glass as I drank. Nose, yeast and bananas, some minimal grain scents. Pleasant and balanced. Taste: smooth and full, fruity with mild spices and of course the yeast, yet not too sweet. A bit of tingle to offset the creaminess. Too easy to drink too fast. Mouthfeel clean, but almost as though you'd just eaten something, not had a drink. Solid from start to finish.    Bottle poured into glass; label stamp read "6046" and "18 (I think) : 56 : 52."

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Bought a half liter, poured into a beer mug.  Look: Poured a hazy yellow with visible sediment, and a huge two-finger head that blossomed up out of the mug  Smell: Yeasty, skunky, heavy clove, and hints of mold.  Taste: Bright and sweet bubblegum flavor, undertones of banana, medium wheat body, vaguely musty  Feel: Very carbonated, rich, thick and heavy, sits in your stomach like a meal. Mildly refreshing but quite filling.  Overall: A solid traditional hefeweissen, but I noticed nothing as outstanding as other Weihenstephaner brews, like the Vitus. I'll have to pick this one up when Fall rolls around again.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Appearance: Poured a medium yellow with 2 fingers of bubbly, rocky ,slightly off white foam that reduced to a nice froth over several minutes.  Aroma: Sweet smell of fresh wet grass, wheat and yeast.  Flavor: I do not have the palate that others do so I am afraid I missed a lot of the different flavors that we're in this ale. What I did get was a delicious mix of sweetness that was crisp and clean.  Feel: Very smooth medium body with a semi-dry finish that leaves you wanting more.  Overall:Exceptionally great beer. First world class ale I have ever had.   It is a delicious and smoothe drink. I wish I had found this years ago as I now have a favorite go to beer with this.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Poured 11.2 oz bottle into snifter glass. 5.4% abv    Appearance- Pours a glowing honey yellow with high white head that hangs around the glass before receding.    Smell- Yeast, banana, clove    Taste- Fresh wheat base grain taste with hints of lemon. Picks up a bit midway into a more floral sweetness with a banana bread flavor. The banana notes hang around and rounds off the flavor profile with a clove/black pepper spice note.    Mouthfeel- Medium in body with active carbonation.    Overall- One outstanding hefeweizen to be had here. So smooth with a refreshing feel. The banana bread flavor really shines through in this one which is a showing of a fine hefeweizen. This one is as best as any for the style.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 I have been on a kick for Hef's since I had Funky Buddha's down in Florida. Had this years ago before the IPA craze and went back to it and it is out of this world delicious. So glad I revisited. Smooth, tart nose and nice banana apple taste with a dry finish. Will have this beer much more in the future. Ice cold makes it even better.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 On tap, pours a cloudy orange, like a light-colored apple cider. Smell is fruity and a little spicy, with definite clove and banana notes. Taste is classic wheat beer, with some tartness that offsets the fruitiness. Nice bready, yeasty finish. Not my favorite style, but I appreciate the quality.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Not much to say that hasn't already been said in someone else's review. I really got a strong pepper-y clove smell in it, but it was nice. Flavor is outstanding for a Hefeweizen - just so smooth and drinkable and the wheat flavor is really crisp.     What I found really cool is that this is a beer thats been brewed at a brewery operating since the 11th century and its amazing.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4 Light gold in color and very hazy. There's a solid inch of densely packed brilliant white foam on top. Heavy lacing. Aroma is comprised of faint banana esters and pale wheat. I taste very light pale wheat and faint banana esters. The mouth is very delicate, light, and faintly creamy.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Probably the most perfect hefeweizen there is and certainly the best I've had. Pours a hazy golden orange, looks beautiful held up to the light. Big, fluffy, off white head. Smells like the usual banana and cloves, with a hint of citrus. Taste is more or less the same, rich and full flavored but not overwhelmingly sweet or spicy like some hefes I've had. Just very well balanced. Feel is exceptional. I was amazed at how smooth and creamy this beer is while still maintaining great carbonation. Lingering, pleasant aftertaste on the finish. This beer is legendary for a reason!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Pours a murky straw color with half a finger fluffy white head. Nose is banana bread and cloves. Taste is similar: banana bread, cloves, pecans, subtle citrus. Nice long finish. Medium carb. Feel is slightly crisp. Overall, an excellent hefe. It absolutely lives up its reputation as the gold standard of the style.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 One pint .9 fl oz, coded 2365, poured into a Weihenstephaner hefe glass.     A - Cloudy golden orange/yellow with three fingers of fluffy white head that retains for a while.     S - Banana bread, yeast, clove/spices.    T - Right in line with nose, with some back end biscuit/cereal grains and lemon notes. As it warms, the yeast and spice move more to the forefront.     M.- Carbonation is a touch above medium. Feel seems both creamy and crisp.    O - Pretty tasty, if a little aged. Extremely well made, and holds up as the model for the style.
