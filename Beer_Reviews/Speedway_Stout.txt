It's rich, has wonderful coffee and chocolate notes, and it has a surprisingly thick body. It's a fantastic base and is one of my go-to stouts if I have the option.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 This is a great, big beer. I first tried the 2016 about a year ago, and while I liked it, I thought it was a little over hyped. Since then I have experimented with many beers, always tending toward stouts and porters. I don't know if this bottle has cellared better or if my pallet is more refined, but this beer goes right to the top. I'm no beer snob, but drinking this makes me feel like I am better than everyone else.

Nothing hits the spots during the cold winter time better than a well made Imperial Stout & the 12% alcohol is hidden well. This is a well made stout. I highly recommend this beer although it is a little pricey. This is a World Class beer. Cheers! A

The booziness that is usually present with this beer is gone and replaced with a sourness and stone fruit. . Chocolate. big coffee flavor that lingers. Orange peel. Get more grain smell as it warms. A little thin in texture which is not typical for this beer.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottle from 2014    A: Poured into a snifter to a deep black beer topped by a dense two finger light tan head which retains well and leaves decent lacing  S: Smells of intense roasted malts, dark chocolate and espresso  T: Taste is nice roasty malts with some bittersweet dark chocolate, italian roasted coffee, slight oxidation, hints of charred wood. Swallow is more roasted malts, charred wood, espresso, and dark chocolate.  M: This beer has a thick and silky body that's a little chewy. Carbonation is light but adequate for the style which contributes to a creamy mouthfeel while the beer has a drying finish.  O: Overall this one is rock solid. It represents the style well and has great flavors. It drinks really well and has some nice complexity going for it. It's definitely worth a try if you can find it.

look: 2.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 For one of the big famous Imperial Stouts in the world of craft beer, I don't think this guy is a serious competitor. As with Dragon's Milk, this is fairly bland for a RIS, but it's widely distributed and available year round, which I believe heavily contributes to its fame and fandom.    L: Very boring pour: even with a heavy hand, it barely produces a half-centimeter film of pale mocha brown head, and dissipates rapidly enough to evoke a nostalgic twinge of disappointment.    S: Smells tasty, but closer to a barleywine than a RIS. Milk Chocolate is the main player and he has his dudes, vanilla and coffee, backing him up. Some sour prunes and dried cherries try to make themselves known, but they get buried in toffee/caramel sweetness and roast. Licorice and a touch of perfumey leather lend a dryness to the finish.    T: Personally, I've never had an RIS that I couldn't taste alcohol in, but I agree some of them hide it better than others. This is one of those, without a doubt. Unfortunately, that's about the only great aspect of this beer, flavorwise. Very sugary, very forgettable. There's a bit of a cantaloupe melon aspect to the sweetness, but it needs more roast, and really lacks complexity overall. Perfect salt level though, with a lovely pretzel note for the finish.     F: Even among imperial stouts, this has a syrupy texture and a cloying finish. It has a bit of dryness that helps, but it's not enough to balance with the sugar.    O: A very nice RIS, but I absolutely would not rank it as one of the world's 10 greatest stouts, nor even the world's 100 greatest. It's better than Dragon's Milk, at least.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Inky black body; dense, creamy, light tan head; curtains of foam along the glass. Roasted grain aroma infused with a mildly fruity component; dates; cocoa. Milk chocolate and charred grain flavors; muted booziness; dates; a bit of coffee. Heavy body; mostly smooth but also delivering a low-key crisp and dry abrasiveness in the background; alcohol warmth.    A big, powerhouse stout, that does an excellent job of blending dense, dark grain sweetness with an edgy alcohol note.

Beautifully balanced with just enough bitterness to balance  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a light creaminess and a light carbonation   Finish: Roasted malt and bitterness lingers on the finish with a touch of dark chocolate   Overall: Beautifully balanced for an imperial story with coffee. Profile is insanely smooth throughout, from aroma thru the finish. Dark chocolate and toffee are most prevalent, but a lightly roasted coffee note balances while remaining smooth. A light creaminess tonthe body helps blend the flavors together. This beer has 2 years of age, and stands upbas a top notch imperial stout

AROMA: Dark roasted malt, dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, toffee, and it's a bit earthy. Wee bit of alcohol, and a little leather and tobacco, as well.  TASTE: All of the above, with a very mild, but, lingering bitterness. Actually, well balanced between sweet and bitter.   FEEL: Full body, average carbonation level, a little sticky, and dries up on the finish, a bit.  OVERALL: Damn nice stout.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Canned 2/1/17, consumed 7/14/18    L: Deep, dark black with a nice thick dark tan head that left a good amount of lacing.    S: Big, well-rounded aroma blend of roasted malts and coffee, with slightly lesser tones of chocolate and caramel.    T: Follows aroma with a noticeable level of sweetness, delicious and again just wonderfully blended.    F: Wow, absolutely standout amazing - medium, smooth & creamy, NO TRACE at all of the high level ABV (seriously this stout hides alcohol better than ones with half the ABV). Little bitterness that fits in very nicely. Just a perfect feel that immediately invites another sip.    O: This beer certainly deserves every piece of recognition that it gets. Very refined in all aspects. It's pricey, but it's a noticeable level up over your everyday imperial stouts.

Smell: Big aromas of roasted malts, chocolate, toffee, caramel and dates. Slight coffee presence on the nose accompanied by a slight booze burn. As it warms, the coffee and dark fruit comes out a little more. Chocolate is huge component of the smell.   Taste: Follows the nose. Roasted malt and chocolate are the big players in the taste. Dark fruit flavor is in abundance. Slight notes of caramel and butterscotch. The initial taste is chocolate and malt, and the finish is semi-sweet with slight bitterness. Residual flavor is sweet yet smoky. The booze is overall well hidden, but is slightly detectible. Coffee is prevalent in the taste, but isn't as strong as I would have thought.   Feel: Smooth and pleasant on the tongue. Medium in body and weight, with moderate to high carbonation for the style. Easy to drink.   Overall: A fantastic stout, and one that I would repeatedly come back to. It has just the right amount of sweetness without becoming overly sweet. I am very grateful to have tried, and would happily recommend. Cheers!

But I think a nice spring day is an occasion enough.   Actually I was waiting for someone ti share it with, I didn't find someone worthy enough.    As i pour from the easy looking 1 pt 9.4 fl. oz. I can see a a gorgeous pitch black body. As it goes it forms a nice beige head    Now I can make an aproach with my big white nose and smell the beauty.  I can tell you right now, this is the best part of the beer. What's amazing is that vanilla is all around in this coffee imperial stout. Ok coffee is there too. In a latte form. Caramel, chocolate, and a certain je ne sais quoi.    As my tongue comes across the ale, it shows its balance with a soft sweetness. The roasty bitterness does the rest. The hops are still present with a bergamote/earl grey presence alongside blueberries.     The smooth mouthfeel brings just what you need to compliment the flavours.     This is one of the first coffee imperial stout. It's nothing compared to what coffee beers are right now. This is no pastry stout. This is a beer. This a much refined beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2018 dated 16 oz can, slightly chilled. Poured moderately fast, which created very little mocha head that didn't last long. Nose is rich coffee, maybe fig and caramel. First sip brings light licorice and caramel sweetness, with the coffee more in the back than expected. Mouthfeel is creamy, full, with lasting dark chocolate aftertaste. Alcohol seems completely hidden...dangerous (stealing another reviewer's term). After warming, it just gets creamier while keeping its mocha, chocolate, coffee, fig, licorice balance. Really delicious and much too easy to tip back until empty. About ten minutes after finishing, the alcohol came to visit, reminding me this is strong beer! If it's this good fresh, I'll need several cans to cellar. Pricey for the area, but what else would I do with my money?

I drank this within 1 month of purchase.    Appearance: Very dark black with a three finger high tan/brown head. Head is creamy and thins out to about 1/4 finger, and leaves a little lacing on the glass, more lacing than most other stouts but not nearly as much as with IPAs.    Smell: Strong aroma of chocolate, roasted coffee, and caramel. There is some additional sweetness from malts. Not much hop aroma. A little earthy, maybe oak aroma.    Taste: There is an interesting combination of flavors. There is strong chocolate flavors along with caramel. Also some smoky roasted malt flavors, and coffee flavors. There is a little bitterness from hops, but the caramel, chocolate, and coffee flavors dominate. There is a strong alcohol presence that matches 12% on the label.     Mouth-feel: Thick, but with an extremely smooth and creamy body.    This is a very good Imperial Stout, and it has a variety of flavors that adds a nice complexity to the beer. It is very smooth and enjoyable to drink. I would definitely buy this again.

It was not overwhelming and tasted like "normal" but strong stout. It was very good.    Look: black with a thick mocca colored head    Aroma: roasted malts, coffee, chocolate    Taste: Roasted malts, a little bit of milk chocolate and cream, and a significant amount of coffee, slightly boozy but the right amount.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Black with a creamy tan head. Heavy, sticky lacing.     Strong roasted malts, a little cream and a faint whiff of alcohol in the nose. Whatever coffee is there is very muted.    In the taste the nice roasted malt flavors are coupled with a strong sweetness -- there's a bit of chocolate and cream to it, but it's straight-up sugary, too. I wouldn't call it a dessert stout, but it's close. The coffee isn't very forward at this age, but there is a tasty flash of it in the aftertaste.    Very thick, creamy mouthfeel with just enough carbonation.    This is a bit too sweet for me to revisit often, but it's still very solid. Hard to read the canned on date, but it looks like 1/24/17, which could account for the muted coffee.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I am writing this review on the basis of a two year aging experiment. Pours a touch thin and has a light khaki head around the edge of the glass. Considering the age it smells like stale roast and alcohol. Taste is heavily milk chocolate. Feel is just the slightest tad carbonated. Overall this beer is better fresh with the strong coffee notes. Those notes devolve in to mills chocolate but the stale roast flavor predominates throughout and detracts from the aging experiment. Definitely better fresh.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured to an Ora et Labora taster.    A: The body is not very syrupy when pouring, was expecting a bit more for the given alcohol contents. The body is pitch black and the head is beige to faded yellow. Not much retention nor lacing.  S: The aroma is very very roasty, with tons of chocolate, coffee, caramel and even a bit of vanilla. The aroma is pure awesomeness.  T: Following the aroma, starts off with a vanilla-like and caramel sweetness profile. Right after, a milk chocolate and sweet coffee is present with a very prominent style. In the end, a slight sweet end turns this beer so awesome and drinkable.  M: Body is medium high, carbonation is high, sweetness is high but alcoholic contents are too prominent.  O: It's true, this is classic beer. Truly awesome.

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Welcome to The CANQuest (tm), Sppedway Stout! This was a relatively spendy CAN, but since I have been spending the day drinking & reviewing Stouts, I decided to bring this one into the fore.     From the CAN: "Speedway Stout's ominous, pitch black appearance has become a hallmark of the modern-day classic. Chocolate and roasted malts dominate the flavor, supported by notes of dark fruit, toffee, and caramel. A healthy dose of locally-roasted coffee added to each batch brings out the beer's dark chocolate flavors and enhances its drinkability. Despite its intensity, Speedway Stout's fine carbonation and creamy mouthfeel make it very smooth and surprisingly easy to drink. This beer ages very well and will continue to mature for many years to come."; "This beer's great balance makes it a very food-friendly imperial stout. Pair its roasty flavors and robust mouthfeel with rich beef dishes and char-grilled foods. Both chocolate and vanilla desserts also pair well, as do salty blue cheeses like Stilton or hard nutty cheeses like aged Gouda and cloth-bound Cheddars."    I Crack!ed this bad boy open, but as much as I wanted to do an inverted Glug, its price tag & quantity (16-fl. oz.) held me back from anything more than a slow pour. It did not matter as its intense carbonation immediately led to the formation of two fingers of dense, foamy, light-brown head with great retention. Color was absolutely Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Jeez-O, man, this was sucking the light out of the room! Nose smelled intensely of rich, black coffee, the kind that must be coaxed into my coffee pot each morning as the filter clogs due to the amount of grounds that I use. I am a retired U.S. Navy sailor & I still run on smokin' coffee. Sure, there was also dark chocolate, light smoke & the dried, dark fruits that they mentioned, but coffee was the star of the show. Mouthfeel was thick, full & creamy, just what I had been missing this afternoon. The taste was an instant jumpstart to my heart! Coffee came on strong, followed closely by dark, bittersweet chocolate and then the fruitiness began to open up along with the toffee & caramel flavors. Whee! OMFG. Phew. What a riotous beer! I almost CANnot believe that they deigned to CAN such a beast, but I am not CANplaining. Finish was dry and very coffee-like, just what I had hoped for. Phew! It is only its price point that slows me down from buying additional CANs.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from 16oz can into glass. Stamped canning date is sometime in 2017, but otherwise illegible.  Pours a pure black body, with bubbly, thick tan head, extensive coverage of lacing.  Smells of dark roasts, coffee, chocolate, and slightly sweeter caramel.  Taste bursts with dark chocolate and coffee, with roasty and caramel malts at the end. A slight alcohol burn in the noise.  Silky, medium, coating mouth feel.  Excellent example of an imperial stout with coffee.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 From a can. It pours jet black with a finger worth of tan head. The aroma is of coffee and chocolate with some nice sugary and caramel-like sweetness to it. The taste is of espresso, dark chocolate, and some roasted grains. Very viscous and it coats the tongue nicely. Little in the way of booziness despite the fairly high ABV.

It isn't a harsh coffee...or chocolatey beer...but manages to hit it perfectly while throwing in some vanilla. Honestly the most important to me is it doesn't end up tasting like a chemical mess like some of the others I have had.     Drinking this is really a little too easy for a 12% beer.

It pours jet black with a mocha head that dissipates quickly leaving minimal spotty lacing. The aroma is dark chocolate and coffee. Taste is similar with the addition of dark roasted malts and a hint of vanilla. Good heat from the 12% ABV. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, not as thick as some, but far from watery. Excellent imperial stout.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottled on 8/28/15; 2 years of age in a 750ml bomber.    Pours black in color with almost no head/ head retention. The little head there is coffee colored.    Aroma smells like a slightly booze-forward mocha. Tons of chocolate and coffee. Undertones of vanilla and a kiss of booze.    Taste is creamy in mouthfeel; it's not super thick and chewy (i.e. Ten Fidy) but definitely not a watery stout. More unsweetened chocolate and cold brewed coffee. Absolutely delicious.    Overall, this is a phenominal beer. It compares easily to that of ten fidy and FBS. I would buy again. I see this pairing well with chocolate dipped strawberries. It gets a 92/100.   
look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Well looks like I finally got my hands on AleSmith Speedway Stout, and this thing is monolithic at 12% ABV - I mean it’s going to be a BIG (Bearing Immense Gusto) brew. Plus as a coffee stout it has some epic competition in the likes of Founders Breakfast Stout and my recent favourite Omnipollo Selassie Stout... it almost makes you wonder “If I was a brewer would I even want to throw my hat into the coffee stout ring”? It’s like placing your head inside the lions jaw (to borrow another circus metaphor). AleSmith are no slouches though - they know how to brew a BIG one. Time to bring out my “big book of words that describe the colour black” again... obsidian? Yeah we’ve heard that one before!    Poured from a 473ml can into a Duvel tulip.    A: Presents an opaque stygian atramentous [see, I found an even more complicated word to describe obsidian!] body with a pretty decent mocha head that hangs in there like a champ (given the 12% ABV). This doesn’t look as motherf__king ominous as other American Imperial Stouts, but perhaps this is the calm before the shitstorm? 8/10.    S: Nose is quite a bouquet of rich coffee bean, chicory, charred wood, oak, dark fruits (prune/plum), and a touch of brandy... and this next statement feels very Douglas Adams-like but: what a fragrant beer this speedway is. Look it’s a damn epic aroma - there’s no escaping it - it’s a black hole of an aroma: sucking in my olfactory senses into it like a dying star. 10/10.    T: Mmmmm-f__king-tastic! Creamy AF, but we’ll get to that, all of the above: coffee bean, chicory, charred wood, oak, prune, plum, touch of brandy, yes please sir! Plus, PLUS: it doesn’t taste anything near 12% ABV (‘cept for a little warming in the aftertaste). Pure genius AleSmith! [insert a bit more hyperbole here] Now some bad points: finish is slightly more bitter than wanted/warranted, and the coffee character isn’t as prominent as in FBS or Selassie... but damn this: spot hit. 9/10.    M: Heavy bodied, reasonably viscous, not quite Founders body (but nothing I’ve found yet beats Founders body), creamy-super-dense carbonation. 9/10.    D: Was not expecting this to come close to FBS but Speedway really does manage to come close, were it not for that bitter edge and the coffee flavour being less than prominent I might have been able to crown my new favourite coffee stout - but sorry FBS still claims that title by a narrow margin. 8/10.    Food match: I feel like smoking cigars in a totally non-exclusionary club right now.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 (bomber bottle, bottled 01/27/1? - last number mangled, but it looks like a 5 or 6 - wouldn't surprise me if it is a 5, given that the store from where I purchased this routinely has old bottles on the shelves... poured into a teku)    L: nearly jet black liquid; buff brown, flighty foam... little foam retention, leaves almost no collar    S: deeply malty, over-baked cookie, bitter black chocolate... coffee barely pokes thru, very little booze... floral phenol, hints of dark fruit (vinous)    T: moderate, bordering on assertive roasted grain, supported and tamed by an underlying semi-sweet toffee flavor... mellow bitterness, citrus peel-like in its flavor, possibly some faint black tea... touch of ash and molasses in the aftertaste, later some subtle menthol and nuttiness emerges... malt is fairly dense throughout    F: medium-bodied, not quite edging toward full/thick - thinned out well by understated yet enlivening ethanol    O: good - nothing distinct/memorable flavor-wise... rather mellow and refined (by age?) for its ingredients and listed strength... seems like it's in a faded state (which is great for drinking), but I'd prefer to try this more fresh next time   
look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5 L: Pitch black with a creamy light brown head. A massive head is produced that leaves a surprisingly lasting creamy brown cap that leaves copious sheets of lacing.    S: Tons of umami/soy sauce, fudge brownie, cinnamon/clove spice, dark chocolate, gingerbread, fruitcake, date, fig, raisin.    T: Gentle waves of milk chocolate, cocoa, and malted milk balls upfront, which then immediately leads way to a MASSIVE punch of increasingly complex malts and roast. Dark chocolate, fudge, gingerbread, snickerdoodle cookies, caramel, and spice cake. A light espresso roast, a burnt edge, an earthy bitterness that keeps the chocolate and cake roast in check. There's a mild soy sauce note pervading the beer, but it's not as prominent as the nose suggests; but it's still there. Finishes lightly sweet but with a touch of dryness, and an almost green pepper vegetal bitterness, perhaps from the coffee. Fantastic.    F: Pretty much full-bodied. Smooth and creamy, super rich and bready. Feels a little thin on the mid-palate. It's not quite as chewy and milkshake-like as Ten Fidy and some other contemporary imperial stouts, but it's still pretty thick. A moderately high carbonation makes it super easy to drink.    O: An absolutely fantastic imperial stout. The coffee character was barely detecable, but I don't know how old this can is. Regardless, this is fantastic, world-class stout.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 750 ml bottle served reasonably cold into a pint glass. Purchased while visiting the US for half of an arm and a quarter of a leg. :)    Appearance - Ominous black, engine oil like viscocity and an impressive finger and a half of deep tan / beige / brown foam that had impressive staying power.    Smell - An absolute molasses monster, licorice prevalent, treacle mixed in as well. Coffee is there as well, but well saturated in the background and subtle touches of vanilla make it through as well. An absolute malt bomb. Love this nose.    Taste - Molasses and licorice are the reals stars here overshadowing everything yet allowing a little quality time for vanilla, coffee, and bits of tobacco and leather. Seeing as I am someone who really enjoys the maltiness of molasses and licorice flavors this is dreamy. Just a little less coffee than I was expecting / hoped for.    Mouthfeel - Smooth yet thick and definitely chewy. Carbonation is medium and body is thick. Just right for an intensely flavored stout.    Overall - A really excellent stout that met expectations, but maybe didn't exceed them. No real qualms here (other than the high price, but that can be expected for a 12% imperial stout) other than i wish the coffee shone through just a bit more. Surprisingly drinkable for such a big and molasses / treacle and licorice forward beer, I could see myself purchasing another bottle, however the option of a 4 pack of other world class stouts is often a little too much to pass up. Highly recommended for any serious purveyor of beers and especially for those with an affinity for licorice and molasses forward beers.

Appearance: Deep, inky dark brown with a short, dense head of brown foam and speckle lace.    Smell: Rich aroma of coffee beans, caramel, and chocolate truffles.    Taste: Deep, roasted malt flavors; coffee, dark fruit, burnt caramel, dark chocolate, and an earthy, bitter close. Warming, numbing alcohol as it warms.    Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation and a creamy, smooth feel.    Overall: Massively flavorful but still balanced - intense while still very drinkable.

Okay retention; sheets of lacing. (4)    S:  Rich, intermingled layers of roastiness. Molasses, coffee, cocoa powder, toffee. (4.5)    T:  Mmmm. Maply sweet roasted malts, coffee and sugar, chocolate, toffee, burnt caramel. (4.5)    M:  Full body with light carbonation and a to h feel, lingering treacle and toast finish. (4.5)    O:  A really really nice beer.  It looks good enough for gov't work but the rest is the tits. Everything is cohesive and together but still strong enough to be easily teased apart. Very sweet with a nice balancing roast bitterness. Thick and velvety. Like espresso with maple ice cream. Truly a great beer.  Will have again. I'm curious to see how the other can I got is in a year or so. (4.5)

Nose is alcohol, roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. Taste follows with sweetness, before a moderate bitter close. Fairly smooth, decent mouthfeel. Overall excellent, though a bit more bitterness than I prefer. It is improving as it - and I - warm.

Tastes of roasted malts, chocolate, mild coffee, and with some alcohol. Medium-heavy in body and medium in carbonation, with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall it's a delicious imperial stout. Only complaint is the alcohol is a little more prevalent than I'd like, but with age I bet it would be perfect.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Seems to pour jet black but when you hold a thin layer to the light it is a dark red-brown. Very little head, nice sticky lacing. Aroma hits you primarily with coffee, and secondarily with chocolate, vanilla, and a tiny bit of sarsaparilla, nutmeg, and malty sweetness. Taste consists of all of the above, as well as a bit of roasted malt, brown sugar, slight spice, a bit of hops. Nothing too dry/bitter/burnt, not overly attenuated but not cloyingly sweet either. Full bodied with light carbonation. Just a perfectly crafted, scrumptious and practically chuggable 12% ABV stout. My only criticism would be a bit heavy on the coffee - but that's the point, I guess.

The entry is very dry as well as the mouth-coating finish. The malt character is dry and granular like nine grain bread. There are notes of coffee, cherry and chocolate in the taste. There are also notes of herbal teas with cinnamon and basil. The taste covers up the alcohol very nicely. From the smell I mostly get chocolate. Extremely well rounded stout with a complex profile.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 The appearance had a one finger tan foamy head that dies within thirty seconds maintains a slightly thick lacing. The smell had roasted coffee up front, raisin tries to come in fairly strong along with the coffee, but mainly stays just a tad behind, black licorice also tries to power its way through, but is just a tad more subdued then the other two aromas, for the most part I’m impressed how all three are coming through as powerful as they are. The taste was a dry roasty coffee, slightly sweet through the raisins and leaves a dry roasty yet also kinda toasty sort of coffee aftertaste, dry bitter coffee finish. On the palate, it sat at/about a medium to heavy, actually probably closer to heavy, sessionable - not really but makes a good sipper. Carbonation seems to be good for the style and for me - dry and slightly smooth, coffee-like coating the tongue and mouth. Overall, wow, this is a pretty good American Double / Imperial Stout.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a 1 Pint CAN (right??). Can recommends to drink from a gobblet at 50-55 F, but I can't wait to let it warm up: going in blind.    Pours an oily black color with a dense caramel, khaki-colored head. Head dissipates into a thin ring around the glass after a minute or two, traces of bubbles cling to the glass...it's like a cave formed from bubbles.    Smell: At first, didn't smell too much (probably too cold), but the more I sniff the better it gets: lots of dark fruits and coffee, faint caramel.    Mouthfeel: Too busy savoring the taste to even notice mouthfeel.    Taste: Sweet Mary and Joseph! If there is a coffee wine, this might be it. First, almost no alcohol taste. That in itself is impressive for a 12% beer. (Impressive... and dangerous, but I LIKE DANGEROUS!)  Speedway goes down like a tsunami of roasted coffee, deep, savory dark fruits and smoky caramel. Bazinga!     If this is your first stout/imperial stout, don't drink it! You'll ruin every other stout you touch. For real. This is one of those beers that having swallowed a mouthful if you breath in again, you can still taste it in your mouth. It's a jealous beer that takes up every single tastebuds from first sip to last.     I don't know why it's called "speedway;"   I think "sideways" is more appropriate.     What a beer. Woof.

The perfect balance between bitterness, sweetness, creaminess and carbonation. This has got to be as good as it gets for a barrel-free stout.

No details about the bottled date so not sure about the aging but shouldn’t be an issue for this big Stout.    Murky black in color with thick frothy khaki head as a showcase, the head retains very well with good retention and slowly dissipates to a long-lasting bubble film on the surface also leaves lots of sticky lacing here and there.    In a nose, rich and dark milky chocolate, black coffee, mocha, cocoa, toasted and roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, dark bread, charred nut, tobacco, modest sweetness, mild dark fruit, licorice, and a slight hint of spicy alcohol, all you could imagine from great big Stout, they are all packed here.    The taste is dominated and led by all kinds of chocolate and roasted malt at first. Then it is supported by coffee, cocoa, toasted nut, vanilla, caramel, toffee, dark bread, dark fruit, licorice, sweetness from both malt and alcohol, boozy spice with some warming touch, and strong bitterness mostly from roasted and toasted profile. The end is wrapped up and lingering with intense roasted flavor.    Full body with creamy smooth mouthfeel and some sticky touch through the palate, the feeling is not too hefty while being not too watery despite holding rather low carbonation. In fact, it is crisp enough and proper to carry all the things well. Finish is very dry.    This one is totally blow me away. It is among ones of the best Stout available out there. For me, I think from tap is more mellow and smooth while from bottle is more aggressive and intense. Anyway, it is great in whatever you choose.

The beer is black and forms 1/2 a finger of khaki colored head. It seemed thick while pouring. The head has good retention.    S: [3.75] Bourbon, cherry, dates, tobacco. The nose is prominent and forward. Start to get the coffee as it warms.    T: [3.75] Marshmallow, chocolate, charred wood.    M: [4.25] Thick and chewy. It is dense. But it has more carbonation tingle than I expected. There is also some alcohol that stacks up if you sip too many times too quickly.    O: [4.00] For 12% it is really well hidden. The body is thick. You have to sip it. I got a lot less coffee than I expected. The flavor overall is nice along with the nose. This is something that you need to save for a special occasion. I am not a cigar smoker but I predict this would pair really well. As this warms and mellows it continues to get batter and better.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 One of my favorite beers. Bottle poured into a snifter.    The appearance is thick and black with a compact 1 finger mocha head that lasted well. Alcohol is barely noticeable and it goes down smooth.    The aroma is very vibrant with chocolate, vanilla, dark fruit and roasted malts. Some alcohol spice starts to creep in at this point.    The taste as you would expect follows the nose with chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits, and a nice bready malt sweetness.     This is such an excellent beer that has stayed very consistent. Can't wait to try a barrel aged version of Speedway.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Look - dark mahogany body with beige head    Smell - roasted coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, caramel    Taste - much like the nose, chocolate, roasted malts, caramel, coffee, hint of booze    Mouthfeel - medium bodied, medium carbonation, roasted flavor upfront from the malts/coffee, low amount of sweetness frim the chocolate, roasted malts in the finish, slight hint of booze - this beer is smooth for the ABV    Overall - this is a really good example of an Imperial Stout, good balance of flavor and the booze is present yet restrained. My only gripe with this beer is the price point - too high to drink on a regular basis.    Price Point - $7.99/16 oz can

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Bottle, aged 1 year and a half. The bottle serves a black liquid with a quite big brown head.

Medium sweetness, roasted malt , chocolate, with a nice coffee presence, it is very good, the alcohol content isn't a problem at all, we barely feel it. Creamy, full body. One of the best Imperial Stout you can find out there!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured out of a fairly fresh 16oz can bought at Coastal Wine in Branford. Super thick and inky black, small head. You can tell just by appearance this is one boozy brew. Illustrious aroma that has tons of malt, roast, coffee, chocolate, and toffee but somehow hides the ethanol burn that typically defines higher ABV beers. Flavor is a sledgehammer of dark malt, all the descriptions from the aroma come in over the tongue. Very espresso like but with a good amount of sweetness, too. Silky smooth feel and heavy body leaves you feeling quite satiated about 2/3s of the way through. It's definitely a sipping beer. Bought another can to hang onto for next winter. See you in 10 months!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Very dark beer with a minimal brown head. Aroma is weak for a bigger stout. Faint smells of coffee but, compared to other stouts not very provocative. Tastes fantastic. Low carbonation, a fully body, and smooth to a slight bitter finish.    Really tastes like I expect a great stout to taste. It doesn't mask flaws with strange flavors or overpower you with the flavor of the month. Just a quality beer with staying power.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Everything a stout should be. Pours dark brown/black with a medium brown head and some lacing towards the top of the glass. Aroma is the weakest part of this brew - dark chocolate with slight hints of espresso and dark fruits. Taste is more coffee than chocolate with vanilla and some dark fruits. I felt that the light carbonation worked perfect. A bit silkier and this would have gotten a solid 5. Overall, if the coffee aromas came through a bit more, this really would have been a knock out of the park for me. Still though, an excellent stout. I'd love to have this aged in bourbon barrels or with any sort of a twist Alesmith throws on this. Also would be interesting to age for a year or 2.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 This is just a fantastic beer and I'm having a hard time thinking of a better coffee Stout that isn't barrel aged.    Look: pitch black with a nice tan head that came up about two fingers and yielded some excellent lacing.    Smell: Very pungent roasted coffee and chocolate on the nose.    Taste: The ABV is just so well hidden, just lots of coffee, toasty chocolate, bit I'm vanilla and maybe fig(?) throughout, and what disntinctly reminds me if cold brew coffee in the finish.    Feel: creamy and full without ever feeling overbearing. Some heavy dark beers are very easy to take your time with because​ of how hefty they are but this one begs you to take that next sip.    Overall: If you see it and you like stouts, buy it. Hell, buy two!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 16 oz. can poured at 50° into a tulip. Canned roughly 2.5 months ago.    Pitch black with a finger of rock solid reddish-brown head. I can see my reflection. Appears slightly viscous in the glass.    Nose is chocolate, coffee, maple syrup, earth, wood, vague barrel characteristics even though it's not BBA. Suggestions of peppermint and holiday spice.    The taste is where things take a left turn, unfortunately. Right from the jump there's an almost mouth-enveloping sweetness that borders on too much. Chocolate and coffee are there, but they're all but ruled out by caramel-y sugar, which caught me off guard. Oddly addicting to a point but not really my cup of tea. More red fruit and caramel than mocha.     Full-bodied, but ultimately not in a good way. It's like a sugar cube dissolving on your tongue.     Is it this particular can, or am I just not jivin' with this? Awesome look and smell, but a let down from there.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This stout pours a pitch black color with a medium foamy off white head. The smell is very malt heavy with roasted grains, coffee, dark chocolate, and burnt sugar notes. The taste is similar with all the flavors coming out in abundance, but the coffee and roasted grains are especially prominent. The body is very heavy. The finish is extremely smooth and there is really no trace of alcohol, which is a bit surprising in a 12% beer. This is a dangerously drinkable imperial stout for sure. This isn’t that complex, but the flavors are amazingly on point and it’s just a really well done example of the style. A classic imperial stout in my opinion.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Tasted in snifter from draft at O'Toole's on April 7, 2017. Look is black with a thick dark tan head and little lacing. Smell and taste is coffee and dark chocolate with roasted and caramel malt flavors. Feel is full in body with a clean, crisp finish.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 From a can dated 1/27/17    L: Pitch black with a good amount of creamy light tan head that lasts awhile.  S: Coffee and lots of it. Followed with some caramel and malt smell.  T: Coffee but with something sweet, no bitter aftertaste like other coffee stouts.   F: Medium bodied feel with light carbonation, very smooth.   O: Really solid coffee stout, like this one a lot. Guess I am going to have to pony up for the big bottle to see the difference between the 2.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Picked up from Total Wine & More in Woodland Hills, CA. Poured from a 1 Pint can into a Smuttynose Stout glass.    Look: Pours a jet black with a small head of tan foam. Consistent lacing that dissipates slowly.  Smell: Very evident coffee notes that fades and is replaced with an awesome bitter but sweet chocolate balance. Even getting initial hints of black cherry.  Taste: Bitter cacao nibs, coffee, toasty malts in the finish. Slight breadiness throughout that really enhances the strong chocolate malt and coffee.  Feel: Awesome mouthfeel, and with a smooth but heavy body, really the only indicator of the fact that this beer rings in at 12% ABV. Sticky, very low carbonation, incredibly smooth.    Overall, this beer is incredible. I'd heard nothing but good things and I knew it was a must have. For me this stands tall with North Coast's Old Rasputin but with that more prevalent chocolate that I feel was the only thing I could critique about Rasputin. I'd be curious to see if there were any profile differences when poured from Alesmith's bottled Speedway Stout.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Despite what is stated on the packaging, I strongly suggest drinking this at ~62 degrees.     L -- This is the darkest beer I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. 1,000 lumens (roughly the power of a car headlamp) passed through the glass reveals... nothing. Nada. Absolutely no light passed through the pitch blackness that is this brew. 2-finger tan head produced with moderate pour. Great retention and moderate lacing.   S -- Coffee, well-roasted barley malts, bittersweet chocolate, fruity yeast esters, molasses, caramel, toffee, and vanilla  T -- A perfect balance between a molasses/caramel/toffee sweetness and intense flavors of espresso, dark chocolate, and a rich earthiness. Tastes like a well-made coffee ice cream that's been melted and turned into a 12% ABV beer.   F -- Thick, chewy, and velvety, yet immensely drinkable thanks to the perfect levels of carbonation and sweetness.   O -- From start to finish, this is hands down the best stout I've had. Blows Breakfast Stout, Old Rasputin, etc. out of the water. In Massachusetts, though, it's pretty damn pricey at ~$9 for a 16 oz. can.    91/100    EDIT (11/13/17):  Still blown away by the soft, thick mouthfeel on this. It does indeed taste like a melted coffee ice cream

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Can dated 02-01-17 into pint glass. Pours a thick, viscous, inky black with a minuscule medium-tan head. Initial impression is sweetened coffee, molasses, dark chocolate, caramel, and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Carbonation is very light. Finish is more of the same, with a noticeable alcohol afterburn.   This could easily be a recipe for a sticky, cloying, syrupy mess, but it never approaches that. Alesmith has somehow produced an almost perfect balance of complementary flavors that play extremely well together.   I have a second can that's going to be cellared for a year or so. Looking forward to sampling that one!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Bottled on 12/15/15.    Poured straight down into the glass there's almost no head. Almost pitch black with the exception of the dark brown tinge near the top when held to light.     Smells like coffee and malt mostly.     Given that this bottle is over a year old, the taste is definitely different, but only in a subtle way. The strong coffee flavor from the original fresh Speedway is more subdued in this older bottle, and the roasted malt comes out more. As it warms there's a lot of sweet chocolate and brown sugar, among other similar flavors.     On the palate it seems the same as the fresh bottle: thick and chewy, but not completely syrupy.     Overall, I like the year-old bottle, but surprisingly not as much as the fresh. The coffee and chocolate have slightly faded (not much, though). Despite this, it's still a wonderful beer that's well worth buying and experimenting with aging.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Very dark thick looking much like dirty motor oil with a nice smell of coffee and dark fruits and a hint of booze. Tastes like coffee and raisons with a very boozy finish almost like a world wide stout but with less abv which brought this down for me as I was expecting a more predominantly coffee flavor as opposed to a strong alcoholic malt flavor. Has a heavy full bodied mouth feel and very smooth with slight carbonation. Overall this is still a decent stout but very boozy.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 A 750ml foiled bottle with no clear bottled on or best before date. Poured into a snifter glass.    Appearance: Black in colour with a just over one finger tanned head that had good retention and left great lacing.    Aroma: Roasty malts, dark chocolate, coffee, caramel with hints of vanilla and dark fruit.    Taste: Follows the aroma with roasted malts, dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, vanilla, coffee and dark fruits.    Mouthfeel: Creamy, velvety and smooth. Full bodied with light carbonation and light warming alcohol booze.    Overall: A very nice classic Imperial Stout. Very easy to drink with its nice coffee and chocolate flavours.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours an opaque dark color, pretty much motor oil black, but with a shade of brown. Nice mocha head rises quickly in a billowing creamy foam. It retains decently and leaves some lacing.  In the nose there are some characteristic imperial stout aromas such as roasted malts, cofee, cocoa and burnt dark caramel. There are also hints of dark fruit and cherry. Being that there is such a high ABV, the presence of bourbon is unsurprising, neither understated, nor boozy.  In the mouth it is rich, robust and full of complexity. The creamy and smooth mouthfeel brings about a fudge like and caramel sweetness. Yet there is so much more. There are alcohol soaked dark fruit, blackberry and cherries that add a note of tartness. As I drink on, the sweetness gives way to an increasingly roasty, bitter espresso roast, and charred malt that lingers. The finish also becomes increasingly dry and bitter. A mixture of bourbon sweetness and spice adds yet another element. The alcohol warms but doesn't overwhelm.  Big bodied and vinuous, definitely a sipper, yet easy to drink at the same time. Delightful and decadent. A real treat!

This time in a can dated 31Jan2017. Didn't right a review that time so here goes.    Pours like motor oil. Black and opaque with a small amount of head. The aromas are caramel, boozy and faint chocolate. Roasted malts, caramel and sweetness with alcohol warmth on the finish. Feels creamy and viscous over the tongue. Overall a great beer. Not tasting a lot of the coffee. Perhaps the coffee notes fade with age? (This review is 21Jan2018.) Really enjoying how the flavours linger on the palate long after each sip. Beautiful sipper to share and discuss with friends.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I picked up a bottle of this to share with a buddy of mine who, like me, is a huge dark beer fan. I've been wanting to try this one for a while now and finally got the chance to do so.    This beer pours a pitch black, opaque hue which results in not being to make note of the carbonation level present. he head is a khaki color and creamy in appearance, dissipating to a thin lacing with a neck that is retained. 4.25/5 The aroma is exactly what I expected with dark chocolate, vanilla, dark roasted malt, a touch of coffee, and a dark fruity sweetness all coming out in concert together. The aroma is heavily balanced toward the malt with no noticeable ho profile. There is a touch of booziness on the nose, but it is not overwhelming by any means, and it really goes to show just how strong this aroma is. 4.25/5 The flavor is every bit as awesome as the aroma with toffee and dark chocolate leading the way, transitioning into a dark roasted malt with a touch of espresso as well as vanilla. A bit of earthy grain, hay, tobacco, and hay notes come out in the middle but a dark fruitiness quickly envelopes them. There is light bitterness on the back end as well as a bit of booziness, but nothing overwhelming and neither linger after swallowing. 4.5/5 This is a very full bodied beer and a very heavy one at that with a light carbonation tickle on the front end that quickly subsides to a full mouth coating and creamy mouthfeel that really wets everything down nicely. There is really no dryness to speak of and no lingering dryness. 4.25/5 This is really an awesome imperial stout that brings out its flavors wonderfully well. Needless to say, my buddy and I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and will be returning to buy another one in the near future. 4.25/5   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 This is probably still my favorite beer. Bottled on 5/12/2014 and poured into a snifter.    The appearance is pitch black with a super compact 1 finger mocha head that lasted well. Alcohol legs on the glass as well.    The aroma is huge with chocolate, vanilla, dark fruit, a bready malt sweetness and roasted malts. Some alcohol spice creeps up as well.    The taste follows the nose with chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits, and a big bready malt sweetness. Also a slightly subdued roast comes through afterwards.    The palate is full with a viscous creamy finish that lingers rediculously long. So substantial. Has just enough heat that lingers slightly.    This is such an amazing beer that has held up wonderfully. I am happy that I have a couple more aging. Hopefully I can try the barrel aged version eventually.

S: Can start to smell this from a couple feet away. Bittersweet chocolate, medium roast coffee with cream, sweet tobacco, leather, molasses, and a hint of dark honey.  T: Wow! Chocolatey goodness combined with medium-dark roast coffee. Perfect harmony between those two notes. Caramel, cream, sweet tobacco, molasses, dark honey, and a hint of leather.  M: Medium-heavy body (drinking a tad lighter than ABV). Super smooth and creamy feel. Darkly sweet with mild bitterness throughout. Mildly sticky. Lingers and matures nicely on the palate too.  D: Was expecting an outstanding brew...and definitely got it. The chocolate and coffee interplay in this beer is phenomenal.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 750ml bottle from 2014, bought from Brewdog.com (£15.25):  Great stuff from AleSmith again here & a beer that was every bit as good as I'd hope for going in; it was definitely worth the wait in cracking this bottle open. The beer was kicked off by a lot of darker, roasted malts & coffee flavours but it was also a touch sweeter than expected thanks to the sugars & chocolate, but also the darker fruits & vanilla that featured too. The beer was quite rich & complex with good carbonation & only a little of the 12% abv. showing nearer the end of the nose & taste, something that helped the beer down very easily. The beer was very much a moreish offering with some dry touches nearer the end & some subtle darker fruits coming through to keep things interesting at times.; I really enjoyed drinking this one & it seemed to go down slightly better than the Vietnamese Coffee edition that I tried on-tap last year; an excellent beer that you definitely need to try, it's one that I'll be on the hunt for again now.

Leaves a lot of lacing as well. Perfect.    S: Slight scents of charred coffee bean and chocolate give way to a concoction of sweet plum, figs, and raisin. Very complex and sweet. Very little in the way of hops.    T: Follows the nose. Hints of chocolate followed by robust dark fruit. Back of the pallet is pure fruit; there's a lingering taste of licorice, raisin, and plum. Tastes like a Russian Imperial Stout - very similar to Old Raspy.    F: Good.    O: A nice stout. A little overrated, but it's worth the purchase price.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 From the black foil wrapped 750 ml. bottle. Sampled on December 24, 2016.    It pours a dark brown color with a modest, short lasting tan frothy head.    All kinds of aromas including dark sweet malts, coffee grinds, rich malts, fig, plum, char, but a low hop profile. Booze is buried.    Full body and smooth.     This is the kind of stout flavor that other brewers try to emulate. Bold and rich dark malt, dark bread sweetness, dark fruits, vague coffee, wood, slightly smoked, and a mild but easy to handle earthy hop finish. Through and through you would never know this is 12% ABV because the booze is integrated beautifully into this beer. Although my head will feel it later.     I usually have to think carefully about spending $15 on a single bottle of beer but this is worth that.

I've had fresh bottles from multiple batches that were a bit unbalanced, with too much dark-roasted bitterness, but after some time in the bottle, it really smooths out. The coffee is still prominent at that point, but it brings out more earthy nuttiness and subtle dark chocolate notes to balance the bitterness.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 $9.99 for a 22oz bottle. No ingredients listed per the website. Brewed with ryan brothers coffee. 12% ABV, 70 IBU, OG=1.114    Pours out to an inky black, forming a tall dark tan head with excellent retention and solid sheets of lacing. Carbonation is moderate. Lots of prune juice, soy sauce and black walnut in the nose, with some dark chocolate and mild roast. Mouthfeel is rich, oily and dense with a big body. The taste is a recap of the nose. Prune juice, soy sauce, black walnut, then chocolate, and moderate roast, some vanilla and a little leather in the finish. Earthy moderate bitterness, roast lasting in the finish and a black pepper heat of alcohol. Quite boozy, more than I would anticipate for 12%.    A nice imperial stout, although its a bit hot and boozy for me, with some mild fusels and finishing very dry. I'm not inclined to buy it again.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Black with a nice tan foamy head that really laced the glass. I get aromas of chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, and a hint of alcohol. When you drink it you can defiantly taste the alcohol, there is a nice sweetness of chocolate and dark fruits that is followed with the long bitterness of coffee, roasted malts, and hops. The dryness is not overwhelming and the beer is smooth and mouth coating.

At 12% there is a heavy presence of booze on the nose, obviously along with coffee. The taste doesn't nearly have the alcohol taste as it did on the nose. Dark chocolate and a big presence of coffee dominate the taste without taking away from having the malt and original stout flavor. Overall this is very well balanced and one of the best if not the best coffee beers I've had.

Mouthfeel is smooth, not quite as complex as an aged BCBS but very nice.    A very good stout to find if you haven't tried one.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 From a bomber (about a year old) into a Yeti snifter. Pours a deep black with edges of beautiful dark walnut and a thin crown of khaki head that leaves fairly good lacing. Nose has nice layers: toasted and roasted nutty malts, chocolate malts, an edge of bitter roasted coffee/espresso bean, and a little licorice...not a huge nose, but lots to enjoy. Taste brings everything in the nose home, and ups the game...really delicious. I'm also getting a little more dark fruit in there...maybe some dates or figs. There's a lot going on here, and I find that each sip can bring out a different dimension of the profile...I don't find that one feature dominates as ever-present/prior. The power of the alcohol come through for sure, but it isn't really hot. Mouthful is full and creamy and smooth, though for the abv, I wouldn't say it is super heavy. Really great stuff. It has been awhile since I've had a great imp stout, so hard to know how it compares with others, but...this definitely belongs in the conversation.     (With this profile and approach, I can guess how the Vietnamese coffee version might make a lot of really great sense...note to self.)

Can't see any carbonation, and can't see through it.    Smells of coffee, chocolate, black liquorice, toasted notes, and sweet like tiramisu.    Chocolate, coffee, hints of black liquorice, quite sweet, quite boozy. Sort of freezer like quality that Peche Mortal has. Very similar to Peche Mortal. Sweet with a green bean like quality.    Thick and slightly oily, it has a little, foamy carbonation.    I got this one at Mikkeller Bar, Bangkok tonight. I'm having it at Green View Hotel in Ekkamai 10, Sept 12, 2016.

I'm so burned out on coffee stouts I was hesitant about this one... but the coffee flavor is mild and delicious in the background. It's so smooth and clean-finishing. I'm going to stock up more bottles in the cellar.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 The definition of a strong coffee imp stout, runs 11 or 12 bucks for a 750ml bottle in my area which is a bargain. Surprisingly mild alcohol taste for 12% abv, strong espresso and roasted malt flavor, pitch black beer and a short, thick tan head. Smells like a dark Guatemalan coffee. Substantial body and mild carbonation, basically you're gonna have a great time if you're remotely into standards like Old Rasputin, Stone russian imp, Narwhal etc. If I was giving this an objective everyman rating it'd probably be straight fives, but personally I dig flavored desserty sweet stouts more than classic imp stouts. I left half in the fridge overnight, the next day the taste had barely diminished at all. A top notch stout.

Recommended.

The beer was jet black and viscous on the pour with a tall and thick khaki head that kept me company, finally settling into a firm cap. I detected dark cherries, raisins, and plums on the first whiff, immediately followed by roasted coffee, dark bread, and cocoa. I tasted the coffee first and it stayed with me the entire way, allowing the other flavors to come up nicely: cocoa, raisin, toffee, dark bread, etc. Definitely a coffee-forward presence but well-balanced. Full-bodied and thick and creamy on the palate, but not overly sweet. A gentle warming on the finish to remind you of the ABV.

Smells of coffee and dark chocolate with molasses creeping around in the background. Taste is just awesome, full on coffee blasts you up front with a rounded dark chocolate mix and a very nice malty hops on back side. Finish is very smooth and creamy with very little burn from the high ABV. This is a great beer especially with a great cigar, outstanding....

Lacing is present and retention is great.    Smell: Rich chocolate, roasted malts, bitter coffee, and hints of some dark fruit but not as much as a RIS.    Taste: Chocolate, roasted malts, hints of dark fruit, small notes of coffee, surprisingly very smooth for a 12% ABV. Only minor technicality is I wish there was more coffee coming through but not enough to take away from my score.    Feel: Very creamy, rich, and thick! Surprisingly no alcohol burn for this clocking in at 12%.    Overall: This is one amazing imperial stout! This beer is soo smooth for coming in at 12%. I hope that some of the other versions of this beer make its way to the Pittsburgh PA market once AleSmith gets a foothold here as they are still relatively new to this market. I will be seeking out another bomber of this and I highly recommend purchasing this brew if you haven't tried it yet!

The head resembles coffee gelato. It smells of roasted malt, dark chocolate, burnt coffee, and a strong aroma of alcohol. The taste is true to the nose with a lot of burnt coffee grounds and baker's chocolate. The alcohol burn is also quite noticeable. There is also a slight hint of vanilla in the aftertaste. It also finishes with a dry bitterness. About the only thing missing is dark fruit. This stout is medium-bodied, lightly carbonated, and it packs a wallop with an ABV of 12%. It's not as viscous as some of the other Imperial Stouts of similar reputation but it will stand up to a fine meal. Overall, this is a world class Imperial Stout. Whether it is better or worse than KBS, BCBS or some of the others is merely a matter of personal taste. This stout is spectacular!   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 L. Black and opaque but not "motor oil" thick on the pour. 1 cm head reduces to a thin layer which stays and leaves a healthy lacing.    S. Roasted malt, chocolate malt, rich dark chocolate, very subtle dark fruit, rich mocha.    T. Bitter cocoa, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, cappuccino, chocolate malt, graham crackers, vanilla, a little bit of booziness. Caramel and chocolate aftertaste. The coffee flavor doesn't stand out, but compliments the other flavors so well.    F. Rich and creamy without being thick and heavy. Pretty well carbonated.    O. A masterpiece. My first 5/5. Cheers!

Smell is charcoal, molasses, prunes, and cinnamon. A little warming up also brings some raisins. When I imagine what a dark beer should smell like, this is it. It's more sweet than bitter, but nothing is overbearing.    The taste is complex for a dark stout, so I need a couple of sips to sort it all out. The charcoal is always covering everything, but there is a lot of dark dried fruit. The raisins match the prunes, and there's also a little bit of blackcurrant and huckleberry. It's not quite as dynamic (feeling of a big depth and range of flavors) as some of the things that I give higher taste grades to, but it is excellent for the type. (Then there's the charcoal issue holding things back.) There's a honey-ish sweetness that shows up to complement the molasses. A little chicory, too.     The feel is so solid. There's a bit of carbonation, but it's like something that I could chow down on.

As this warms it stays pretty consistent and the coffee gets stronger with a slight caramel feel.  The feel is a medium feel that is creamy.  Overall, this is a good RIS(coffee) stout. It is smooth and the alcohol hides fairly well.

Poured into a River City snifter, this was the color of deep space, with a good sized tan head that took it’s time dropping and left lots of lace on the sides of the glass.    Rich, coffeeish and dark chocolate aromas of dark, roasted malts.    The taste was perfectly balanced between bitter and sweet, with neither gaining the upper hand over the other. Very black coffee forward flavor at first, but backed up by a dark chocolate-like sweetness that mitigates the bitter, coffee bite. The high alcohol is fairly well masked, but there is a little bit of a boozy warmth loitering in the background. There’s a slightly dry, hoppy zap to the palate at the swallow.    Full bodied, with a creamy and velvety-smooth mouthfeel.    This is a big beer with big flavor. It doesn’t taste quite like a true RIS (no dark fruit flavors), and tastes more coffeeish than some coffee stouts I’ve had, but it’s absolutely delicious, not to mention dangerously drinkable for a 12% alcohol beer. Yep, this is deserving of it’s hype.

Nose is predominantly roasted malts. I'm getting caramel, vanilla, and a little booziness.    The taste is ridiculous. Heaps of coffee and roastiness. Still getting that caramel to complement the stronger flavors here. This bottle is also 6 months old so I'm sure the coffee has faded a bit but it's still strong.    Mouthfeel is superb. Full and thick yet smooth and slick. No alcohol burn and very minimal alcohol taste if any.     This is almost my favorite beer now. Definitely top 5 for me. I think if I could can get my hands on a BA version of this it would be my number one.

Some fine-looking lacing after the head fades. Astringent, fresh ground coffee hits the nostrils first. Mocha-tinged caramelized sugars follows, suggesting this could be somewhat sweet. Faint notes of vanilla, along with just a hint of alcohol.    Speedway tastes at least as good as it smells. Balance between bitter and sweet is just about perfect, as far as I'm concerned. Very coffee forward, but it doesn't utterly dominate the flavor profile. Beyond the coffee notes, bittersweet dark chocolate with hints of caramel are present. The 12% ABV is well-hidden, with only traces of fusel alcohol. In short, an absolute top-notch imperial stout with coffee. Now I can't wait to try one of the barrel-aged versions.

Pours near black, really opaque, with a one finger head and lots of foamy cling. Smell brings lots of roasted malts and coffee. some chocolate and vanilla. Great aroma. Taste also leads with the malt- not as roasty as the nose, strong coffee, more chocolate than the nose, vanilla, a little molasses. Very smooth for the ABV, creamy, full bodied, well carbonated, a real tongue coater.    This is a real favorite, and it's even more of a treat on tap. So well blended and bursting with flavor and aroma. This is one everyone should try, if you have the chance.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Had this on tap. Solid black body with a cream colored head, periodic swirls of the glass renew a layer of foam on top of the beer. Good amounts of foamy lacing. Smell is huge: some alcohol, dark coffee, and rich dark fruits. Taste is similarly huge, with dark chocolate and coffee at the forefront. Slight amount of burned/charred bitterness with a boozy bite. Other notable flavors are detectable on the finish: raisins, plums, tobacco, leather. Long lingering charred and roasted flavors on the aftertaste. Booziness is apparent but not as strong or unpleasant as I expected, overall the feel is still relatively creamy and full. A very nice stout!   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottled 02/18/15. My first Speedway, so not sure if it is the aging, but I am getting as much dark fruit (raisin) as coffee in both nose and taste. Incredible dark black pour with nice tan head. Nose is dark chocolate, molasses, raisin. Taste is the same, but as big and bold as advertised, complex. If I had this blind, I might have thought it was a Quad or Alt beer. Very smooth mouth feel. So much going on here, that the 12ABV is pretty well hidden in layers of flavor. Definitely world class.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 AleSmith Speedway Stout | AleSmith Brewing Company. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this beer's head is three fingers thick and tan, with solid lacing and a body none more black. Its like the album cover for "Smell the Glove".    I smell a generous helping of the coffee mentioned on the labeling, along with caramelized malts and a mildly noticeable boozy-ness.    Tastes like the three components of the aroma, with the addition of dark fruits, dark chocolate, toffee, and tobacco. Quite the "big" taste alright.     The mouthfeel I'm picking up here is heavier with very little carbonation. Its deceivingly smooth with no alcohol bite or immediate warmth.    Overall, I'll rate AleSmith Speedway Stout | AleSmith Brewing Company with a very solid 4.75. I can definitely understand why this keeps getting praises as one of the best U.S. made stouts around.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Very pretty stout on the pour; thick, opaque black, with nice carbonation, a fluffy finger-width head that leaves a ring of tan foam and some spotty lace.     Smells very roasty and malty, with the coffee being a bit subtle, along with some molasses, vanilla, chocolate and booze. Taste is very heavy on roasted malt, grains and molasses. Rich and lush chocolate presence coalesces with the light coffee roast, vanilla, toffee. Both of these attributes didn't quite hit the mark for me as in my opinion they were a bit subdued.     Mouthfeel is thick, rich, velvety and creamy. Only a light note of bitterness from the coffee and cacao. No alcohol presence. This is where this one shines for me.     Was expecting more, but overall this is still an amazing brew from a brewery that never disappoints.

This stuff is fantastic.

S: Dark chocolate, anise, molasses, some light coffee in the distance.    T: OMG! Roasty, toasty dark chocolate intermingled with anise, molasses and leather. I get a pop of coffee on the finish that's smooth with low bitterness. Even a hit of vanilla Then the 12% slides in for the kill. Smile and sip again.    M: Medium to high with medium, thick carbonation.    O: A superior stout that overwhelms the taste buds in the best way possible. Sexy, sultry, smooth and decadent. It only improves with some warmth.

Poured a jet black with a nice tan head  Smells of roasted nuts, hints of coffee, chocolate and vanilla  I was kinda disappointed in the taste - I got mostly a ton of smoke with very little coffee and chocolate. A little bit of vanilla in the aftertaste.  I definitely want to give this beer another go, just because of that smoke flavor I got.

Some boozy warmth on the finish. The flavor begins with the robust coffee and ends with a complex warm and somewhat bitter finish.    F - Chewy with a crisp carbonation tingle on the tongue.

This is the third time I've had Speedway Stout and the much that has been made of it is well-deserved.    I'm not going to add to the accolades of Speedway Stout. It is wonderful. Rich, balanced and alcoholic. It is a simple, elegant stout... without lots of the vanilla (et cetera) flavors. I had some with two spoonfuls of caramel sauce and found its pair. (This inspired me to put caramel in my morning coffee.)    Listed on the "1001", Speedway Stout deserves to be recognized. The review makes much of how Alesmith is a home brewing operation grown up with lots of enthusiasm. They have stuck to their knitting (IPA and stouts and barleywines) and have grown slowly and well.

Smell: There are aromas of roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. There are hints of citrus aromas as well.    Taste: There are flavors of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and a very slight burnt character. There are hints of citrus was a strong bitterness with it. There is a strong presences of alcohol.    Feel: It has a full body with a slight creaminess. It has a moderately strong alcohol warmth. It has a moderately strong bitter dry finish.    Overall: This is a strong example of a stout with a superior taste and finish.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Finally gonna crack this after 6 months of waiting, aging, and letting my excitement grow from my last trip to Seattle.     Appearance : Coca-Cola brown from the bottle, forms into a dark chocolate to pitch colored body. Head is reddish-beige-almond, stays at a couple fingers and then gradually fades to a nice creamy ring.     Smell : Aromas of chocolate covered raisin, some walnuts, dark chocolate nibs, and a touch of day old coffee. It's a trail mix of sorts in character but pretty faint in volume.     Taste : Strong coffee-mocha punch right to the kisser. Lots of bittering hops swirling around, taking turns scraping your tongue of all dignity. A melted dark chocolate Hershey's kiss melts right in the middle of this swath. A destructive path of coffee and dark bath of acidity is left on your palate, utterly shredding it to pieces.     Feel : First thing I noticed, first thing that struck me, first thing I fell in love with here. Total mouth destruction. I love it. Creamy, blissful, full.     Overall : Um....this stout is like utterly amazing. I'm not much on coffee-based stouts, but this thing dominates in so many ways and presents so much depth and complexity in flavor that it's impossible to not fall in love with this. Total artistic brewery perfection. Can you improve on this? Possibly not.      Edit :     Another bottle, aged 1 year. Taste isn't as great, but the mouth is still there. Smells like licorice and roast malts, and tastes a bit more like burnt coffee and ash but the Imperial is there with a capital I. Awesome. Scores adjusted a little, but it's still one of my favorite grabs.

Look is dark mahogany, thick, with a fluffy tan head from a hard pour. film sticks around the top with a thin ring and spotty lacing.    Smell is strong roasty malts and notes of coffee.    Taste is coffee first, wonderful and not too bitter or acidic. Cocoa is next and very good, finally the roasty malts carry it home. Lots of layers here, complex without trying to do too much.    Feel is off the charts, thick and creamy, enough carbonation to make it lively on the tongue, and a long finish that brings out the bitterness. Excellent feel, don't even want to swallow except to get another drink!    Overall, this is one of the best stouts of any variety I've had. Everything is rich, without being too over the top or smacking you in the face. Drinks really smooth and there's no signs of the big abv.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Unbalanced as far as imperial stouts are concerned. The taste of alcohol is unmasked, I think the coffee could have been ramped up to help mute the alcohol. Lots of chocolate on the front, after which all I tasted was burn. The nose closely follows the taste. Pours dark with more head than you see with most imperial stouts.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 THE STANDARD when it comes to coffee stouts. Time to try it out for a rating.    750 mL bottle, undated, poured into Guinness stout glass    L: Pour brings big 3F+ soapy very light tan head with lots of retention, lacing, and a ring. Beer is midnight black.    S: Coffee up front, followed by roasted malts, with some vanilla, cocoa, cloves, and cinnamon in back.    T: Coffee and roasted malts forward, a hint of vanilla dairy creamer and a tiny bit of alcohol (no burn, a bit of drying). I expected slightly bolder, but it's very good.    F: Moderate to heavy bodied, light carbonation, alcohol content leads to a little bit of palate drying, but impressive cloaking of 12% ABV indeed.    O: A shade short of the true greats, but solid flavor and construction say this is a beer that has earned its status.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours black with a thick, foamy creme colored head. A bit of spotted lacing gets left behind as the beer disappears. Really, it looks close to perfect. The aroma is highlighted by coffee, which is incredible. Toasted and roasted malts sit behind. Great aroma. The taste features a blast of coffee, with toasted malts, and chocolate in the background. Absolutely stellar. Mouth feel is sublime, with it's thick, robust feeling, while still remaining smooth and easy to gulp down (it's almost tough to not gulp it). Overall, a beer that delivers on every front. I traded for it after reading about it in coffee beer reviews. So glad I did. I was disappointed to see the bottle was from early 2015 (consumed/reviewed on April 1st, 2016 - but this beer is no joke) as I thought the coffee notes would've faded away, but I was dead wrong. They are there and in force. It's an absolute delight to drink.    Served in a 12oz snifter. Bias: I love coffee.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A - A black body, inky opaque, with a thin, light tan head that fades to a cast across the top and a ring at the edge. Minimal lacing, small dots scattered on the side of the glass.    S - Smashing hit of warm alcohol. It hides most else, but molasses, coffee and chocolate notes are behind.    T - The front is dark chocolate and molasses, a touch of coffee bitterness, and a bright malty middle, coming to a more acidic and alcohol note in the close.    M - Warm and slick, a touch sticky, but with enough burn on the close to clear the palate of the beer's definite weight.    O - A mighty fine stout, with lots of depth, and great feel. The nose is a bit too much alcohol, but fortunately the flavor is dialed in. I think I'll need to get this one again.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured aggressively at 53°F from a 750no bottle (no date) into a beer goblet. Consumed on 13Mar16.   LOOK: A fingers worth of cinnamon colored foam foams after being poured. The foam head changes color to khaki within 15 seconds. At 1 minute and 45 seconds, the foam head has halved itself in size, leaving behind a moderate amount of thick lacing from the dissipation. Black in color with an orange tint. Rising bubbles are small in size and very subtle in quantity. Lacing is thick and moderate.   SMELL: Strong molasses, sweet chocolate, and sweet coffee aromas entangle with mild aromas plum, sweet black cherry, alcohol, vanilla, and bitter roasted malts.  TASTE: Very strong molasses and sweet chocolate flavors first bombard the palate. This initial explosion of sweetness is welcoming yet leaves me yearning for balance. Some balance is brought as strong alcohol and mild vanilla, plum, and sweet black cherry flavors immediately follow. More balance is achieved as mild flavors of sweet coffee and subtle flavors of bitter roasted malts close out the final taste.  FEEL: Very full-bodied with subtle amounts of carbonation. Goes down incredibly smooth and creamy. Finishes with a strong dryness. A great and nearly unwelcoming alcoholic warmth can be felt as it goes down the throat.  NOTE: The alcohol flavors are personally off putting for me, but as I stated, they do bring some balance to the sweetness. This Stout is definitely not for those who love their alcohol hidden.

No burning, just creamy smooth goodness going down. You get the coffee as the aftertaste, but it is subtle. Well done.

Creamy mouthfeel, full bodied with a dry finish. Wonderful.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 L: Pours pitch black with a decently-sized khaki head for the style that retains itself in large bubbles around the edges of the glass.    S: Semi-sweet with musty coffee, caramel, bready malt and some dry cacao. A nice roasted character that breaks through the malt and maintains a good balance.    T: Very balanced but certainly on the sweet side, particularly in the finish. Lots of caramel and toffee, with fairly restrained coffee flavor for a coffee stout. Thick and rich, with just enough coffee and hops keeping the rest from getting out of hand. Sweet, syrupy finish with plenty of roasty coffee and a decent amount of booze.    F: Medium-plus body – surprisingly light for this beer’s strength – with light-to-medium carbonation and a substantial amount of lingering warmth in the finish.    Thoughts: A classic for a reason. At 12% abv and with it’s sweetness it’s not the most drinkable beer I’ve come across, but it’s a very well crafted imperial stout. The relatively light body adds some drinkability, and the coffee definitely adds some balance and complexity.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Bottled 4/24/14    Pours nearly opaque black with a little amber/ruby red highlight when held up to light. Head is ample 1 1/2 finger light tan color. Looks like an espresso. Head receeds to a nearly full film on top with tight bubbled collar. Collar widens as the top film dissipates.    Nose is heavy chocolate and coffee and signifies there's a lot of depth. Ever so slight licorice scent but reminds me of the chocolate licorice more so than black licorice. Some alcohol/ booze in far background.    Initial taste is medium roast coffee with a fairly prominent vanilla component to compliment it. A slight twang of roast and bitterness on the back of the tongue. Opens up to some bitter-sweet bakers chocolate but when cold, the bitterness overtakes the sweetness. 12% is nowhere to be found. Bitterness from the roasted malts later excuses itself somewhat to some chocolately and caramel sweetness as it warms.    Medium to full bodied and silky feel complimented by low carbonation. Lingering bitterness on back of palate. Has a milky texture.    I've been holding on to this bottle for a while and figured I'd give it a crack today for NBS. Did not disappoint one bit. Full bodied feel offers a range of all the flavors you'd expect in a coffee stout. ABV is invisible and not sure if it's because of the age or just the artistry in how this one was crafted. Nonetheless, I need more of this.

I'm not a connoisseur, yet, but I'm becoming a Stout and Porter guy so my opinion is becoming well rounded for this genre.  Speedway ranks as my absolute favorite Stout thus far. It's a palette's super nova providing complex aromas with thick malty goodness. The flavor lingers on the palette and as it tapers, you'll taste hints of cocoa and light caramel/molasses. Bury your nose in the glass and take a deep breath to prime your senses with each sip of this beer... but most crucial of all... drink this beer slow to really appreciate it like a good medication from the ol' doc.

Smells of cocoa, smoked malts, oatmeal, and brown sugar.     Flavor of cocoa, oak, coffee bean, toasted bread, caramel, brown sugar, and a whisper of licorice.     Full body with a sting from both the carbonation and alcohol. Warms going down.    Top notch stout with loads of flavor and aroma that mesh beautifully. I've almost tried this several times and am glad I finally did. Up there near the top of my stout list all-time. Maybe one or two others I'd pick before this. Must-try.

A: Coffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate, picking up some alcohol, big aromas, was expecting more coffee.    T: Touch of coffee up front, adding some moderate bitterness, roasted malts, dark chocolate, big dry finish, incredibly smooth and drinkable, for 12% ABV the alcohol is well hidden.    M: Balanced carbonation, dry finish, full bodied, creamy smooth mouthfeel.     O: This is a very tasty beer I can't believe I waited so long to try it, amazingly drinkable, smooth, creamy mouthfeel, very balanced, roasted malts and dark chocolate with a touch of coffee, a world class beer. I would like to see this in a different format besides the bomber bottle.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Poured off tap into a snifter at My Place in Newtown, CT     Appearance - Pours a beautiful jet black with half inch tan head. Head retention is light due to the alcohol but it looks pretty as ever    Smell: Dark roasted malts and coffee take over the aroma - a small tinge of fruit and molasses here as well, you can really smell the malt flavors through a quick sniff, smells premium for sure    Taste: Dark chocolate and coffee flavor is predominant - a nice tinge of esters from the alcohol but not enough to make your face cringe, it's way on the backside. Finishes with a smokey flavor that is very appealing    Mouthfeel: This is where his beer shines. Not overly slick, still a bit light for the alcohol content and heavy enough to let you know your drinking a big stout. Carbonation is minimal as it should be.    Overall: I've heard so much about this beer since I got into craft beer back in 2007 and glad I finally got to try it. It's the picture perfect stout, light on the mouth and easy to drink yet complex and packed with flavor profile. Will seek again for sure!

I have never had the opportunity to try any of the variants but the original is a one of a kind beer.

Big coffee at first with roasted malts and dark chocolate making for bitter start. The bitterness is balanced by a softer finish which has vanilla and milk chocolate show up. Verges on being to bitter at times, but it mostly manages to remained balanced especially as it warms. Very good for the style.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 From a 22 oz bomber into a snifter, pours black with a finger of dense tan head whose top is dotted by frothy, larger bubbles. Head dissipates but never leaves completely. Lacing is moderate but lasting. Holding this beer to the light reveals a deep, rich ruby-brown along the edges--the middle is still impenetrable. Beautiful stuff.     Smells are initially dark fruits--raisins and black cherries--with coffee and chocolate mixing in. After warming a bit, roasty malts and caramel toffee appear as well.     Taste is roasty, dark fruit with evolving layers of complexity. Sweetness is balanced well by the bitter roasty flavors. Feel is dang near perfect. Rich and full without being overly viscous. The carbonation comes in just when you want to liven things up.     This is an outstanding Imperial Stout, worthy of its world-class rating.
