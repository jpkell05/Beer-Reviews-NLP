look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 This is definitely a good beginner IPA. It indicates what your personal taste wants from an IPA. More fruit or citrus flavor or more malt to balnce out the the hops.   Beer looks good as it has lots of little carbonation bubbles. Head dissapates after short time. Smell was unexpectedly not potent with some citris and pine. Taste follows suit with slight initial sweetness quickly followed by moderate pine bitterness. Very dry.  I need something in one direction or the other. Probably not fair to compare to Sculpin /Fresh Squeezed or Union Jack/Two Hearted. Standard IPA.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Poured from a single-serve into a pub glass.    Pours a classic amber-gold with a fine two-finger head and good lacing. Just a hint of haze.     The aromas are subdued, but excellent. Grapefruit citrus and oily pine resin hops in equal measures meld with just a hint of crackery malt--not sweetness, but just enough maltiness to balance.    The flavor is skewed hoppy, but not overwhelmingly so. Floral hops hit the beginning of the sip, with citrus (grapefruit flesh and pith) rounding out the middle palate, and oily pine hops and a touch of booze at the finish. The malts present on the nose are, again, just barely noticeable here.    The mouthfeel is excellent. Medium-bodied with a fine crisp finish.    I don't remember the last time I had one of these, but it would good to revisit an old-timer. There are certainly better and more creative offerings of the style now, but this is a solid rock.

look: 4.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 It has been so long since I have had this beer. One of the first IPAs I have ever had if I correctly recall.   L: Pours dark straw yellow in color. Nearly perfectly transparent, as is the case with most of these OG WCIPAs. From a simple pour, a frothy 3 finger of head was formed that settled down to what amounts to about a fingers worth of the same, densely packed head. Heaps of lacing on the glass, a true pleasant site. It coats the glass and makes me ever more so enthused.   S: Malt-forward, with healthy amounts of citrus and dankness. A smell that instantly harkens you back to the days of the OG WCIPAs. Dank and citrusy with a malt backbone.   T: Very hoppy and bitter up front, the you get the cascade of sweetness from the malts on the finish. Citrus flavor is present throughout, primarily consisting of lemon and grapefruit. Aftertaste is pine with dank resinous flavor and finally sweet malt at the finish. Sweeter than I remember, maybe due to bottle age.   F: Light in body, more medium in weight. Carbonation is moderate for the style. Smooth and easy to drink.   O: It still holds up well and is fun to revisit classics like this. Very drinkable at 6.9abv. Like I said, it is sweeter than I remember, but still tastes great on this rainy day. I am very glad to have re-tried. Cheers!

Smooth as silk classic WestCoast style regular IPA with fruity floral flavors, some pine, and a nice grapefruit bite. Delicious, and love the 19.2 oz cans at an reasonable price.

Maybe other IPAs I've had are just imitations of this really popular (and rightfully so) beer, or I'm just too late to the IPA game to appreciate this classic before its influence was spread. Either way, very hop forward, fruity, and piney with a really nice bitter backend. Definitely a worthwhile buy, but not something I think I'll come back to often.

This may be brewed in Richmond but it's basically the perfect West Coast IPA - a nice hoppy, piney, citrusy bite well-balanced with a caramel malt backbone (with very little sweetness). This classic beats the pants off the vast majority of new-school IPAs (whether NE-style or not).

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 From notes 4/1/12: Pours a hazy burnt orange producing a 1.5 inch, long lasting beige head that leaves super lacing. Aroma is hop heaven with caramel malt and resinous tones. Taste is up front various hop flavor, bite and bitterness with subtle caramel malt and a dry finish. A solid IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a deep golden amber coloration with a large frothy head. Smells mainly of hoppy grapefruit and orange notes, with a hint of pine as well. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by hoppy grapefruit and orange rind notes, but with quite a resinous character, light caramel malt and strong pine as well. Finishes with a medium/strong bitterness and quite a bit of pine lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. This is the quintessential West Coast IPA with its resinous character and notes of grapefruit, pine and caramel malt. Probably the best value-for-money IPA in Germany, if you can find it fresh.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Date: Bottled on 10/06/18, consumed on 11/06/18.    Appearance: Gold in color with much carbination and a finger of fluffy white head.    Aroma: Sweet caramel malts, grapefruit, and pine. This one has that pleasent nastalgic old school IPA smell. Also, some assorted citrus fruits, specifically orange, mingle in nicely.    Taste: Grapefruit and pine are larger on the taste than they were on the nose, and it has a massive bitterness which I absolutely adore. The malts are identifiable on the taste as well, but this and ode to bitter hops. Orange peel comes out as well. This beer, along with Delicious IPA and Tangerine Express, are why stone is my go to fridge filler brewery, outstanding!

Aroma is pine, dank, and resin hops with biscuit malts behind. Hops are biting, but not aggressive. Flavor profile is resin, dank, pine, and orange hops with biscuit and bread malts behind. It's clean, and while the hops bite a little, they are wonderfully balanced and blended into the beer. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a soft, velvety texture that lends itself to joyful sip after sip. Overall, a splendid, balanced IPA that hits traditional West Coast IPA hop notes. Classic, and for a good reason.    Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16.9oz can.

Overall I like it and recommend anyone interested in IPAs to try it.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 1.75 | feel: 2.25 | overall: 2.5 Pours a clear, clean pale golden color. Fluffy white head with tiny compact bubbles with a moderate head retention.  Aroma of oranges dominates with a hint of pine. Slight grainy malt smell.  Flavors of citrus (oranges) with very low malt sweetness.   Aggressive bitter hops.  Low carbonation on the palate, long bitter and very dry finish.   This is a beer with a narrow audience - those who love very bitter beers. It is on the high side of the bitterness scale and taste for an IPA. Otherwise, it is close to undrinkable for everyone else. So if you love highly bitter IPA's, go for it, this ones for you. If you prefer a more drinkable IPA or one on the lower side of the IBU scale, don't try Stone IPA. Go with a Harpoon IPA or a Sweetwater IPA Nothing against Stone Brewery, they are a great brewery.

Did this really kind of start the west coast IPA thing? And after all these years, is this really the first time I've tried this beer?? Who knows and who really cares. What is important is that this beer does deliver the sharp, poignant IPA bitterness that one would look for in an American IPA. I didn't find any freshness dating on the bottle, but it certainly delivers the goods. A fine beer; a classic beer.

Without a doubt it's an IPA they know how to make one that's for damn sure.

look: 3 | smell: 2 | taste: 1.25 | feel: 2 | overall: 1.5 Stone is having quality control, sanitation, and/or supply chain problems. The recent batches of IPA have been undrinkable. I lived in San Diego in the early 2000's - back in those days, the beers were a bit heavy-handed, but very well crafted.     I sent a note to the brewery after dumping 18 beers down the sink over a span of 3 months - no reply. This brewery has become too big for its britches, and quality is suffering. There are too many fantastic beers on the planet to bother with Stone.     To follow the terms of service:    Look: the IPA poured into glass with an appropriate amount of head and decent clarity... no complaints.   Smell: A bit off, see below   Taste: the flavor resembles a bucket of fermented mop water used to clean an institutional mess-hall. Notes of industrial solvent, mold, and cat urine.   Feel: well - I did not manage to swallow a single sip in the three six packs I purchased. Dish soap would be an accurate portrayal.

Taste is well balanced. I miss a great balanced IPA and this is one! Nice mild bready malt presence, crisp clean hop profile that mixes pine/earthy with crisp citrus seamlessly. Medium body with a nice sticky mouthfeel.

It’s a very good IPA that still shines as west coast ipa but times are changing and brewing is becoming a better science but this is still a good one. What I like most about it is that the taste hasn’t changed since the first time I had it.

Lacing is minimal with bits here and there around the glass.     The nose is tropical. You get lots of orange rind up front with just a touch of sweetness. The grains come through in the middle giving it some dryness. Finish is sweet and grainy with lingering bitterness.    Its quite balanced upfront between the bitter and the sweet. You get orange, pineapple, a bit a lemongrass and some grains. Ends sweet with a sharp lingering hops bitterness.    Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit oily. Its very soft with a nice amount of carbonation.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass.     L---Slightly hazy, rich golden color. Nice head that had decent retention and left excellent lacing.    S---Pine & citrus. Sweet.    T---Pine is definitely present, but without the bite I was expecting from the smell. Grapefruit is the most obvious taste, but there are also floral notes present.    F---Medium with excellent carbonation. Not as quenching as I was expecting.    O---This is an iconic IPA that I was trying for the first time, so I had high expectations, which might not be fair. All-in-all it was excellent and met those high expectations.

Citrus quenches with a puckering hit right up front--but not an overly strong one. On tap I feel like this grapefruit, citrusy taste tends to dominate, but out of the bottle the deeper pine notes and sweet bready malts are more noticeable on the back end. I prefer the former, though I wonder how much of that has to do with freshness (no date printed on this 6-pack).     Smooth, crisp, and slightly dry finish. A reliable classic.

Smell - Lemongrass and Squirt soda. Sweet and fruity with a slight acidic bite.    Taste - Grapefruit citrusy tones with an overwhelming bitterness. The hops completely block out any malt flavors. Somewhat single-note.    Feel - Medium thin body with moderate carbonation. Drinks smooth and easy.    Overall - A good example of a Plain Jane IPA. Nothing too special other than its history.

ITS AVERAGE.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Look - poured from a 12 oz bottle. Pale yellow in color, one finger head with lacing and decent carbonation.  Smell - floral, citrus, pine, heavy hoppiness. A myriad of flavors, though subtle, are detectable. Some malts in the background as well.  Taste - Strong, strong hoppy flavor with a malty backbone. A blend of floral and citrus hoppy flavor balanced out by a nice malt flavor in the finish. Clean and incredibly refreshing.  Feel - medium bodied, perhaps a bit more. medium high carbonation with a kick in booze as well at near 7%.  Overall - Stone IPA is one of archetypal examples of a west-coat style IPA. Catered to a smaller audience when the brew was first made, it is very hoppy compared to other similar beers on the market and some might find it a bit too overwhelming. However, to this day, it still is one of the best out there.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 IPA brewed by Stone Brewing, with an ABV of 6.90% This American IPA pours out a deep golden amber color with a nice white head. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness, and earthy grains and malts. This brew has the look and smell of most American IPA on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. The look and smell are really inviting. Now for the taste, it is Bold with hop bitterness at first. Then you pick up a smoothness of earthy grains and malts at the end. There is alot going on in Stone IPA. If you are not a fan of hops, this is not the brew for you. The body of Stone IPA, is a medium to heavy. But not to heavy. There is a super nice balance to this brew, there is nothing overpowering about this American. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Hoppy, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to Stone IPA a solid 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Stone Brewing, did a super nice job with American IPA.

Very well balanced, just a touch of biscuit malt flavor hiding behind the hops. Big bitter without being overdone. Great beer!

T: Crisp, citrusy and piney hop flavors, give way to moderate caramel malt sweetness, moderate hop bitterness with a dry finish.     M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.    O: Tasty; the beer has a great citrus and pine hop profile that's well balanced with caramel malts, making it easy to drink.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12oz bottled 11/30/17 RVA poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 6.9% ABV. The beer pours bright light straw orange yellow in color with abundant off white head. Retention and lacing are above average. The aroma is citrus and a hint of caramel malt. The taste caramel and citrus up front with a bit of pine. The finish is dry and pleasantly bitter. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied and adequately carbonated. There is a hoppy, slightly sticky bitterness that rests on the palate after the beer is swallowed. Overall, very good.

The taste is not nearly as balanced, no real citrus hit, just loads and loads of bitterness that lasts forever, the furthest thing from dry or clean. There are just WAY too many other amazing IPAs around here at the same abv and price point such as Duet, Breaking Bud, and Revision IPA to really come back to this.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 My favorite IPA. Look is a perfect hazy yellow gold. Head pours thin and decorates the glass with white lacing while drinking. Smell is a nice blend of citrus and pine. Taste is always wonderfully refreshing. Extra hoppy, not overly bitter and well balanced with a subtle malt charactor. The taste lingers and dissipates on the palate. Body is medium with ample carbonation. I keep coming back to this one.

(S) I’m getting piney/citrusy hops, a hint of grapefruit, and malt sweetness.     (T) Reaffirms the smell, but with a lighter malt backbone. Well balanced, with lingering bitterness.     (M) Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and finishes with enjoyable hop bitterness.     (D) Quite drinkable.    Although Stone now has quite a variety of IPAs to choose from, this one remains a prime example of a west coast-style IPA. This is an old favorite and it will definitely stay in my regular IPA rotation.

Smells like pineapple,fresh bread, citrus. Taste is crisp and refreshing with a taste of pine, pineapple,fresh baked bread. Feels smooth and nicely carbonated.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a clear glass. High carbonation, a perfect, elegant thick head, with a rich hazy orange glow.    Smells absolutely wonderful, very tropical. Piney, with citrus hints of tangerine, orange, and faint grapefruit. The taste invades and floods the mouth with its fruity goodness, sweet orange and grapefruit peel masking the tongue with bitterness but with no severe aftertaste.     Absolutely fantastic IPA.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 I enjoyed this American IPA brewed in Berlin but my experience of it was quite different from expected. There is a slightly funky smell, which I like, without citrus or fruit – somewhat redolent of the farmyard, one more likely to be found in a saison. The taste complements this to a degree, with some earthiness and a little bit of malt in the background. The hops come through more in the taste but not dramatically.

On the nose you get citrus as expected but also noyes of mango and pineapple.    Medium body, nice mouthfeel. Quite a subdued hop flavour, with quite a bitter finish. Not the flavour I was expecting and the subdued flavour means this is very sessional which could be quite dangerous at 6.9%vol, well for me anyway.    Good effort from Stone Berlin once more, will try more of their styles for sure.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This beer represents something special: Stone IPA, launched 20 years ago (I was still in high school at that time, I feel old now) it soon became the zeitgeist brew that grew immensely in stature on a certain website launched by two passionate beer-drinking brothers... you know the one I’m talking about - that site. So I’m going in to this review with a certain amount of reverence that will hopefully not become the folly of hype by the end of this page. However that’s hardly likely to happen with Stone “Xocoveza-Vertical-Epic-W00tstout-Americano” Brewing, those legends of San Diego (which of course in German means a whale's vagina) who don’t seem to brew any bad beers, least none that I’ve encountered [yet!]. Anyway: My beer awaits.    Poured from a 355ml can into a nonic pint.    A: Hazy amber body, like the sun rising between misty hills at golden hour. With an off-white thatch-work half centimetre head that leaves a nice sticky lace on the side of the glass. This is a damn-near perfect looking IPA, one that Pale Ales hope to look like when they grow up. 9/10.    S: Aroma is a dynamite piney/caramel combo with a hint of dried apricot and citrus leading me further down the rabbit hole. Top-notch fragrance, quintessentially West Coast... hell this is the original West Coast, so of course the aroma matches the ambition of this brew. It’s got a touch of hop fade... would love to have this fresh (can date: 17/02/17 - that’s over 5 months old now). 8/10.    T: Big citrus bite upfront, full piney/earthy notes, broad caramel base, dried apricot hint leading towards an assertive, almost aggressive, bitter finish. It’s balls to the walls this beer! Rather than be overly malty as other brews I’ve noticed with hop fade this one appears to have fared a little better - it’s only a lingering bitterness in the aftertaste that ruins an otherwise impeccable West Coast IPA. 8/10.    M: Feel is good, it’s got a bit of (Johnny) Dep(p)th to it, medium bodied, and an almost German-like carbonation (i.e. not quite but almost creamy). 9/10.    D: I get this beer. It started a “Generation X” wave of brewing beers that were bitter, tasty, and all round a bit of a handful (or glassful if we’re going to be technical here). However I now look back upon these early West Coast IPAs as the age of beers that were challenging, and at times too much for me, and I look forward to the ever growing popularity of New England IPAs which strike a perfect balance between sweet/bitter - which is my favourite beer balance. Huzzah! 9/10.    Food match: Go for some spicy buffalo wings with this brew.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottle to becher pint glass.  The appearance was a glossy burnt yellow to golden bronze color with a sly transparency about it. Moderate carbonation rapidly rises to hit a finger's worth of white foamy head that slid off at a moderate pace. Mild messy lace.  The aroma had a nice blend of spicy to earthy hops up front playing with a sly semi-sweet cracker malt backbone. Ample amount of pine to citrus peel particles slide in for a nourishing quality.  The flavor was a blend of the spicy earthiness to the pine and citrus bittersweetness, bold and up front and giving off the added persona of an eventful spicy earthy, piney and citrusy aftertaste.  The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt good and non-distracting to hop harshness. ABV felt as projected by the brewer.  Overall, if Greg Koch is reading this, I just want to say one thing to him - hey man, don't change to keep up with all of these newer flavors that feed into all of the people that just want to keep "ticking" new beers. The beer market might be changing, but still over 10,000 people that rated this on this site have the score equally out to above a 90 should tell you something and that something is this IPA will stand the test of time! It already has.

I'm done with it. They ruined (pun intended) Ruination with the "2" version, and my guess is that sales fell, so the brewery was a little more discreet with the labeling this time. Stone IPA 1.1 is now a routine IPA. Drinkable, certainly, but nothing special.

A beat-up Ford that keeps running. A pair of worn-in jeans, now & forevermore.  It goes. You chug it. It disappears. You need more.  It pours golden. It shines. It doesn't fuss around.  It starts with pine, & introduces honey, malt, & a drop of lemon.  You're in a house in the woods, or riding a motorcycle on a highway.  A maltiness gestures. A bitterness engulfs.  In its warmness a fruitiness appears:  That famous fruity touch that other breweries seek to emulate, but not to copy.  & in that fruitiness the happiness of drinking Stone IPA appears.

Towering frothy white head that leaves lashes of thick lace.    Smell: Fresh pine needles, citrus rind (lemon, grapefruit), garden herbs and slight earthy dankness.    Taste: Clean pale malt body dominated by big hop flavors: grapefruit, pine resin, savory herbs and bold but balanced bitterness. Hides its ABV well.    Mouthfeel: Medium body, slightly oily feel and moderate carbonation.    Overall: Prototypical West Coast IPA - solid male body with plenty of pine and citrus. Very drinkable.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 When the current IPA/IBU fad eventually subsides, and so many craft brews with it, Stone IPA will be one of those left standing. It has just the right balance that typify a really good IPA, which is why it has been around for 20 years this year.     Look- A beautiful crystal clear amber brew with a thin white head. There is virtually no residue on the glass after a sip. It is simply clean.    Smell- Pineapple and citrus provide a powerful punch that immediately begs to to take a sip. It is very appetizing.    Taste- The pineapple/citrus is carried over in full. There is, of course, the hoppy bitterness associated with a typical IPA. It is slightly sweet, too. This prevents the bitterness from being cloying. So many current Hop Bombs forget this balance. Hot food should never sacrifice flavor for the sake of heat. The analogy can apply to the bitterness of IPAs, too. Stone is NOT a Hop Bomb.     Mouthfeel- The body is medium-light. The swallow om is crisp and clean, but there is a strong tingle on the lips and tongue from the hops and good amount of carbonation. This is one of this beer's coolest features.    Overall- The value of Balance cannot be overstated. If I were to choose an adjective that summarizes why this is such a great brew, it would be "balanced". As a beer clerk who is frequently asked for recommendations by my customers, this is the IPA I point to when asked for a good example of the style.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 My second round with this classical Stone IPA, having had the pleasure of drink quite a few world famous ones from them in between so I knew I had to return to the roots again, to their trademark IPA and the Ruination.  It feels to me that they put so much Citra into this that it became bitter. Both dry hopping and otherwise the aroma of Citra is dominant but at the same time leaves quite a bitter aftertaste. Could there be something, a bittering hop hiding behind the citrusy overtones very subtly? Stone is a master brewery, I wouldn't be surprised if it was the case.  The beer tastes very smooth and the carbonation quite soft, makes you think for a minute that it is quite light in character but nothing could be futhet from the truth. It is a heavyweight champion, wolf in sheep's clothing if you like, a landmark IPA that everyone must try at least once and respect the greatness of hops and the genius of Stone who play with them as if they were an instrument...

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 2 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2 Look - Pours a dark golden color, frothy white head with patches of lacing everywhere.  Aroma - Mainly pine, fresh grapefruit rind, very resinous, sharp and pungent.  Taste - A one two punch of bitter pine and citrus, very soapy, big bitterness, aspirin. Malt seems like an afterthought and has a very plain cracker like taste. Aftertaste is hugely bitter with lingering pine and aspirin.  Feel - Medium bodied, highly carbonated, sharp, dry.    Overall - No real malt to speak of. Hop seltzer.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 On tap. Pours an amber color with a one finger head that recedes slowly and leaves lacing halfway down the glass. Nose of pine, grapefruit, and bitter hops. Taste of a pine, grapefruit, and hop oil that is bitter from front to back. Medium body and medium carbonation with medium-high bitterness that leaves an aftertaste.  It's definitely an aggressive, bitter, west coast IPA for hop heads. I prefer some of their other IPA's that are less bitter and more quaffable, but I've never been a hop head.

The nose is defined by fruity hops, oranges, lemon peel and cakey malts to highlight the hops. Classical nose for an ipa, a very enjoyable though.     Perfectly balanced, well carbonated bright and thirst quenching with a nice taste evolution regarding the evolving hop profile.    Bitter from the first glance, without pushing too far, due to balancing, sweeter malts. The hops are pretty fruity but foremost dry, bitter and in your face. Finishes soft, still dry but with a caramel malt sweetness cutting through.    Pretty wow, one the most well build west coast ipas I ve ever had. It is uncompromisingly bitter, while still caring for remaining drinkable, which is acoomplished by the noteable malts.

Nose  Grapefruit, papaya, lemon, navel orange, dough, honey, and caramel.    Taste  Grapefruit zest and white grapefruit juice. Pine needles, navel orange, and lemon slices. Hints of papaya. Firm caramel, doughy bread, and honey maltiness.    Mouthfeel  Medium-plus bodied, oily, crisp, off-dry, and moderately bitter.    Overall  I like the new iteration of Stone IPA. It adds more fruit juiciness while keeping some malt complexity.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 After walking past this beer for 3 years I finally decided to throw it into a mix a six and give it a try. I am not usually the biggest fan of IPA's, I'm more of a stout and porter guy, although I have been venturing more into the IPA world and starting to enjoy them.   L: Stone IPA looks great, it pours a nice dark gold color with a bit of an amber tint to it and a head that fades pretty quick. There is decent lacing as you drink the beer.  S: I could not get a whole lot of of the smell other than the hops maybe a little bit of citrus but that's about it.  T: Very hoppy at least for me. I do not think that I would have liked this beer if I would have tried it 2-3 months ago but I am really trying to get into IPA's and I'm finding that I am starting to like them more and this hoppy beast was a pretty good brew for the style.  F: I actually really liked the mouthfeel for this one. To me it was kind of thick for an IPA and I actually really liked it.  Overall: A solid IPA that i would gladly drink again not my favorite but one of the better beers I have had in the style.

Pine and resin bitterness take over the show from the start, only allowing quick glimpses of grapefruit and orange and finishing with an encore of lasting, spicy bitterness. Medium in body and most definitely potent. A stone cold (pardon the pun) classic and hophead's dream.

It's a clear medium gold color that looks good. It's definitely as nice as other IPAs and stands a bit above your everyday IPA.    The smell is good. It has a nice and strong grapefruit note to it that has a nice pine running through it. The malt notes also come out fairly well as a sweet note with a bit of bread to it.    The taste is very good. It has a nice strong bitter grapefruit note mixed with a nice pine running through it to give a good bitter bite. The malt note is sweet and light with a bit of bready note to it. While it does not quite balance out the It's simple compared to other IPAs but still very good.    The feel is good. It's a medium bodied beer with a nice dry finish and carbonated bite that makes this beer a pleasure to drink.    Overall, a pretty good everyday IPA and a very good IPA overall. It's hoppy but not overly bitter for the sake of being bitter.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a slightly reddish golden color. It's very biscuity, caramely on the malt front, with some nice grapefruit character from the hops. There's a reason that this is one of the standard examples of a West Coast IPA. It's as solid and reliable as they come.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Many bottles poured into 2/3 pint glass.     Having drank buckets of this stuff over the past few months it is time for a quick review. This has everything I look for in an everyday IPA. Huge nose and flavour combined with a near perfect body and mouthfeel make this the first beer I reach for after a long day at work. ABV is a little high to make this truly sessionable but a couple of these blow the cobwebs away of an evening. I keep trying to make a point of grabbing some of Stone's "GoTo" IPA to cut back a bit on the booze but I just can't see past this bad boy. Love it, and I'm very much a stout/porter kind of BA. Cheers!!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 A very strong balance in the aroma, taste, and flavors. Has a little bit of sweetness mixed with west coast hops and plenty of bitterness. Definitely an IPA where you cannot go wrong.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Canned on 11/28/16. Hazed amber with a finger and a half of frothy off-white head. Sweet aroma of caramel malt and tropical hops with papaya and pineapple notes. Similar tasting, with a mix of malt and tropical hops up front, a somewhat watery middle and moderate piney bitterness on the backend that lingers in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with strong carbonation. A nice, sweet IPA. Refreshing.

Taste adds some floral warmth from those centennial hops, but I find that the bitterness begins to come back with a little too much vengeance as it warms.     Light, slightly chewy body and peppery carbonation. All in all, could do much worse for a fridge mainstay.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Bought on Zombier.es and poured to a teku glass.    A: The body is pure crystalline with zero haziness, being yellow-y and orange-y. It has a wonderful colour. The head is one finger thick, leaves lots of lacing but has still better than average retention, however, for this beer, I was expecting it to have more retention.  S: The aroma is strangely sweet since I has hoping not to find anything sweet here. I guess there's some toffee in the back but I'm not sure of it. Yet, the aroma is very mild and you can't have any clues on the flavor coming from this.  T: The taste is really bittersweet, has it has some sweetness coming specifically from a characteristic I can't seem to find and then connecting it to the bitterness of the hops.  M: The body is medium to medium high. Carbonation is high. Bitterness is mild to strong.  O: I've had better IPAs from Stone but this is remarkably good for 96' recipe. Well done Greg!

Immediate citrus and bitterness coming through on the initial taste with lingering medium bitterness. It's towards the end of the taste that the malt comes into play with the lingering bitterness. It's fairly carbonated and not dry on the finish. I'm not loving this beer but it's not bad. A bit too out of balance on the bitter side.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Had on tap, first time in a long time. Have to say It was not as good as my memory of it. IPA's have come so far in the last few years that this was a disappointment. Pours a slightly cloudy orange color with a one inch, well retained head that left gorgeous lacing all the way down the glass. Smell is citrus, pine, sweet honey like note and some malts. Flavor follows the smell, but it smells better than it tastes. Slight astringent bitterness on the finish. Light bodied, moderately carbonated, slightly sticky mouth feel. Good, but certainly not great.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 OK, just different than the Northeast IPA I've grown to like from brewers such as Foundation (Epiphany) Other Half (Hop Showers) Trillium (pretty much any street beer) and last but probably best of all, Tree House (Julius) and pretty much whatever else they're canning. The Stone IPA isn't bad, it's OK and I guess a decent example of what it's trying to be but for me it just has a less full mouth feel some piney and has that bitter bite at the finish I don't really take pleasure in. Nice pour, orangy color somewhat cloudy, nice head that dissipates to nothing, but that bitterness at the finish coats my teeth and mouth and stays there long after I've swallowed.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 this is the new 1.1 Stone IPA, poured from a 12oz bottle (many times, 2 6-packs over the last three days) and I love it. Always liked the old version with its different hops but sadly I have passed this up too often over the last few years for newer brasher IPA's offered by other breweries. Can't wait to get a keg of this for the house. What is the difference in taste? Had a 12-pack of the older version but still within date code to compare and I have to say the newer one brings on a slightly sweeter malt before the hops take over. Not my favorite smell for an IPA, but every other mark puts it one of the better ones in my book. Still 6.9%abv, still 77 ibu. I like the hop balance better, it seems to me a bit more bitter on the finish.    The YT video on the new hops https://youtu.be/7SKtYzTn8Qo

O: Easy to drink despite the taste and mouthfeel being dominated by pine forest hops. It's intensely hoppy but somehow not heavy-handed. The 6.9% alcohol appears all of a sudden, however. So be careful!

Anyways, pours a darker yellow, dry hopped nicely, not huge these days, but back in the day it was one of the first bottled ones. Plenty of pine and grapefruit notes all over the nose and tongue. Malt bill might feel bigger by today's standard, this was right before the lighter drier malt bills took off in the full west coast vein.     Its got bitterness, but more going for it than just that, like I said, pine, its here.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 L: Clear, slightly hazy golden orange with a fluffy, off white head that leaves tons of sticky lacing.     S: Tons of pine needles, sap, and resin, juicy citrus, orange zest and oils that rip at your nose, and sweet biscuity malt character that comes across as orange marmalade on toast.    T: Delicate pine needles, biscuits and honey, grapefruit pith, orange juice, orange marmalade, with a bone dry finish and a lingering citrus bitterness that smacks of biting right into an orange peel.    F: Mouthfeel is medium, but feels full, slick, and almost creamy thanks to the hop oils and plentiful carbonation.    O: This still reigns supreme as one of the most reliable IPAs in the West Coast style. Dry, hoppy as hell, and incredibly drinkable with a firm punch of bitterness. Excellent.

S: Substantial nose, with the citrus and pine hops being most prevalent. A good, strong sniff gets your mouth watering for a taste.    T/F: Nicely complex flavor. The citrus and pine follow the nose, with some malt backbone to even things out. Just the right amount of bitterness, and a smooth finish. Full, but not heavy.    O: Very good IPA. Definitely one to keep in the rotation.

Toasted malt aroma with some piney n grapefruit hop notes. Taste starts with lightly toasted malt sweetness which is met immediately by big bitter hops. Pine and grapefruit peel dominate, some floral notes in there. While bitter overall, the flavor is not harsh. Medium crisp mouthfeel. Been awhile since I'd had this one and it's just as good as remembered.

Average visible carbonation and a thin white head.    S: Resinous pine, grapefruit and citrus pith. Cracker malts.    T: Resin, grapefruit pith, and a touch of spicy hops. Cracker malts that mostly stay out of the way. Finishes with some alpha-acid flavorless bitterness and grapefruit pith.    M: Light body, good carbonation sensation. The alcohol content is more noticeable than other IPAs at this percentage, but not overly hot.    O: I don't know how I've never reviewed this one. It's a throwback - tastes like an IPA from 5 years ago with an old school hop profile. Good, but don't expect to be blown away. But one that every craft beer drinker should try, right after Anchor Steam.

I had it fresh (about 2 weeks from DOB) and the hop profile was really nice, crisp and bright.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This might be approaching the status of an American classic, or at least maybe some sort of standard. Poured from a bottle with a drink-by date of 08/15/16, and kudos to Stone for printing BOTH bottled-on and drink-by dates on their bottles. Other brewers, please follow this example!    Golden dark straw beer with a generous, fairly thick, slightly off-white or yellowish head. Nice hoppy nose with resinous hops dominant, but some floral and citrusy notes as well. Taste, like nose, is balanced - a must with bitter beers, as far as I am concerned - and clearly there is some solid malt beneath the hops, even though this is a truly hoppy IPA. Head sticks with you, leaves lacing as you drink. Aftertaste bitter and a bit numbing as good IPAs often are.

It flies off the shelves, so it's always fresh. This is Key. I thought Southern Tier was interesting, but not fresh in my area. Dogfish 90 and 120 are insane. Even Victory DirtWolf is dangerous. All the DIPAs I've had are very dangerous, too good, too ABV. This staple IPA is where the legend started and still resides. It's close too all I'll drink. Your area, freshness may vary, where I envy you.

Maybe something sweet, like a faint lavender... perhaps honey-dew, but it doesn't work with the other flavors. Something kind of tastes like aftershave in here. No doubt appealing to certain people, but not this people.    Feels nice. Not much foam in the mouth. Simple bitter aftertaste that sticks around like that annoying cousin you wish would leave already but you invited him over so you can't kick him out without being rude so you have to just let stay here and annoy you some more. Gets more tolerable towards the bottom though. the sweetness is becoming more prevalent and the bitterness becomes less biting.    All things considered, this beer definitely takes a special palate to enjoy--a fine, and refined palate perhaps, but not my palate. The thing is, I can tell this is a higher quality beer, but it's taste is not for me. I will not seek this beer out again, except on a great rare ocassion maybe, but it is worth a try for anyone who enjoys IPA. Be warned, however, that is isn't your stock-standard party IPA.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This is the one for the European market, brewed in Germany. It's only 2 weeks old. Great fresh smell of hops, classic west coast with pine and citrus. Taste is maltier than most West Coast IPAs, and the finish is very hoppy, very bitter. However, it's like Alpine and their IPAs : sure they're classics, but nowadays, they're nothing exceptional. Now in Europe we get better IPAs from Omnipollo or Oppigards. And we have access to quite a few great American IPAs as well. So as far as American IPAs go, I believe that AleSmith or Bells are much better. You may find that Stone IPA is cheaper in the US than the ones I've mentioned, but for a German brewed product, I've had this one for 4.1 € per 33 cl can, more than an imported Torpedo IPA, and a similar price to what I paid for an imported Bell's Two Hearted Ale. It's brewed right next door, it should be cheaper than the ones crossing the Atlantic... In any case, it may have been a classic 19 years ago, but it ain't one now. Now it's "just" a well done West Coast IPA.

Very less fruity, almost all about the bitterness. Does it age that bad? the third taste confirm the second one : it's a lot about a grapefruit bitterness and citrus acidity. Not much of melon anymore. The melon comes back a bit in the smell as it's warming up. Also the head doesn't stay long. I have to lower my ratings.

Big lasting head on top of a light amber brew.. Aroma from a distance was strong and beery. A close sniff yielded a fine delicate hop aroma. Taste was a powerful bitter blast of hops     My preference these days is for a maltier, more balanced brew, with a similar color to this one. Stone IPA probably has some of the character of the old Ballantine ale from Newark (pre 1970). The Ballantine had a similar color, a rocky, long lasting head, big aroma, and possibly a bit more malt character.  _____________________________________________  Cask Stone IPA was found at BBD in Rocky Point NY in July, 2017. The cask version was expertly served with appropriate low carbonation and temperature, about 60F. This serving style knocks the edges off the hoppy character to produce a full flavored, balanced ale. One of the two or three best cask beers I've encountered (Blue Point ESB and an old version of Bridgeport Porter are two competitors).

Taste: Hops and pine resin leave a lingering bitterness, with the subtle fruit flavors appearing within.    Overall: Had a the Firkin Fest 2016 in Ashland, KY. I am surprised I haven't had this yet, since I see it all the time at the store. Regardless, I haven't and I saw it, so I tried it. Judging from Stone's style, I am not surprised this is bitter and earthy, but definitely good.

The smell is pine resin up front with a bit of citrus underneath.    The taste is very pine forward and lingers with a piney bitterness long after it's gone. There's a slight citrus moment in the middle.    The mouthfeel is slightly thick and oily with medium carbonation.    Overall a decent beer but the finish is a bit much for me.

Clear orange amber color with one and a half finger foamy white head, it has good retention and leaves lot of lacing patch and spot once gradually dissipated along with everlasting frothy sheet atop.    The aroma is predominated by hops with a citrus, lemon, piney, spicy, and herbal notes. There is also some sweet bready malt in the background too.    Hops forward in the taste disclosing many characters ranging from spicy, bitter, piney, citrusy, lemony, and herbal. That is so great hop profile. A flash of malt is in the flavor compartment too but in subtle fashion while hops still continue to dominate and wrap all the things up to make a robust yet clean bitter finish.    Medium body with smooth mouthfeel along with a touch of lively carbonation through the palate, crisp and refreshing, finish is dry.    Example of classic American IPA, no need to add in any twist or experimental ingredient, it is just great by the simplicity and great hoppy profile.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 One of the more drinkable (without being watery) IPAs I've ever had. Pretty almost orangish color with a thick slightly off white head. The smell is more subtle than most west coast IPAs, as is the taste. The bitterness is muted (somewhat) and it's missing the intense grapefruit of many west coasters. Complex yet drinkable. I could drink all night.

In all reality there's nothing particularly special about it except that it nails the style (at least in its west coast form). It is on the darker side for an IPA--more of a deep amber--but still within the range of normal. The smell is citrusy and dank, and the taste has that light-ish, more aromatic than bitter profile that characterizes west coast ipas.

A: Golden amber colour, slight haze, one finger sized head, moderate retention, decent amount of lacing.     S: Citrus and grapefruit, Cascade bomb.     T: Wheat, pine and grapefruit. High on bitterness but kept it subtle and balanced.     M: Low carbonation, medium body, went down well.     O: I can’t really add too much to what has already been said, but the quality of Stone beers brewed in Berlin has held up. This is a classy American IPA.

But, Stone's hop combos are too different from the classic Northern California style that I most appreciate (like Anchor Liberty.)   Stone's IPA starts with semi-clear, light amber Looks and the mostly citrus (some pine) Smells. But the Tastes initial malt sweetness just gets whacked by that combo of hops and its bitterness continues into a way-to-dry finish.   OA: I didn't like Stone IPA the first time I Had it and certainly not the second for this review. I doubt there will be a third.    Stone's IPA is reviewed on the "1001" list, I presume, because it is popular and it helped define the hoppy revolution that emerged from San Diego. But, Stone's IPA would not be in my book.

Aromas of orange, grapefruit, and pleasant cracker malts.     Very strong notes of pine and a pleasant under layer of onion. What surprises me here and what brings a welcome appearance is a nice malt backbone to balance things out.     A crisp carbonation follows through on the feel and provides perfect stability for the flavors.     Overall, Stone IPA was better than anticipated. I was expecting an onion bomb but pleasantly surprised here. Will have again.        Edit, had another one. Fresh from the bottle poured into glass. It was all onion, pine, and utter bitterness. One noted. Just gross. Dumped it.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 This beer pours a barely hazy pale orange with a medium well sustained head. The offers up caramel, orange peel, grapefruit peel, lemon peel, and a huge dose of dank herbal and piney notes. The flavor starts with some quick citrus, followed by a much larger wallop of dank herbal notes and a lot of dark pine, and finishing in a mellow but bitter caramel flavor. The mouthfeel is full but refreshingly fizzy. Overall this is an awesome beer. While caramel-pine west coast IPAs are not my favorite, it is impossible to ignore how well this beer is done. The caramel tones are present but not overwhelming, and there is a great dose of bitterness to compliment. Really a standout in the corner of the IPA world.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3.75 This one pours a hazy amber orange color with a soapy bone colored head.    The smell is an IPA smell of pine and floral with some mustiness.    The taste was a piney somewhat bitter taste with some light malt backbone.    The mouth feel is actually nice and light, easy drinking with a crisp finish.    I really liked this IPA offering from Stone. High points for me were in the taste and mouth feel. This beer is tasty and easy drinking giving some good happy points. The downside to this one is the price point. And I know that may be knit picking but I can easily find some good tasty IPA's for quite a bit less. And that just hurts a bit because if the price were a bit lower I could see this one in my shopping cart more often.

I grew up in SD not too far from classic iconic breweries such as pizza port, port, lost abbey and of course STONE. Here is my first time reviewing the beer:    Appearance. Yellowish Orange, Gold hues and not exactly amber. Decent little white head. Small bubbles shooting towards the surface.     Aroma: get a little pine, a little grapefruit, bready malt characteristics with an evident caramel sweetness    Taste: its crazy how after years of acclimating the palate with hundreds and hundreds of IPA's this particular beer is not super bitter, super hoppy or super aggressive at all, the way I used to perceive it back in the day. It tastes very balanced. The Hops, the yeast, the Malts all come together in a highly drinkable brew but its not super impressive the way I used to think it was. It's a solid go to but doesn't have much depth or any distinct highlights worth discussing. It is lemony and citrusy of course and a dry decent finish.    Mouthfeel: it's pretty light, its got that standard carbonation. Holds itself together nicely but yea about a light medium feel.     Overall: I respect this beer. It's a pioneer and a game changer. This bitter grassy piney bomb changed the way I started drinking, purchasing and talking about beer. Cheers mofos.

Appearance: Golden/orange in color. About 1.5 fingers of white foamy head   Smell:Plenty of hops aroma with a mix of citrus.   Taste: Complex mixture of balanced bitterness and sweetness. Goes down pretty easily with only a mildly bitter aftertaste.   Mouthfeel: Smooth and full-bodied with a moderate level of carbonation.   Overall: Along with Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA, this is the gold standard of IPAs that I compare all other IPAs to. Great beer overall.

Chilled to 39 degrees, allowed to sit for 5 minutes at room temp, poured into a large, stemmed wineglass.    Look: Slightly hazy straw gold color with a 3/4" foamy white head that held up well, eventually reducing to a 1/8" foam ring that lasted to the end due to a light but constant carbonation. Strong lacing throughout.    Smell: Sweet floral, pine and citrus hops with a damp earth undertone. Pleasant maltiness    Taste: Flavors of grass and pine resins, solid malt back end but hops dominate.    Mouthfeel: Medium to full body, slightly oily and smooth    Overall: Kick ass IPA, reinforces my love of Stone Brewing Co. This one hits on all cylinders, I could drink this like a session beer but with. 6.9% ABV I would (gladly) pay for it later.

I've got to say that I don't think Stone IPA is as good as it once was. A tad disappointing compared to how good this used to be.

The bouquet is citric, piney, floral and herbal, and it gives a slight hint of diacetyl after an energetic swirl.     Upfront you get to enjoy the carbonation and a perfect mixture of the malty sweetness, citric, herbal floral and piney flavors and the abundant bitterness. Starts off balanced, but the bitterness begins to kick when it heads to the finish, which is long. The hoppy flavors are very assertive all throughout this beer, which is scrumptious. You do get a little bit of the alcohol.   Medium body, smooth and silky.     Excellent beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Solid. Given the expansion of the style since its debut, I'll even say it's downright ordinary by now. But that doesn't make it bad. Pours light, crisp, clear, and golden. Tame nose with the requisite pine and lemon notes. Bitterness hits you in the back after a clean, smooth, and refreshing front end. I can't complain, yet I'm not quite ready to celebrate.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 I'm typically a dark beer guy: porters, stouts, etc...but I've been delving into weissbeer and IPA's lately. Stone IPA is well crafted. However, it is very floral and extremely dry. Not my cup of tea, but seems to accomplish its mission based on the many positive reviews. Prefer Terrapin Hi-Five to Stone IPA

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This beer opened up my palate to Stone and is the biggest reason why Stone is in my top 5 favorite breweries  Look: Dark and gold. The head did not dissipate at all. Lacing was amazing.   Smell: It was a few weeks past the best by date and it still had fresh, fresh hoppy goodness to it. Piney, citrusy, floral   taste: Stone likes to boast about hops, but this is balanced well with malts. Nice pale malts match the bitter hops  Mouthfeel: smooth, pleasant, well carbonated.   Overall: Great IPA. Got me in to Stone and I've been trying have my home IPAs match this. Amazing
