look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 A pretty mahogany color with a light tan head. Aromas is butter, wine, toffee & malted grain. Nice balance of sweet, salty & bitter with the nod to sweet. Nice flavor: grapes, wine, malt, toffe, banana & not much alcohol unless you look for it, then it moves up front with a bittter finish. Medium body, very smooth with a slightl deficit of carbonation but plenty of alcohol to occupy the the tongue. An excellent quad.

Pours a dark ruby amber, opaque, with a two inch foamy head on an average pour. Great retention, lots of foamy lacing. Aromas of plums, grapes, malt, dates, figs, some brown sugar, light wine, light peppercorns in the head when warm. The taste is plums, malt, grapes, toffee, dates, some figs and caramel, light wine. Very smooth, creamy, a solid full body, well carbonated.    Great flavor and aroma, terrific mouthfeel, a classic rendition of the style. Well worth a purchase.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A complex Belgian quad, this ale presents a variety of flavor in the initial sip, across the tongue, and through the aftertaste. It’s got a fascinating sweet-bitter thing going on, probably beyond my ability to properly describe. I’ve seen other reviews that warn of drinking this too early, and I may be in the same boat, with my bottle being a consume by 31 January 2023 vintage. I’m also drinking it a bit colder than recommended. Anyway, it’s pretty good, and I’m looking forward to trying another one. 2019/02/03

L: Deep cooper with big tan head with long retention and good lacing.  S: Strong dark fruit (raisin, fig), banana, bready. Just a hint of alcohol.  T: Bready, lots of raisin, molasses. Very long, dry, warm finish. Very complex but nicely balanced.  F: Carbonation is well integrated into the beer. Creamy, medium-full body.   O: Superb. This is a perfect example of a Belgian Quad and leaves very little room for improvement. I've had it side-by-side with Westvleteren 12 and although slightly different, in a blind test I could see myself choosing both as a "better" beer depending on the day. High praise for a beer easily available on grocery store shelves.

Aromas of stiff malt and light plum upfront, with wisps of yeast, lightly acerbic red wine grape must, hints of buttered banana bread, and smoky toffee building through the rest of the bouquet restrained slightly by minor boozy tones.    Taste bursts with sticky malt character; caramel, dry toffee, unripened banana, toasted wood, dark fruit juice, and unripened plums; plenty of booze sneaks from the mid-palate through to the finish.    Mouthfeel is silky and balanced, with a medium, verging toward heavy body and excellently integrated carbonation; robust, and with a comfortable yeasty weight that’s equal parts delicate, dry, and soothing through the finish.    The depth and complexity this quad begins to show is nothing short of incredible, but at just a few weeks shy of a year in the bottle, it’s a victim of its age; booziness and other indications of a too-short time in the bottle hold this one back just a bit too much. I can’t help but treat this as purely a review for posterity’s sake, because as of right now, this is a solid quad (if not somewhat disordered); in a few years’ time, however, I can’t see this becoming anything but something special, and I sure as hell look forward to that chance to revisit.

Warm sensation from alcohol but very smooth.     Overall, Rochefort 10 is a very sophisticated Belgian Quad with a heavy emphasis on roasty, malty flavor. The complicated body gives me a slightly new sense of flavor in every sip. It is a good quad to enjoy with those who have basic understanding of Trappist beer. Not recommended to a beginner.

Belgian quadrupels ( I mean the ones made in Belgium) are usually on the spot every time, but this one outstands.  Pours as a dark brown/very dark red liquid. Smells and tastes like spicy chestnuts, toffee, a little hint of bananas, and the 11.3% alcohol content should not intimidate you because it's very well hidden in a very complex, delicious and well balanced beer.  Give yourself this treat of a very excellent beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 poured into a snifter.    appearance: 2 finger tan head, very frothy. dissolves to a very creamy cap. beer itself appears to be brown with garnet highlights.     smell: very sweet. strong notes of caramel with a bit of raisin and a dash of stonefruit.     taste: initial taste is very malty and phenolic. as it sits it grows into a mix of molasses and brown sugar, accented by notes of spice. the aftertaste is mildly bitter with the spice taking a back seat and the molasses-like flavor lingering. the alcohol is definitely noticeable, sitting at 11.3%, but it isn't overpowering.    feel: lots of body in this beer. very creamy and thick, it sticks to the tongue and mouth. definitely a sipper.    overall: an excellent quad. it's easily drinkable, despite (or perhaps because of) the sweetness and the velvety smooth mouthfeel. definitely one of my favorites, although for around $8 per bottle it's not something i'd drink every day.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle into a Shaker pint glass, the "best by" date on bottle is "L.31.01.2023" which I understand to mean this beer was brewed on January 31, 2018 as the recommended shelf life is 5 years..    APPEARANCE: pours a dark, brown color with two-fingers tan head, world class retention, a thick cap of foam persisted until the last, heavy lacing on the glass, medium carbonation (I think?), I have not seen a better looking beer, I seriously considered scoring as 5 but, I do not believe in perfection.    SMELL: in a word.....spectacular, initially bread, molasses, sweet raisins, figs and black licorice, very complex and pleasant to the nose, I again almost gave this a 5.    TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet molasses, raisins, figs, black licorice and bread, the 11.3% ABV is very well disguised.    PALATE: full bodied with medium carbonation.    OVERALL: this is an absolutely gorgeous beer and the smell is unparalleled, this was a real treat and I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, this is the best Quad I have had to date, I will highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the style and will definitely buy this again, well done!

A: Pours a dark turbid brown, leaving sediment in bottle. Head is tan with large bubbles that fall quickly (refreshed by swirling). Champaign quality. Legs on glass suggest this is a high alcohol offering.   T: Big, bold, bready malt dominates the front palette. Following are big notes of rummy raisins and a warm alcohol presence which gives away the high alcohol content. Hint of bubblegum in the middle. The end of the sip offers more bready malt and a long warm finish. No apparent hop charater.   O: There is a alot going on here. From the bready malts to the boozy raisins this high ABV quad offers just about everything one would be looking for in this style. While it is clear this is a high ABV, it is actually surprising that it clocks in at 11.3%

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 A 330ml bottle, with a best before date of 3rd October 2022. Poured into a Chimay goblet.    Appearance: Dark brown in colour with an almost two finger tanned head that had decent retention but eventually settled to a nice self replenishing cap while leaving nice curtain like lacing.    Aroma: Strong dark fruits, plum, dates, raisin, black currants, caramel, light roast, toasted bread with a hint of clove and bubblegum.    Taste: Lightly sweet, dark fruits, plum, raisin, dates, fig, black currant, candied sugar, caramel with light banana and clove.    Mouthfeel: Creamy, light syrup, light booze, medium to full bodied with moderate to low carbonation.    Overall: Excellent, just so good. This is easily my favourite Trappist Quadrupel out there. It’s just so balanced, tasty and a joy to drink.

I was a little surprised that the Rochefort 10 didn't grab me more. It's good, to be sure, but not as remarkable as I hoped, and not quite in the same ballpark as some of my favorite quads, BDSAs, or other strong beers. The body of the beer was a little lighter than I expected. It's a bit tart. Of course, there are lots of dark fruit flavors.     The Westy 12 was three years old, and the Rochefort 10 was a few months off the store shelf, so that might be a factor. I think I'll sock a couple of bottles away, and taste again in a couple of years, to see whether my opinions change. If so, I'll update this review.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Rochefort 10 - 11.3% ABV - 27 IBUs  Date: Best by 01/31/22, enjoyed on 08/28/18.  Appearance: Brown, almost cola colored with some ruby around the edges and a fizzy tan head that disappears fast. Also, there is a lot of yeast floating around.  Aroma: Tons of dark fruits including dates, figs, raisin and cherry. Aromas of sweet bourbon, molasses based dark rum, and caramelized coconut sugar are identifiable as well. Some Belgian yeast can be detected also.   Taste: The taste follows the nose quite closely. First a nice boozy oak warmth hits before the beer repeats everything the nose had to offer. With every sip, the beer seems to change just a little, at times almost feeling like a porter to occasionally displaying cognac characteristics. It also surprisingly has more of a medium body than its thick and chewy appearance suggests. Additionally, the carbonation is somewhat prickly. Its sweet and savory in perfect balance and the boozy character, while present is more warming and not at all ethanol forward. In short, this is a wonderful, complex, and classic example of the style.   Biased comments: The lofty expectations I had for this beer were met. Rochefort 10 has a truly incredible aroma, a complex and layered taste, the only real minor issue here is the price tag. $8 a beer is a bit steep, but for an occasional treat, this is a awesome choice.

Not all that much lacing, and minimal head, but a beautiful near-black dark amber hue.    Smell: Despite its higher alcohol content, somehow phenol dominates less here than it does in the Rochefort 8. Slight notes of plum, a bit less banana than the 8, and some bready notes.    Taste: World-class. What the Rochefort 10 lacks in definitive scent, it more than makes up for in flavor — a perfectly-aged blend of plum, fig, banana, and bread, with just enough Candi sugar to accent the already-sweet harmony of tastes.    Feel: By far the smoothest of the Rochefort lineup, with carbonation so minimal that it evokes a fine dessert wine. And for Trappistes' highest-ABV offering, it even has even less alcoholic burn than the Rochefort 8.    Overall: I don't think much else needs to be said, lest I repeat what nearly 10,000 ratings have already noted. This is one of the best beers in the world. Drink it. Love it.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.75 Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a goblet.    Look - A beautiful reddish brown with a massive and long-standing pillowy sandy colored head. This beer is a gorgeous pour.    Smell - Bananas, cloves, milk chocolate, almonds. Some slight peppery and grassy notes on the tail end. A nice balanced blend featuring the typical Belgian ale features and some interesting newcomers.    Taste - The smell translates almost one-to-one into the taste, except everything is hidden behind a strong spicy alcohol curtain. You can taste every bit of the 11.3%.    Feel - The body and carbonation are easy and smooth, but the alcohol really bites going down. It's rough and a bit disappointing.    Overall - I want to love this beer, but the alcohol is so hard to get through. I've had plenty of other high ABV Belgian ales that were super smooth and easy to drink, but this one is not one of them. Still, once you get past the harshness, it is a wonderful beer.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 I would prefer to grade it based on a few glasses from a keg but I've only found it in the bottle. Like others of this type (Belgian tripel/Quadrupel) the taste is very smooth for the ABV level. (If you have more than two, have a designated driver or call for an Uber or Lyft!)    I drank it an a bar outside so it was served with a standard plastic cup. (Still a better option than out of the bottle.) Despite the less-than-optimal choice of serving method, the beer poured well with the right amount of head. The feel is smooth on the palate (I hate lagers because they are too bubbly!). Alas, it's been a couple of weeks since I tried the beer so I don't remember the smell other than it was pleasant.    Now the downside. It's expensive. Granted, I live in Northern New Jersey where everything is expensive but the beer is $7 a bottle at a discount store (Total Wine). (I paid $9 at the bar during happy hour. The regular price is $14.)

What sets this beer apart is a truly exclusive bite/burn with even small sips. Really excites the palate. This, combined with the molasses rich flavor and modest spice (tastes and smells like clove and maybe even coriander) makes this an unforgettable beer.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pouring from an 11.2 oz bottle into a chimay goblet. This beer pours out the color of a cola and has light tan bubbles forming throughout the entire pour. Forms in the glass dark brown with Ruby and mahogany highlights. The smell has sweet notes that if I have ever detected in beer, I honestly don't remember. Very unique. I really don't know what to call it. Almost similar to a Carmel apple maybe but that's definitely not all. Has a little bit of an alcohol smell. The taste brings in that same sweetness along with some fruit notes. Alcohol is present with a slight burn in the mouthfeel. I think this is where it could find more balance. Overall, I enjoyed it but do feel like it could balance the alcohol out better (even for being 11%) and I feel like I have had more complex quads. Or maybe I'm just upset I'm too basic to identify the sweetness coming through. Maybe both.

Smell: Malt, caramel/toffee, some plum.  Taste: following the mouth. Sweetness of malt, caramel, and dry fruits. Honeyed. Alcohol is present but smoothly so. I'd describe it as brandy-like, for some reason.  Feel: bodied and alcoholic. Carbonation is medium to high and "prickly". Not strongly astringent but the aftertaste is not too sweet as well.  Overall: extraordinary. Enjoy every sip of it... with care.

The beer's head has an interesting, almost original build to it.  S- The aroma is pretty faint, but still nice. I get dried fruit, molasses cherry, molasses, grape/wine, alcoholic booziness, maybe some liqueur, a little bit of fortified wine, slight clove and banana as well as some prominent yeast. By the way, the aroma gets better as it warms.  T- Sweet cherry, molasses, banana, dried fruit, slight spice, even slighter bitterness. Very malty and rich. Overall very, very nice, well crafted Quad with very straight forward and honest flavors.  F- Low carbonation, dry.  O- This beer sticks perfectly with the style. It's extremely well crafted and worth a try for sure.

Gorgeous beige head atop a murky brown body, great lacing. Fragrant fruity, boozey smell.     I love the way this beer warms! So many flavors come out. Dark fruit, raisin, plums, apples, pears. Almonds, cashews, nutmeg, cinnamon. Warm and comforting. Loved it!

This is a real treat and at 11% I’ll bet I feel it for a long time.

The flavours are intense, but incredibly balanced. A little bit of bitterness left once swallowed, very dry!     The flavour is incredible. It has that Begian esquisses, its complex with a lot of depth.     Would never guess its as strong at +11%, what a beer!  HB 1

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 Rochefort 10, heard so much about ya. Have had the 6 & 8 and not impressed. Have high hopes for this since it's well....in the top 250. Let's see if it stays true to the hype.    Bottle good til 2021 poured into goblet at cellar temp:    L: chocolate brown with misty head and so far looks better than the 6 & 8. Although there is quite a bit of sediment left at bottom of bottle. Nevertheless doesn't quite have the appeal as other Belgian trappistry beers such as St. Bernardus or Chimmay.    A: chocolate covered dark fruit, malt, brown sugar, Belgian sugar, and Belgian yeast. But really hard to grasp. A bit mild in the scent so really have to unravel it.    Mf: heavy yet creamy and thin, but fizzy with some hops. Some alcohol presence but very mild and very smooth, especially for 11% abv.    T: prunes, rum soaked raisins, chocolate, Dr. Pepper, Cola, dates, brown sugar, slightly sour in the finish.    O: In the end I'd rather have a Chimmay Blue but this is the best of the Rocheforts. I give the above 4 rating mainly for how smooth it is for 11% abv.

After letting it heat up more flavor notes come out - prune, dark soughtly sour cherry, strong clove spice, belgian yeast bready quality, and slight heat on the back but very welcoming. Mouthfeel is thinner than I expected but still a substantial viscosity and coverage on the tongue, medium carbonation.    I think this bottle could use some aging. More smoothness and rounded out flavors and ending spice/alcohol notes.

Smell: Dark and vinous on the nose. Reminds me of sticking my nose in a glass of termpernillo. Notes of dried fig, honey covered dates, whole wheat raisin bread, molasses, earthy damp cellar, and a pronounced alcohol.     Taste: Surprisingly fruity on the attack with notes of fresh fig, fresh dates, and a plum. This fades slowly to a body of raw honey, molasses, dark chocolate covered dark cherries, whole grain bread, a lightly umami note like portobello mushrooms, caramelized raisins, light baking spices, fig jam, and a warm pronounced alcohol.     Feel: Big bodies. Thick and sticky on the palate. Quenching on the body with a bone dry finish. Warm alcohol that is just a bit abrasive. Carbonation is medium and helps the beer move quicker across the palate then the body would suggest.     Overall: A truly world class Belgian Quad. The beer is rich and complex while staying subtle and nuanced. It’s big for sure but the flavors stay smooth and delicate. It is pretty amazing how clean each flavors is. It never even comes close to desert level sweetness or a sugar bomb like some Quads can wind up being. If I were to nitpick the alcohol is just a hair too much but aging might smooth it out a bit. A real treat.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 From a 12oz bottle with a best by date of 13.10.2020. Pours a cloudy, dark reddish-brown with a modest tan head that quickly dissipates. Dark fruit flavors, toasted malt and alcohol on the nose and palate. Very well made, to be sure, but perhaps not my most favorite beer given the high ABV. Best with food, I suspect.

It pours dark red with a tight creamy head that dissipates pretty quickly.    The aroma is a viney boozy fig type smell and I immediately think of strong cheddar for some reason.    The flavour continues where the aroma left off: boozy fig juice. A great beer.

Compared to St. Bernardus 12, I feel the flavors are more subdued and harmonious. Dark fruit flavors are dominant but not overpowering, and the alcohol taste is hard to find. I'd prefer this beer in the mid-afternoon without a food accompaniment, whereas St. Bernardus 12 would be better suited with a heavy meal. This is a beer I'll come back to as a great example of a well-crafted quad and one that I could enjoy outside of winter.

You feel the beer's medicinal/alcohol taste will last, but it finishes much smoother than that, with out leaving any terrible after taste. The mouth-feel is very soft, velvety-like. Though I love Quads, this one was not something I would order again. I am just not a fan of anything resembling Jagermeister.

A big earthy malty yeast taste dominates with toasted nuts. Sweet malty start gives way to a rich boozy dried prune. The fruit mingles with a tart tangy prickly carbonation that balances nicely. A hot boozy feeling builds up if you drink it too fast. This beer is excellent if consumed at the correct temperature. Not so good right out of the fridge.

Well crafted and enjoyable for sure. My favorite and may be the bedt beer on the planet. I highly recommend .

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 I love this beer! And I still recall the first time I tried it... I bought the 6, 8 and the 10 to try, and I tried them in that order. All of them are great. The 10 is definitely my favorite (quads are my preferred style, in general.) This beer pours a deep reddish-brown color, and you need to pour carefully, as it foams up easily, and the foam doesn't dissipate all that fast. The aroma is very rich - sweet, malty with hints of fruits and wine. The carbonation is playful on the tongue, and for the ABV, it's not all that heavy. In fact, it's dangerously easy to drink! I highly recommend that if you serve this from the refrigerator, that you allow it to warm up about 10 degrees, or so before consuming. The malts pop and you'll get a lot more complexity. The only drawback is that it's hard to find this for less than $7/bottle in Michigan.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This beer is definitely a must try. I was surprised at the carbonation in this beer, looking at it originally I expected a creamy and heavy dark beer but it really feels great. (not that creamy and heavy beers dont feel great...) This beer was just very good all around and I would recommend it to anyone. Cheers!

F: Reasonable carbonation, but that's it.    Super lame and unpleasant, waste of money at 0.61¢/oz. St. Bernardus Abt 12 (another quadrupel) is far superior to this brew (at 0.35¢/oz), about half the price.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 11.2 oz bottle poured into a tulip. Very dark mahogany brown, topped by one finger's worth of tan head that quickly falls to a thin film in short order. Spotty lacing.    Aroma presents sweet malts, dark fruits, and spicy undertones, and an almost medicinal hit of alcohol.    Flavors come in sweet- toffee, dark fruit (raisin, plum), along with a sharp (but not unpleasant) alcohol tang. Spice flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove follow in soon after. The finish is semi-dry and warming, with lingering peppery-ness and toasted dark bread malt.    Mouth-feel is on the "full" side of medium-bodied, smooth but with tingling accents from the brisk carbonation. The 11.3 % ABV is quite assertive- you'll know you're drinking a BIG beer, here- but it never quite crosses the line into being "hot."    Rochefort 10 is pretty much the exemplar of what a Belgian Quad should be. Big, complex, assertive, and booze-y, with wonderful fruit complexity. The sweet/spicy contrast of the malts and the yeast works beautifully here with the alcohol lending a fortifying warmth. One of the all-time great sipping beers, to be sure.

Conservative retention is suggestive of the 11.3% ABV. (5)    S - Chocolate, Plum, Rasin, Caramel and hints of sweet Cherry make for quite a complex and impactful aroma. Absolutely no alcohol in the nose...quite impressive. (5)    T - It's like drinking a liquid Tootsie Roll. You are first engaged with sweet flavors Caramel and Chocolate followed by some juicy dark fruits. No perceptible warming in the chest even after it has warmed to room temperature. (5)    M - With only a Medium+ body, it drinks much lighter than most other beers clocking in at over 10%. It possesses both a creamy carbonation and finishes quite dry enhancing its drinkability...you will be reaching to take another sip much more quickly than one would think. (5)    O - This is my first experience with Rochefort 10 and drinking it in Belgium for 2.28Euro from the grocery store is pretty epic. Although better than Saint Bernardus Abt12 but ever-so-slightly less impactful than Westvleteren 12, this is an absolute worthy alternative (not to mention supreme accessibility). I can find no fault with this Quadruple and think it is one of the benchmarks for the style. Very much worthy of a perfect score. (5)   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This was an ok belgian quad. It was overly carbed to my taste and sweet notes in the palate. Maybe needed to age it a little longer but this didn't do it for me.

Candied dark fruit and boozy scent assaults the nose (in a good way)! Caramel malt, candied fruits and a bit of alcohol in the mouth. For some reason, I smelled it and saw a fruitcake in my mind. Feels wonderful in the mouth as well. Wow!   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Tasted with a year and a quarter of age on this one    L -- Pours a beautiful nectarine flesh colored body with a large, dense off-white head produced by gentle pour. Great retention and lacing   S -- Raspberries, strawberries, peach, plum, booze, candied dark fruits, warming spices, caramel, toffee, and a hint of doughy yeastiness. Incredibly nuanced   T -- A little sharp on the booziness, but there is great complexity lingering in the background. Yeasty spiciness, vanilla, caramel malts, raspberries, currants, bourbon, oak, brown sugar, and earth   F -- Silky and mouth-coating. The high carbonation is comprised of very tiny bubbles, which seem to give the beer a third dimensionality as it jumps off the palate   O -- Would love to try this side-by-side with St Bernardus 12. Really nice fruitiness throughout, and pretty reasonably priced @ ~$7/12oz bottle. Tastes even better with the bottom sediment mixed in    92/100    EDIT(10/25/18):  Finally trying this side by side with Abt 12! Slightly better head retention and lacing, although the bodies are the same deep mahogany brown with modest clarity. Still getting the same berry aromas, but this time I'm noticing a distinct orange sherbert character overlying everything, kinda like Tang or something. It's a little distracting. This carries over on the flavors. Mouthfeel is less silky than I recall, but is still very nice. Overall I'm sticking to my original feelings: Abt 12 is just a hair better, although this is more assertive in aromas, flavors, and mouthfeel (and ABV).    89/100

Beer and chocolate trapped into one single glass, a liquid milky draught with a backbone of bitter malt.

Very clear contrast between the cream-colored head and the deep brown beer.  Smell: Pleasant and satisfying. Almost fruity or floral, but definitely not too cloying. A bit smoky, even?  Taste: Rich, with some sweetness, but mostly a range similar to what you would find in stouts, including some grain.  Feel: Carbonation and bitterness noticeable but not overpowering, indeed well-balanced. Very smooth overall.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Look: One finger brown-white head, hazy brown body. The head lasts unnaturally long.    Smell: See below, but the smell is more fruit forward with less spices. Slightly less complex than the taste.    Taste: Brown sugar, earthy yeast, spices (nutmeg, clove, cinnamon, anise), mild dark dried fruits. A bit of apple in the finish.    Feel: High carbonation, medium body, sweet upfront with a semi-dry finish. A small alcohol bite, plus warmth. The bite disappears as it warms up.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Cellared 3 years, 1 month    Poured into a tulip    Appearance: hazelnut brown with some haze. This beer is highly carbonated with light tan bubbles, which resemble the head of a Coke when poured warm.    Aroma: definitely Belgian. The sweetness comes through. Blindfolded, you would know this is a quad. Fruitcake-esque.    Flavor: sweet with dark fruits. This reminds me of a liquid fruitcake. Much less sweet many other brands (Carolous, Ovilia). There is a very faint anise in the background. Very little alcohol detectable even at 10% abv and no alcoholic heat.    Mouthfeel: medium bodied. Highly carbonated, almost spritzy with each sip.    Overall: this is worth trying, but it falls short of expectations. Chimay Blue is superior as are many domestic versions (Boulevard Sixth Glass, Victory V-12). The particular Rochefort 10 that I drank was cellared for over 3 years. I will try a fresh version of this beer. I should have done a side-by-side and compared the two to determine which was better.   
look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Exp. Date: 05.01.2022    Frothy, 3 fingers tall, off-white head, not persisting but leaving a small crown. Spare lacing. High malty, bready aroma upfront. Moderate estery notes, mostly raisins - dry fruits in general. High aroma of phenols. Spices,   soft alcohol hint. Seems like perfume, whiskey kind. Plenty of caramel. High malty sweetness. Very bready and rich. Medium-low bitterness. Medium-full body, oily, chewy, soft but very lively carbonation. Pleasent sweetness washed out from palate by medium dry finish. Some spiciness, some alcohol warms a throat very nicely.    Legendery

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Bottle is best before 23-8-2021 so probably just under a year old. Pours a deep mahogany with an incredible of very stable tan head. The head was surprisingly large for something of such a hefty abv and it stays for ages. Smell is loads of caramel and brown sugar, and lots of dried fruit-like aroma. Sorta like opening a tin of dates or dried figs. Flavor follows suit with boat loads of fruity character. Sorta like tobacco. If you ever rolled your own and opened up a new pouch of the good stuff, it's kinda like that. A light touch of caramel sweetness and then a bit of booze. Feel is full bodied with a touch more alcohol burn than I like, but I suppose some careful aging could have helped there, and it's a bit expected with a double digit abv. Overall, this stuff is phenomenal. Complex and hearty, and definitely the best quad I've ever had.   
look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Deep brown beauty, creamy head and lacing.   Nose is molasses, dark fruit/ raisin and an unknown spice note, swimming in a hint of alcohol.   Taste is a bready/ caramel/ molasses/ coconut combo. Interesting, but with a spicy bite at the end. As it warms, richer flavor such as chocolate comes forth. Fairly complex stuff.   Feels well-carbonated and fairly thick.   I recall having this a long while back. I also recall it being even better. This is still a terrific Belgium Trappist beer.

This beer tastes pretty close to an aventinus eisbock to me. The feel is warm and delightful.Overall a very good beer, a might pricey but worth it if tasted only once.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Best by 2021  330 ml bottle poured into a large tulip.    Two fingers of dense tan foam top a deep caramel brown pour that is even darker stacked in the glass only allowing minimal light around the edges. The head is short lived but a nice cap remains, regenerating with every swirl and leaving nice lacing.     Caramel, molasses, dark fruit and a bit of alcohol make up the moderate nose. Taste is fairly sweet but not cloying. Dark fruit, particularly plum and raisin along with cocoa, fudge and fleeting hints of coconut make up the flavor profile. There is plenty of heat right through to the slightly tangy and somewhat drawn out finish.  Medium bodied and very smooth there is only a small bite from carbonation.    To me this was really hot. I am thinking that this particular bottle needed some more age.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Appearance: Pours a beautiful dark brown with a light tan head. Gorgeous head that lingers long after pouring, very fine bubbles, wonderful lacing. A very pretty beer.    Aroma: Very complex aroma of dark fruits, with none specifically overwhelming, very balanced scent. More dark fruits, perhaps a bit of cherry, raisins, brown sugar, bread, even a hint of grape. No alcohol on the nose, beautifully balanced creamy scent.    Mouthfeel: Unbelievable, smooth as milk. Thick and creamy. Very light carbonation. Top marks here.    Taste: Raisin, fig, vanilla, wine, beautifully balanced. The alcohol is hidden exceptionally considering its ABV. It has a gorgeous creaminess that is reminiscent of a nitro. The taste has a mellow lingering taste that gives hints of chocolate, cherry, honey, vanilla, and rye. Very mature and exceptionally balanced taste.    Overall: This beer absolutely deserves its rating. It is a gem and potentially one of the best. Its spot on depth and balance turn it into something ephemeral. This was part of a taste test including St Bernardus 12 and La Trappe Quad, and this won. It was more balanced and had a better mouthfeel than St Bernardus 12, and has more depth than La Trappe Quad. So, If you have not tried this beer, do so. If you only try one Quad let this be it.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 The appearance is a dark brown colored body with a two finger white foamy head that dies within thirty seconds, lacing tries to cling to the glass but slowly slides into the body. The smell is spicy yet somewhat has some sweet cherries, a little tartness comes through and some booziness. The taste is mainly spicy sweet booze, cherries become more of an undertone to the flavoring, big boozy aftertaste, and a dry spicy finish. On the palate, its about a medium to heavy, sturdy carbonation. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, it's a bit boozy, but over the years I've learned to accept it for what it is supposed to be.

The smell is of sweet malty molasses and sweet dried fruit. Taste follows the nose and there is a bit of alcohol burn although it hides the alcohol well, but there is also moderate astringency. Maybe it's the nature of Belgian beers but I'm not crazy about that yeasty soapy chalky quality. Feels medium bodied and a bit tingly with medium carbonation. Overall I'm not blown away and prefer St. Bernardus Abt 12.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Look: Pours a light mahogany color with a billowing three finger, khaki head of foam that laces the glass exquisitely.    Aroma: On the nose, sweet milk chocolate, red figs, dates, fresh baked pretzels, soft caramel and some floral notes of yeast akin to banana and clove.    Taste: Docile notes of sugarplums and sweet figs coupled with milk chocolate and gentle caramel. The initial flavors are complemented by a backdrop of clove, vanilla, banana and black pepper on the finish. There is a clean, soothing alcohol profile to it as it warms, and pleasantly, slightly tart notes of tamarind and orange pith emerge as it begins to open up.    Feel: Full bodied and creamy. Not overtly heavy, but rich. Mid-heavy mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. Very supple and smooth. 11.3% ABV is very well hidden, I've had 8% beers with heavier alcohol profiles.    Overall: Rochefort 10 is a velvety, silky Belgian Quad with rich flavors of candied red, fleshy fruits and milk chocolate with undertones of sweet, peppery, somewhat floral yeast on the finish. Although the flavor is rich, it is never unctuous, unduly sticky or cloying. The mouthfeel is exceptional and absolutely perfect for the style. Worth every penny.    Rating: [A] Outstanding. 4.79/5.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Best Before 02/17/2020: Pours so dark brown color that it looks black with a huge 2-3 finger thick foamy head that looked creamy on top and didn't budge for a while, literally about 5 minutes. The head was packed with bubbles and faded extremely slowly, leaving a creamy layer on top and nice spotty lacing.    Smells of malt, brown sugar, toffee, syrup, molasses, herbal notes, light peppery spices, dark fruit like cherry, raisin and plum, and then some mild booze like dark rum. Some peat moss and earthy notes come through late, along with more sugary sweetness, but overall this malt bomb smells really good.    Tastes starts off with bread crust, caramel, brown sugar and toasted grains, followed by dark fruit like raisin, cherry, plum and a rotting pear. The bready notes, yeast and peppery spices linger and bring out coriander or allspice, then shifts to dark rum and mild barnyard funk. Complex is an understatement, as this changes slightly with each sip with the one constant being malt dominant and tasty. It's got a kick, but it doesn't seem like an 11.30% ABV beer.    Mouthfeel is incredibly creamy and smooth, even with the alcohol burn and mild heat this brew manages to slide down easy. Very mellow carbonation, a medium to thick body and a nice balance of sweet and spicy make this a Belgian classic that finishes with peppery spices and a yeast driven chalky finish. Overall a really tasty and enjoyable slow sipper.

On a very gentle pour this beer produces a ton of head. Very thick and fluffy, it settles to around a good finger of khaki bubbles. Very good lacing. Perfect 5 here without a doubt.     S: Wow this is mouth watering. Lots of plum and raisins, brown sugar, maybe licorice as well. Smells absolutely delectable. On swirl the alcoholic phenols come out.     T: Lots of alcohol up front warms your face. Lots of rich ripe fruit flavors, plum and even grape. Brown sugars that have caramelized, some leafy hop hidden in there as well, and peppery notes too. Really complex.     F: Medium-Full, typical Belgian carbonation, incredibly smooth and creamy.     O: This is really an amazing beer. I could go on and on.

A very high alcohol beer going down like nothing. The carbonation feels great as well. Even though the alcohol is apparent in the flavor, it's barely noticeable in feel.  O: This is my first Belgian Quad and I fell in love. I love wine and this very much reminds me of it. I have nothing to compare it too since I've never had a Quad before, but I can vouch for it being an incredible brew.

Nice thick, rich bubbly light brown head.  Smell was faint raisin subtle fruity sweetness. Caramel even. Very pleasant, but the aroma was somewhat hard to detect, but its there.The alcohol smell took a slight precedence. Not a bad thing at all. It was not a cheap rubbing alcohol type smell whatsoever that i have found in some beers. Thin lace on the glass as i drank it down.  Taste is just as you would expect from the smell. Very subtle caramel/ chocolate overtones with a nice balance of dark fruit. Not too strong, but you know its there.   The finish is somewhat malty, but clear and clean, drinks like a fine wine almost.  Mouth feel is perfect. Well balanced and smooth. Mild carbonation. It all comes together just right.     This beer is not to be consumed ice cold of course, but I found it rather good at room temperature as well. Excellent to drink while having Long hookah smoke session.  Definitely a beer i woukd keep on hand at all times.

If you like Belgian Quads by all means give this a shot, its just not for me.

Medium bodied and nice level of carbonation. Overall this is a good beer just not my favorite style all the time. Wish there might have been a little more punch in the flavor.

Pours a dark swampy brown with a little sediment sinking to the bottom, and a frothy khaki crown that has fairly good retention. The nose is pretty amazing, with layers on layers of dark fruit, sweet and pungent spices, some dark chocolate and even some tannins. Taste follows, but man, this is boozy and sweet...and there's some rum-like notes that I didn't get in the nose. For the abv, the feel is probably spot on but...it's a little too much to be ideal for me. I'm rating to style, on the whole, and I can see why this has so many fans. It's a real treat, but for me it will be a rare one.

Bread rind, molasses, and earthy flavors come on strong at the beginning, although cherry tartness is evident over time. Bitterness moderate but blends very smoothly within the overall flavor picture.  M: Medium to full bodied with very lively carbonation, although leaning more to full. Swirling produces substantial clearing even late in consumption. Rich, complex, and very.  O: This is a World-Class ale. Saved it for Easter, seemed somehow appropriate given its origins.

O - Don't get me wrong, excellent brew, but the taste was a let down after an amazing aroma. Not as I remembered so perhaps its me, or perhaps the years have muted some of the flavor. Whatever the case, this one is for sipping, the alcohol is definitely there, and the flavors open up some as it sits.

Gently marzipan In the background liqueur notes of alcohol.  The taste is precious notes of alcohol, resembling, liqueurs, tinctures. Later, dark fruit, marzipan.  Alcohol is slightly perceptible, is definitely a noble form, heats, adds character but does not reject. Saturation average towards the low, I definitely will reply.

Nice half inch layer of foam sitting beautifully on top after settling  Aroma - plum, caramell, raisin, malts....amazing  Taste - follows the smell very well and has just the right amount of maltiness.  Feel - Smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation. 11.3% alcohol is hidden VERY well...  Overall - this is my holy grail of beers and I would drink this like water if I could. If you like belgian beers you cannot go wrong witht his one...if you can get it, DO IT.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 This beauty pours a deep, rich brown with a 2 finger head. There is lacing but it doesn't all stick. The smells are sweet and dark malts....   Wow, the alcohol is barking on this one. It goes down warm to the belly. But not in a bad way. The first flavor is actually the nice caramel malts, toffee, bready yeasts, nuttiness, a little bit of candy bar like sugars....and with the alcohol and heavy malts, this one is very creamy--but then BAM, the sizzle of the carbonation hits the mouth with some spices, and the palate is suddenly electrified with effervescence and a lovely dry finish. And you immediately want another sip--which is dangerous at ABV. You definitely have to tell yourself to slow down. Enjoy. This one is a treat and distinctly potable.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A - Cloudy brown body, with orange highlights, short tan head fades out quickly, leaving a thin ring at the edge. Visible carbonation keeps the beer moving minutes after the pour. It is a fine looking beer.    S - Booze is out and proud, with hints of tea and toffee, a bit of sugar, and strong dark fruit, prunes and raisins.    T - The open is sweet, with a candy note. Then comes a cherry hit, almonds and candied breads. The middle closes with a move away, toward more straight bread flavors. The close hits with some tea astringency that fades back into a long sweet dark bread note, molasses and brown sugar, that lingers. As it warms, the sugars come forward, and the bread takes on more caramel.    M - Brisk carbonation keeps this from getting syrupy or cloying, but the heft is there, a bit of alcohol warmth, and a slightly drier close that also helps clear the palate. This is one that has so many traps for the brewer, but the result walks that line and is delivers a nice, warm feel.    O - This is a profoundly well crafted brew, with depth in flavor and great feel. At over 11%, it could be a boozy mess, but it is instead a measured, tasty, developed experience. Another Belgian that shows just how good these styles can get.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Very dark pour, brown on verge of black with very heavy foam and lacing. Smells of malt, wine, and fruit.

This is a very nice beer to sip on a cool winter day with a fire going, well done.

Rather disappointing, as I've heard many great things. I'll update if I have this again though.

Yeast flavors give this a sharp but pleasant smoothness. Hints of roasted grains and brown bread are also present.     F- A bit of sharp carbonation and a fair amount of alcohol heat... Not easy to hide the high ABV but far from hot... Creamy and smoother than it has a right to be.    O- This is a quintessential Quad... Big, bad and packs a wallop with both complex and subtle flavors. Do not drink this on an empty stomach.

Delicious taste, great feel, and bottle is classy and stylish, just cool. Alcohol is a whopping 11.3% but it doesnt burn or be too harsh for me. I dont always like 9%++ beer. Chimay blue is like the perfect between average and high ABV% alcohol percentage. But yeah this beer is amazing, love it. Costs a lot and is premium high quality, I buy this every now and then, once or twice a year.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I am doing a comparison this weekend between this brew and St. Bernardus Abt.12. I have been cellaring this for 4 years.  It poured a murky brown color with a thin head that kept a constant ring.  Good spices complexity in the nose. Mild aroma with notes of cocoa, licorice, hay, plums, vanilla, mild clove, raisins and cinnamon.  Flavor with notes of cocoa, lots of spices (cloves, white and black pepper, ginger), candi sugar, lemon drops, orange marmalade, cinnamon, coconut, raisins, roses, more caramel than molasses, green apple juice, wood and definitely rum. Dry aftertaste with a medium bitterness and a spicy lingering note.  Bordering full body with somewhat effervescent carbonation. Alcohol of 11.3% is felt but it is in harmony with the overall beer.  Spicy and very flavorful Belgian Dark Strong Ale. Compared to St. Bernardus and Westvleteren, I found this more spicy, sweet and boozy, but a tad less complex, especially on malt profile, missing the myriad of chocolate and dark fruit notes. This time the bald monk will take the trophy home, better said to the monastery.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Smooth. Rich. Complex. Oh so yeasty!    What a fantastic beer. In the quad style, this one rates up there with the best. Not as complex and mystical as westvleteren 12 (but what is!). Not quite as robust and strong as St. Bernardus 12. But this bad boy holds its own. Get it!

Sticky and sweet all the way through, all the way to the end where there's an astringent finish. Delicious

Red wine. Caramel, bread, candi sugar.   M - heavy mouthfeel, alcohol present but appropriate, aftertaste is dark fruits, bread, mild Belgian yeast  O - I used to think this one was perfect, but these Belgian quads can be a bit overrated. Great beer don't get me wrong. Improvements could be made on the booziness.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours a dark, cloudy brown. In the appropriate glass, the thick, pillowy foam of eggshell head sits around for days, just bulging over the top of the chalice; be still, my beating heart. Spots of sediment finish that quad 'forbidden elixir' look.     The smell is alluring, but difficult to nail down. The immediate hit is bubblegum, overripe grapes, and banana stewed in dark, brown sugar. As the beer settles, this opens up into a beautiful mix of both dark and light fruits - plums, figs, rummy raisins, orange peel, apple skin, cherries, pears.    Complexity is only furthered on the tongue - that sweet, boozy fruit being chased by peppered toffee, clove, powdered sugar, and coriander seed. A bite of crisp, yeasty breadiness rounds everything off wonderfully.     Truly a mammoth beer. After finishing my glass, a satyr snatched up the empty bottle and pranced away into the forest. He was carrying a gold cauldron of effervescent, purple liquid on his back, and called himself the Spirit of Good Beers' Past.

T&F: Starts of with a flavour of dark fruits,a malty feel in the background all the time, in the middle I get more of the sugary yeasty sweetness and in the finish I think the spices get a lot more room in the flavour. I get a very warming feel in the body almost right after the first sip. The aftertaste has very little bitterness,but still is lasting remarkably long and both have a sweetness and malt over it.     O: this is a amazing beer.a flavour bomb in the right words. Probably one of the best quadruples that is. I enjoyed this to the last drop.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Served in a Chimay chalice, it pours a deep, very dark brown, almost black. It forms a two finger head, brown and sudsy, with low retention. Very modest and passing lacing.    Assertive and rich bouquet.   Huge dark fruits as in dates, figs, raisins and mainly plum, overripe apple, brown sugar, caramel, fruit liquor.    Simply magnificent.  Very expressive carbonation upfront.   This is similar to Rochefort 8 in the way its alcohol is felt and the character of its balance. There is a strong liquor flavor that accompanies the rest of the flavors as a fine note, and throughout the beer some tamed bitterness is perceived at times, as a playful reminder of its masterful craft.  The flavors unveil themselves as a godly parade.   Once more, dates, figs, raisins, lots of plum and overripe apple, brown sugar, caramel, fruit liquor.  Besides the notes presented in its bouquet, there is a bevy of new flavors found while tasting it: cinnamon, wood, a tad of pepper, clove, chocolate, cajeta, toffee, slight nut, vanilla, and a floral/herbal freshness accentuated by the liquor note.   The finish is long, fresh and sweet, with a worthy complexity.   Medium to light body, velvety, high carbonation.     Incredibly complex and full of depth.  An unparalleled assertiveness and length to its overall flavor.     What a finesse.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Appearance: Pours an opaque darker burnt sienna brown. Pours with a great plume of victorian lace coloured head, dissipation is moderate, and settles into a great lace and surface froth.    Aromatics: I’ve never had a plum bread pudding before, but the first whiffs of this is exactly how I imagine it would smell. A combination of yeasty fresh bread mixed with caramelized plums/dates. There is also a dress earthy floral quality to its aroma as well.    Taste: Boom! this really packs a flavour punch. There is loads of dark fruits mingling with berries and a smooth sweetness with a bit of a spice kick to it at the end. Sugar cane sweetness and remarkably little bitterness. There is a fairly robust boozy hit like a high quality rum or bourbon at the end - not too much, just enough to take those myriad of flavours home for a cozy nightcap.    Feel: The carbonation is pretty bubbly even after sitting, that small tickle of bubbles joins a smooth chorus of dry warmth and a crisp refreshing snap to it’s medium-heavy weight body. There is a complexity to its feel that I don’t think I am experienced enough to comment on well, but if this is what real Trappists beer is all about - sign me up.    Overall: Astounding. My first Trappist (and first quad) beer and it did not disappoint in its delivery. Extremely well put together, super complex but has all the selling points of a beer that truly stands out and sets a lofty benchmark that I am sure will undoubtedly be tough to compare as I look forward to my next Trappist and Quad for that matter.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Pours a dark muddy mahogany with a tan head.     Smells of raisin, plumb, fig, whole grain bread, and some sour yeast.    Taste is rich and complex with a mountain of malt and yeast. It has rich flavors of dark fruit -plumb, fig, and elderberry - with bright carbonated notes of raspberry and sour apple. There is a constant malt presence that melds with all the flavors though caramel and molasses come through. It finishes dry like a fine wine leaving the multitude of flavors rolling around your mouth.

Massive head that does not care to recede; having a light tan tint. Opaque.    Smell- Honey like sweetness with dark fruit aromas of fig and raisins. Sweet ripe cherry fragrance underlying as well.     Taste- Starts off quite mellow with a subtle and delicate sweetness, slowly picking up to a more rounding darker fruit taste. Prune and raisin fruit notes are most prominent. Hints of cherry add a slightly bit more off sweetness. Hints of vanilla help to round out any excess of sugar. Beer finishes smooth, with a bit of medicinal flavor, although still maintaining those fruit notes.    Mouthfeel- Heavy in body with active carbonation. Some alcohol burn.    Overall- An outstanding quad to be had! Possibly the best for the style. Complex, smooth, and filled with flavor, although not in excess of any one flavor. A beer to sip and enjoy for a fine occasion or celebration.

An amazing, complex, special beer.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Picked up a single 11.2 oz bottle at the Trig's Cellar 70 in Wausau. The bottling stamp states this one is good for another three or so years. Poured at cellar temperature into a tulip glass.    L: Pours a cola brown color with about two inches of light, frothy, khaki head that dissipates fairly quickly, leaving a faint film and ring that leaves mild lacing on the glass. Profuse visible carbonation at the edges where the light strikes through. A bit disconcerting is the fact that there was a substantial yeast sediment along the side of the bottle. Hoping that this one isn't infected.    S: I'm getting something of a red wine quality from the bouquet--there's a very slight sourness or vinegar that I'm hoping doesn't signify infection. There are some roasty and caramel malt notes coming across, along with a touch of clove and licorice. Raisin, plum, and warm alcohol are also present. Though I was expecting some of those banana bread Belgian yeast notes, I didn't really get any.    T: The moment of truth: did I buy an infected bottle, or not? Well, if this is infected, I'd take an infected one every time. Warm, rich flavors of roasty and caramel malts play against flavors of ripe plum and rum raisin. As the flavor moves to the middle, there is a growing banana bread and clove taste characteristic of the style: it's by no means overpowering, as it rubs up against the other rich malt and fruit flavors present. There is a touch of a red wine quality that develops in the middle and toward the back, though this is fairly indistinguishable from warming alcohol notes. The back end continues the deft balance of hops/malts/yeast, with the warming alcohol becoming more prominent but by no means distracting. In fact, it is remarkable how well this one conceals that high ABV. The spiciness (most clearly clove) culminates toward the close, with more of that banana, raisin, and plum being carried atop the malts.    F: Medium to full-bodied, this one has a really spectacular feel that sets it apart from similar beers. While this beer should feel heavy, syrupy, and boozy, it has a very light feel on the palate, aided in large part by an excellent level of carbonation. Again, you can feel the heft of this beer, but it glides beautifully through the palate.    O: I tried this one many years ago, at a time when I didn't appreciate Belgian quads, let alone most hoppy beers. I'm glad that I returned to it because it really is a special beer. I like to throw around the terms "complexity" and "balance," but this one truly delivers in those areas. The flavors are big without overwhelming or drowning out one another. And the feel on this one really is incredible. Impressive, to say the least, how well they hide that ABV: It gives you all the warmth without those sharp alcohol notes. This is a beer that is well-worth seeking out.

Appearance: A two finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer. It is a dark crimson color with no vision of anything. Looks like any other quad I've had before.    Smell: Caramel, toffee, toasted, candy sugar, spicy Belgian yeast, figs, bananas, raisins, plums, dates, and nice warm alcohol.    Taste: Anything I picked up in the aroma is the same with my palate. Tasty, delicious, nice warm alcohol, and slight bitterness. Dangerous too at 11.3% alcohol. Definitely took my time and let it warm up to enjoy those bold flavors.    Mouthfeel: Smooth, warm boozy alcohol, a little sweet, a bit dry, light light bitterness, definitely a sipper, medium to full bodied but feels light, and medium carbonation.    Overall: One of the best quads I've had and easily available at most stores. Just surprised I never reviewed it, but saved it for another reviewing milestone. I look forward to many more bottles of this in in the future. Aged well after the last 2+ years too.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 I have been “aging” this guy for about 6 months (maybe the longest I have ever kept a beer) because I was too lazy to buy the proper glass to drink it out of and I was saving it for a special occasion. Now that I finally bought the proper glass let’s see if it lives up to the hype. This Belgian quad pours a dark brown color with a big frothy tan head. The smell is complex with some significant aromas of dark fruits and sugar with a hint of alcohol. The taste is also quite complex. There is quite a bit of plum, dates, burnt sugar, molasses, and a significant alcohol kick at the end, which isn’t surprising given that the beer is 11.3%. The body is pretty heavy. Still markedly less than a typical stout or porter, but heavier than most anything else. The spices are more toned down than others I’ve had of this style. Rather than ruin the beer, like it would for a less bold beer, the alcohol flavor actually enhances it and makes you feel like you are drinking some kind magical beer / fine liquor hybrid. Plus it has a very nice warming effect. This is a fantastic beer and really in a style that I appreciate. To me this definitely lives up to the hype.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Re-review.    Pours a cloudy dark brown color. The head is around three fingers high and lighter khaki in shade. It features a bubbly texture typical of a good Belgian...as well as the underwhelming duration of retention. Small patches of lacing stick to the glass.    This has a wonderfully malty smell. Malty, but NOT overbearingly sweet. There's a wonderful candied sugar note fluttering around, giving great nuance to the additional notes of pumpernickel bread, brown sugar, plums, apricots, peaches, cherries, and dark chocolate. It's a hair hoppier than other big-name quads, but it adds wonderful dimensions of tobacco and grass instead of an overbearing, imbalanced bite. Even my words utterly fail at describing just how complex this beer is, except they just did right now. Even better, the depth is delicate and perfectly balanced instead of scattershot.    It's every bit as complex as the aroma indicated. Some intense fruity notes open it up - lighter and stone fruits hit immediately (apples, pears, peaches, apricots), which then trail off into dark fruits around the middle (plums, raisins, figs). A heavy malt presence also fills out the mid-taste with some pumpernickel bread, candied sugar, salted caramel, and toffee. It ends with a one-two punch of light tobacco and a bit of booze. This is a fresher bottle than the one I initially reviewed - as such, both the hops and the alcohol are more assertive here. Nor is it as perfectly integrated as said older bottle. It's still wonderfully balanced considering how intense everything is.    The mouthfeel is very well carbonated, helping to fill the mouth with a dense chewiness. Despite the big feel, and the malty sweetness, it's almost as dry as a 6% Belgian blonde. That's the masterstroke of this beer. There's enough carbonation and enough hoppiness to cleanse the palate beautifully.    In my head, when Motorhead wrote "The King of Kings", they wrote it for this beer instead of Triple H. Make no mistake, this beer is a damn near 5/5 with a little bit of age on it.    4.56/5: Amazing fresh, yet there's even more room for improvement aged

Appearance: Pours a huge frothy head of about two and a half fingers. Khaki colored and lively atop a very dark walnut body with shines ruby when held up to the light. Maintains a nice cap throughout. The Oerbier man on the glass seems happy.     Aroma: Stone fruit, rosey peppery yeast, molasses, and candi sugar. Textbook example. Layers of malty, Trappist yeast goodness.     Taste: Hearty Christmas desert is the first thing that comes to mind here. Candi sugar sweetness, light perfumy alcohol, rosey peppery yeast, plum/fig, dark bread, and molasses. What separates this from the number 8 right off the bat is significantly maltier taste.     Mf: Full body with prickly but low carbonation. Sweet and sticky with a warming feel (but not boozy). A sipper, but one that you want to keep sipping.     Overall: A textbook example of the style and obviously a great beer overall. Signature rosey peppery yeast, candi sugar, dark bread maltiness and stone fruit sweetness. Not too sweet, very easy drinking for what it is, really. Always worth revisiting and definitely worth trying if you’ve never had it.

Aroma of dark yeasty bread, toffee, caramelized sugar, clove like spices and dark Bordeaux cherries.    Taste displays World Class complexity and sophistication. A wonderful melange of flavors just like it smells but these flavors intermingle so well as soon as you recognize one you're tasting another. How is this possible? It's like all the colors of the rainbow were blended into one yet still remained distinct.     Full texture with balancing carbonation.    Simply one of the best of the Belgian Quads which as a group are among Beer Royalty.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Rochefort 10 cellared 3 years    Pours a dark brown color with a fluffy, fizzy, two finger sized head.    Fantastic aromas of ripe sour cherries among rock sugar and roasted malts, very intense on the nose. Almost a little boozy, but amazingly well integrated into the decadent sweet aromas, balanced by old wood and toasted walnut shell.     Has a very lively, bubbly carbonation, which makes the beer's heavy body unfold in a lighter manner on the tongue, also washing away its boozy peak, which is recognizable for just a split second, while leaving with a long lasting warmth down the throat.     Cherries from the nose are amongst the flavors from the very beginning, entangled into toffee, licorice, dried wood bark and autumn leaves. Malts have a toasty richness in this, which is heavy on the tongue, opening up the palate perfectly to the sweeter flavors, and makes it possible to integrate its warm boozy note so perfectly well. Nuttiness mingles into the warming alcohol, producing a cola sweetness, calmed by old earth and toasty malts, while finishing with a bubbly mineralic tone and dried plums.     I am blown away by this one, this tastes perfect. Love the dried, sugared, alcohol soaked cherry note, which blends into roasted, rich malts. All flavors are intense and well pronounced at the same time, creating an awesome balance, making it possible for the different components to pack such a huge punch.

S- Strong dried fruit scent, a bit tart on the nose. some spices as well.    T- Some dried dark fruit up front, raisins, figs, sweet and sour at the same time, really boozy but it doesn't dominate the palate, you can tell its high abv but subtle at the same time, crazy.     M- Medium mouthfeel, melts in your mouth, so good, remarkable!    O- Love the complexity, gets better as it warms up, just a great beer.

Not uncharacteristic for the style (in my experience) but still, not what I was expecting. Even without much of a head, this beer is still very much alive on the surface. Patches of carbonation seem to buzz around and head from the middle towards the edges of the glass. Very interesting to behold. "Legs" appear on the glass almost like that of a fine Scotch.     S- Dark, Ripe fruit and an assortment of spices. Touch of apples and a hint of dark chocolate.     T- Dark fruit and spices that fade away to a soft bitterness. Gets much more complex as it warms. What was minutes before just Dark fruit and spices turns into something that is woody and peppery. Insanely complex, absolutely beautiful.     M- Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied. Moderate carbonation.     O- I haven't had many Quads in my time but I can't imagine them being any better than Rochefort 10. Incredibly delicious while being complex enough to be very, very interesting.

Active carbonation upon pouring, that settles down. Emptied the contents of my bottle so there is a good amount of sediment floating around. 4    S: Following up a bottle of Rochefort 8. This one smells a touch sweeter and more ripened fruit. There's also more of an alcohol presence, but still not overly boozy. 4.25    T: I'm getting all of the same ripe fruit flavors, but also some more sweeter dark fruit in this one. Some fig, prune, dark raisin, and I'm not getting much of the woody/nutty undertones that I got in the 8. 4.5    M: Wonderfully creamy, yet pillowy soft mouthfeel with low carbonation. 4.75    D: This one as well is never too sweet, and never too boozy. It's insane how drinkable these Rochefort beers are. At over 11% the alcohol is hardly noticeable. Overall a highly drinkable beer with nice, sweet flavors. 4.5

(L) It is dark brown with a two inch off white head.    (A) Nice aroma of dark fruit and spices.    (T) A wonderful and complex taste of bread, caramel, raisins, dark fruit.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Pours a deep dark hazy brown with a two finger tan head that quickly dissipates. No lacing noted, but a thin tan film across the top of the beer with a thicker ring around the outside of the beer.     Smell is full of aromas of brown sugar, raisins, plums, fallen apples. Noticeable sweetness in the nose with undertones of bitter chocolate and spice.     Taste is initially marked by a prickly combination of the carbonation and alcohol. However that quickly fades to a strong malt forward flavor with notes of caramel, brown sugar, raisins, overly ripe apples. Slightly sweet, not bitterness, but its not at all cloying or too much. The aftertaste is really what makes this though. All those flavors just longer on the pallet with this pleasant spicy peppery tingle on the tongue. Although you get the boozy notes initially you quickly forget them and don't realize the cumulative effect until you notice your entire face has warmed up. This beer is perfect for a cold winter night.     Feel is surprisingly airy for the high ABV - medium carbonation gives it a crisp and light feel. However, it is in no way watery or too light, although crisp there is real depth to the feel. Very smooth, buttery and mellow.     Overall this Quad is remarkable and world class as an exemplar of the style, of Trappist beer and on its own merits. Just amazing. The balance, lush feel, and complexity of flavors, all while being so incredibly drinkable and tasty is outstanding. Must try at least once for anyone who loves beer. Couldn't have picked a better beer for my 100th review on the site.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Appearance--What one would expect from a Quad-Trappist. Murky-copper, defying light-penetration. Like other quads of this style, there is an initial two-finger head, that swiftly settles, leaving what looks like something between a glass of wine and a few fingers of liquor.    Smell--Sweet aroma of dried fruit, but not as aggressively raisin-y or fig-y as others of this style. Instead, the fruit is balanced with a mixture of anise and herb.    Taste--Initially sweet, but not cloying, and boozy, but pleasantly so. Becomes progressively more complex as it comes to temperature. Initially fruity, then a subtle and pleasant bitterness, like an unsweetened chocolate develops as it warms. Unexpectedly carbonated compared with others of this style. The carbonation helps balance the sweetness and the alcohol.     Feel--Warming, like a fine cognac or brandy. I'm trying this for the first time in the Spring. I cannot help but think that this would be the ultimate brew to enjoy on a cold, snowy night. Also holds its carbonation remarkably well, especially considering how quickly the head settled. The carbonation provides just enough "bite" to balance the malty sweetness, and leaves the brew drinkable, even as it comes up to temperature, and the sweetness and other character develops.    Overall--I am a bigger fan of the lighter fare of the Trappist realm--Orval remains a favorite. But of the Trappist Quads I have tried, this one is a clear cut above the others. These can be a little cloying on the sweetness, and a little too boozy for my palate. This one has remarkable balance, and is one of the most complex brews I've tried of any variety. Would recommend to anyone, and am looking forward to trying again.

MJ's "Great Beers" said "I became something of a devotee of Rochefort 10, specially for its bitter chocolate character.... In 2005, Rochefort 10 was deemed the best Trappist beer by the American magaizine "Mens Journal."

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 BB: 23.07.2020. DFH Tulip.    Appearance: Pours a hazy dark brown with just under 1 finger of light tan head. A little carbonation, but hard to see. Lacing was surprisingly poor, but the retention was very, very good - a pretty moderate skim of foam remained the whole way through.     Smell: Slightly sour/fruity smell; dark fruit, but tart. Cherries/raisins, backed up by a honeyed, malty sweetness. The more I smell this, the more it begins to smell like bourbon or Canadian whisky. Improves notably as it warms.    Taste: Arrives drier than the smell would suggest; slight tartness, but remarkably clean across mid-palate; no roastiness to speak of, a light maltiness, then turns to the fruit with a complex, downright winey character. That last third of the sip is where all the flavor comes, all at once - it is powerful and profound. Overpoweringly sweet, with complex layers of dried fruits, and a slightly painful sweetness. Alcohol is more noticeable than I prefer. Strangely, it improves as it warms, too.     Mouthfeel: Somehow, despite this overwhelming sweetness, it is remarkably clean and light. Ample, small-bubble carbonation. Quite clean finish. Not really bitter, but remarkably clean on the finish.     Overall: This is clearly a complex Belgian dark ale, but my heart is really not in it. It is too sweet for my taste, and between the sweetness and the alcohol, it is just really more than I can take. I love belgian dark ales, but this is overwhelming in a sense. I appreciate drinkability, and this must be a sipper. Would be better on a cool fall or winter night than a warm spring evening.

I've had many other Belgians, both domestic and genuine Belgian, including Delerium ales and ABT 12, and I have not found any that can quite knock the Ommegang 3P or Abbey from my fave list. Well, I've read about this beer, and I was skeptical, and now I have to admit defeat. This is the Belgian to judge all others by. No need to give profiles here, if you like Belgian style beers you know what to expect. Just know that the balance here is perfect on every front. A truly astonishing ale.

Aroma - Dark fruits and im talking Prune, Dates, raisins, they are all there giving it a sweet arome up front. Rich toffee follows this giving a nice bittersweet smell , Roasted nutty malts and than belgian yeast giving off that beautiful fresh bread aroma. This is a beautiful smelling beer forsure!    Taste - This is probably the first 5 I have ever given for taste but wow it kicks your palate. All the dark fruits hit your tongue first delivering a sweetness almost unheard of in beer. followed by some roasted almost burnt nuts and toffee to balance that, then you get hit with a boozyness followed by some nice fresh bread to wash it down. This is delicious!    Feel - This is a medium bodied beer with the percentage I almost expected it to be thicker. The carbonation is creamy creating a very smooth drinking experience for 11.3%.    Overall - This beer along with its price point is not a beer to be drank daily. Its going to beat you up a little with flavor and high abv% and after one your probably going to be close to finished for the day. With that said the aroma's and flavor and appearance mesh so well it will be an unforgettable experience. Get your hands on this one!

Taste is good and rich. Subtle citrus notes that Belgians are so good at, roasted malt,     Mouth is rough at times, but palatable.     An impressive, strong lil beer. Sip with catechisms.

Beer pours rich brown in color and nearly opaque, while forming an enormous chestnut head. Aroma is rich and of dried fruit, raisins. Flavor matches, bringing tremendous depth and richness of flavor, combined with impeccable balance and ultrafine carbonation. Toffee, fruitcake, and a very slight tart note which doesn't bring any offense at all. Not the most complex of the great Belgian quads, but this beer is just really easy on the senses, one might say.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Deep brown/mohogany hue. Small head with little lace. Hardly any light penetration save for a light glow at the bottom of the glass.    Dark fruits are prominent on the nose with some brown sugar and very light roast and malt sweetness. Actually very subtle. Taste turns the tables and hits with a plethora of flavour. Plum, raisin, fig, cherry, grilled peach, bubble gum, banana, caramel, toffee, tree bark, earth, oatmeal, roasted barley, Graham cracker, pop tarts, baked bread, tobacco, nutmeg, clove and a definitive brown sugar presence. Complex, thick, decent carbonation and slightly chewy. Alcohol presence is hidden very well by all of the flavours going on here and finishes out clean and easy drinking. This one deserves a proper meal pairing. Beyond fantastic and fitting of it's rating.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Look: It is a dark brown with some hazing. The head has a mousy look to it in a tan color.     Smell: Strong fruit ester aromas that feature cherries and plums that features a bready malt and spices. There are also perfume aromas as it warms.     Taste: The taste features bready and toasty malts with cherries and plums. There is a vinous quality to it and strong alcohol, but it is not hot. It is mostly sweet with a slight bitterness that creeps in towards the finish.     Feel: It has a moderate feel to it. It finishes very dry with alcohol warming.    Overall: This is a beer that has a complex balance between the malts and fruity esters. The aromas are among the best that I've rated. It is strong in alcohol that is noticeable, but not over done or hot.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 First time trying a trappist beer. This beer pours an opaque dark brown with lots of sediment at the bottom. The head is huge, fluffy, tan and sticks around for a while. There is no visible lacing. Smell is very complex, sweetness and dark fruits, mostly plum and raisins, with what smells like a slight tartness. Taste is similar, but the sweetness takes center stage and there is no hint of tartness. Feel is medium heavy, but very very smooth. Overall a great beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Rochefort 10 is my favorite beer so far, although there are other highly rated quadruples that I have not tried.  The first time I tried this beer was in Brussels at a random pub, without knowing it's fame and popularity. I'm relatively new in the "beer world" :P But I loved this beer instantly.     Rich flavour with many layers. Quity fruity but still greatly balanced. Despite the high ABV it's still very smooth.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Deep broken colour with a decent head. Smell is more subtle than I thought it would be.

Extremely foamy head, I was worried this was infected but fortunately it was not. Smells mostly of alcohol. Tastes of raisens and grain alcohol and has a ridiculously dry mouthfeel.     Overall not bad. I greatly prefer St. Bern 12 though and have yet to try westy.

Are they saving money on a designer or are they putting 100% of their focus on their beer..?    Deep, black, head remains after pouring...    Best drank after at least half an hour outside the fridge.    Aroma is too malty and sugary, not the best.    This is one of the biggest and most courageous beer I have tried, in terms of flavour. It has so many levels, every sip is different. Despite its strength, still it has a smoothness that controls all of its personality. This is amazing beer. Will def try the other numbers also. Though a bit too much of a sugary overtone. And too chocolatey.    Tastes of mocha, cocoa beans, coriander.    Look, aroma, feel...really they are similar to others. The taste is what makes this shine.     I massively respect the people who made this. They do not care about marketing. Just their actual product, in its essence. Respect. I am happy to have discovered this. Thank you to everyone who made this...

A - Poured a dense, dark brown, with a one finger tan head that moves to a thin lace within a few minutes. Very active sounding at the pour. Visible sediment at the bottom.     S - Bananas, dark fruit (cherry/fig), bread, some cider notes and slight heat.     T - Interesting. Caramel, general quadness/bread, cherry, a little bit of burn.     M - Very active carbonation happening in the mouth. Would say its medium high. The heft is full, but not overbearing. Finishes dry.     O - I don't visit this style often enough, but this is one is a great offering that's worth a try, even if it is a little pricey.

It isn't hard to see why this is considered a world class beer. Simply delicious.

After 5 minutes, yeast fell to bottom of glass.     Beer was dark brown and lightly carbonated. Could taste the alcohol in first sip, but it all went down very easy after that.     Tasted of caramel and lightly reminiscent of nutty chocolate.     This is definitely "top shelf" beer that I'll truly enjoy once in a while, but it won't go into the regular rotation.

Heat from the alcohol amplifies the spicy notes. Alcohol taste is there but subdued well by the sweetness. Fairly sweet, but not overwhelming at all. Perfect balance.  Feel: Medium/heavy body, creamy, smooth, just the right amount of carbonation.    Overall an outstanding beer. The more Belgian ales I drink, the more I like them. There's more spiciness here than I've found in other of similar styles.

Smell is holiday spices, right dark fruits, sweet dessert breads, dates, figs. Taste is similar to the aromas, rich, dark sugary notes, figs, dates, fruitcake, dark sweet bran cereals, molasses cookies, dark fruit, sorghum, anchored down by a nice pumpernickel bready maltiness. Feel is super smooth, and dense. a bit syrupy, but allows all of the flavors to coat the palate. Great dark Trappist offering for sure. A winter sipper.

Poured from bottle a dark, cloudy brown with dark yeast sediment taking a seat on top f the pillowy head, which it rode all the way down... Foamy light khaki head is very lively and has a layer persists to the end. Tons of carbonation, a gentle rock of the glass invokes a fresh layer of bubbles.    Smells very similar to the Rochefort 8, mostly of yeast and kind of soapy; I probably should have let these bottles settle out more before opening because there was a lot of stirred up yeast to contend with. Other smells are very sweet and mixed fruits. Taste is very sweet and full of fruits. Medium to full body and just a hint of booze at the end, a nice amount. Long finish with sweet tastes of cherry, raisins, and candy and maybe tobacco.    Overall, I'm drinking this side by side with the Rochefort 8, and while both are excellent and drink very smooth while hiding their abv, the 10 is just has more going on. Its really delicious and has a few more layers to it than its little brother.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured into tulip glass. It pours a dark mahogany and is opaque when the glass is held up to the sun. It has a thick, creamy, one-finger ecru-colored head and lacing. The smell is more subdued than I anticipated. It's earthy, with some faint fruitiness and a touch of spice. The taste features banana, current, cherry, tobacco, and other dark fruit, with a smoky peat, and some caramel. It is an amazingly complex and pleasurable flavor. This ale is medium-bodied, highly-carbonated, and the 11.3% ABV is not that noticeable but really sneaks up on you. Overall, this it a very well-crafted and delicious Quad. This is one of my favorite beer styles and Trappistes Rochefort 10 is clearly world class.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Trappistes Rochefort 10, Belgian Quad ale. 11.3% ABV.    A: Over three fingers of head, to start with; tan. Gotta let this settle... Dark, tamarind/brown in the glass. Honey brown-yellow in the dimple. Rather faint, yet sticky sheeting. Okay lacing.    S: Earthy, with a note of dirt. A fairly strong, sweet tree sap/molasses aroma immediately behind that; with a slight earthy sourness to it. Aroma doesn't stick around for very long, though.    T/MF: Flavor is straight up earth; and fairly bitter, at that. Very dry, considering the aroma. There is a note of tree sap. Slight lime pith. With a bright flare at the end. Seems more of a pairing beer than a stand alone. A shame; I've heard people speak really highly of it. It's not bad, but certainly not worth $7 for a little bottle.    Poured from an 11.2 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Trappist Rochefort 10 with 1 year of age    Pours a dark honey color with tons of floaties; 2 fingers of an off-white colored head. Only small shimmers of light pass through the beer. Great lacing.    Aroma brings dark fruits, light clove, a bit of banana, Belgian yeast, brown sugar, cherries, and a bit of citrus.     Taste is brighter than expected. Citrusy; crisp carbonation, banana, a tad bit watery, slight clove spice. Alcohol becomes more present as it warms.       Trappist Rochefort with 2.5 years of age    Aroma brings cherries, apple juice, dark fruits, citrus, yeast, and rum.     Much more citrus on the flavor than on the 1 year. Definitely a bit of funk, more carbonation. More alcohol is present on the taste than the 1 year; even a bit of bitterness is noted. Less balanced. I believe this beer peaks at 1 year.    Overall, this is a great, classic Belgian style Quad. It is definitely more citrus forward than expected. The crisp carbonation in combination with this brightness creates something incredibly drinkable, despite the high ABV. I see this pairing well with cherries jubilee. It gets a 91/100.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 330 mL bottle from the LCBO; "best before" Sept 22 2020 and served lightly chilled. Not the first time I've had this one.    Pours a muddy, burgundy-brown colour with reddish highlights, crowned with one finger of foamy, creamy-looking light beige-coloured head. Good retention; it persists at the surface for more than 10 minutes, receding unevenly into a lumpy cap and frothy collar, and simultaneously producing plenty of attractive lace. The aroma is similar to that of Rochefort 8, but with more of a focus on dark fruit. Big notes of plum, raisin, cherry and currant leap out on the nose, in addition to some pronounced caramelized/candi sugar sweetness. Hints of orangepeel and flowers also come to mind, with yeasty notes of banana and clove becoming more noticeable as the glass warms.    While all quality quads will provide a certain level of intensity, this one just does not relent - from the start of the sip until well after you've gulped it down. Saccharine flavours of candi syrup and molasses serve as the background, with those dark fruit notes I picked up on the nose dominating initially. Flavours of cherry, sugarplum, currant and date are each detectable, with a fairly significant hint of banana in there, too. The flavour becomes more herbal and earthy on the back end, with touches of licorice, clove and yeast rounding the profile out. Sweet-ish aftertaste with some alcohol warming, but the booze integrates beautifully. Full-bodied, with moderate carbonation levels that start off fairly assertive, but drop off over time, developing a much softer, smooth mouthfeel once it has had time to breathe.     Final Grade: 4.7, a superlative A+. Rochefort 10 is one case where the hype is completely justified - as far as strong, Belgian-style dark ales go, this one is the cream of the crop. It is a decadently tasty quad that should be considered an absolute must-try for all serious beer geeks - one bottle will not be enough. While Rochefort 8 has been available year-round in this province for a few years now, I'm still keeping my fingers crossed that this beauty will some day be equally easy to find at the LCBO.

First time i tried it was actually an accident. Arguably the best beer i have ever had. If you have this beer available and don't purchase it you are doing yourself a dis-service.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I drank this alongside an Abt 12, an experience I highly recommend other Belgian quad fans partake in. The aroma difference with St Bernardus is pretty surprising. Much more of a contrast than I would have guessed before I tried it myself.     Massive, rocky tan head on this one, tiny bubbles that lace somewhat but not in an appreciable way. Earthy aroma, herbal and almost floral at times. I get some licorice in the flavor and some cherry notes in the bouquet. I don't know if the differences I detect in this beer as compared to Abt 12 are the result of yeast esters or hops, but I'm guessing this is a yeast byproduct. Amazingly complex beer that is actually a little lighter on the palate than Abt 12. But don't be confused about where this sits. It's a big substantial 11.2% Belgian quad and should be handled as such. World class beer.
