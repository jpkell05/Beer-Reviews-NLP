look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12oz can into a goblet. canned 11/8/18, so 6 weeks old.     Dull hazy orange body. Small white head leaving excellent lacing.    Strong hop aroma here.     Hoppy, VERY dank, somewhat bitter. No other flavors. The 10.0 abv is nigh undetectable, so drinker beware.     Mouth close to full and bitey. Finish bitter.    Overall, I've been looking to try a fresh one of these for some time, since in this part of PA, the shelves only have 4-8 month old Maharaja. Must admit to being slightly disappointed by this beer. Not bad in any way, and dank is certainly not my preferred IPA flavor profile. The beer just didn't grab me the way I hoped.

Dark and heavy, but not dank, slightly syrupy, but not sickeningly sweet. Amazing hops! Very well balanced.    I first tried this at Avery's taproom in Boulder a few beers... years ago. My wife and I sampled at least half of the available beers that day, so at least a dozen of the 20+ beers on tap. This one stood out in to both of us as being the most perfectly balanced offering they had. Even the tap master (bartenders are for mixing sissy drinks in bars, this was a Tap Room) said this was one of his absolute favorites.     If you like DIPAs or Imperial IPAs, find some of this and try it. You will most likely love it.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 This is an Imperial IPA and taste likes and imperial or DIPA. I found a can in my local supermarket and had to try based on the reviews. This was a nice smooth beer for a 10%. It is malty and has a bit of an alcohol taste. It has a slight citrus scent and I can feel it on the tongue but then lose it. Surprising to find this in cans. Glad I tried it.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 In a 12 oz. can. Juicy and sweet, not a hop bomb. Deep orange. Lots of sediment in the last few sips. Solid IPA in the recent category of sweet and juicy hop profile trending away from resiny bitterness.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 On tap at Crimson in York PA. Nice clear orange-amber color with a persistent off-white head. Initial impression is a smooth, malty, fruity citrus bomb. Mouthfeel is medium tending toward sticky. Carbonation is on the light side. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. Finish is more malty than fruity, although there is a lingering citrus aftertaste.   Excellent IPA. Not for the faint of heart.

I've had it many times in the past, and each time I have it I think about how I really have to seek it out more often. Look: classic light golden semi opaque west coast IPA look. Smell:. Exactly what you would expect from a juicy and fruity hoppy beer. Taste: delicious. How well of a job they do hiding the high abv is very commendable. Taste upfront of nondescript fruits (citrus, a bit of peach) and a touch of pine. Nice dry finish that makes you want more. Feel: standard IPA mouth feel. I tend to care about the mouth feel more for stouts than iPas, so as long as it's not too thin tasting it's all good in my book. Highly recommend!

T: sweet, malty, grapefruit peel and pine arrival. Sweet citrusy malt and resin middle. Extremely piney on the finish.    M: kind of heavy-to-midweight low carb. Relatively clean, not terribly slick but low carb makes it feel not refreshing.    O: reminds me of a less sweet less carbonated six point resin. Limiting my weekly beer consumption this one feels like a waste.

At first taste I though this beer would be too sweet and overpowering in flavor to want to finish but I was wrong. I now want to lower the abv so that I can sessions this wonderful brew. I will look for this beer again.

This is a pricey beer at $4.99 for a 12 ounce can. Wow! really well made IPA. That 10% ABV is undetectable. Well balanced & flavorful. Just when you thought you might not be a west coast IPA fan you should give this one a chance.This is nne of the originators in the west coast style IPA. This beer deserves to be titled the Maharaja. Commonly, I don't this give this style of beer a world class rating, but I think this one deserves it. I can see myself having some bud with this & I don't mean bud light folks. This is one of the best IPA's that I have had the pleasure of drinking. Cheers! A-

Double dry hopping and leaving the malts lighter and adding oats and flour would come much later. It's weird to say that a 10+ year old beer is a bit of a relic but I think in the insanely trendy and dynamic craft beer world it is a bit true. This DIPA was no doubt a king for its time but has now been usurped by more agile and younger DIPAs looking to make their claim.     Drink this in the cooler days of fall and think of the craft movement from years back with rose colored glasses, if necessary.

T: Sweet caramel, toffee, and malt lead the way with a strong hit of sweet citrus fruit at the end. A resiny piney bitterness, at the end but not overly strong for a DIPA, booze is pretty well hidden.    F: Pretty thick body, with creamy carbonation    O: Not a bad DIPA, but it is a little too sweet and malty for my liking.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A - Dark orange, mostly clear slightly hazy body, thin off white head, lots of fine dot lacing.    S - Pine, resin, orange zest, a hint of vanilla, a bit of malty dough.    T - Lovely open of bubble gum, with hop notes of orange zest, pith, and mint, a middle reveals a nice malt core, delivering a dinner roll hit, slight buttery note, but nothing offensive, and a bitter but not harsh close. Delicious.    M - Sticky open, brisk middle, dry close. Alcohol is well cloaked, and this is superbly drinkable for the ABV and heavy hopping.    O - Superb. A big, bold, full IPA experience, with a big malt core. Not a boozy mess, this is a refined, carefully constructed beer that delivers on all fronts. Impressive.

One finger head that dissipates fairly quickly but leave a heavy rim with beautiful lacing. This brew is spicy on the nose with hints of fruit and pineapple. The taste pretty well follows the nose. Surprising smooth flavor for an Imperial IPA. Boat loads of hops followed quickly by tons of malt. Great combo. Not at all boozy considering its high ABV. A little ripe grapefruit along with pineapple hops to even things out. A great IPA. Some as good but few are better.

The aroma is malty resinous caramel bitterness; the taste is bitter yet sweet at different times just like "old DIPA’s" tend to get, still comes through in a good way, nothing bad, sticky resinous aftertaste; dry sticky finish; on the palate it sits fairly well and has a nice smoothness to it (I did get an old bottle); overall, this is a good DIPA for the most part.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours a beautiful West Coast sunset with a long lasting beige head.  There are so many more aromas in this IPA its hard to identify each single element. I get the typical resind, grapefruit pine scent, but I am also getting a layer of wet leaves, not in a bad way though.  The first taste was a bit too much for me. Guess I wasnt ready for the fullness along with the Rich flavors and still drinkable at a high IBU rate.  The second and third tastes were MUCH better. I like the fullness of this beer. Almost like a barley wine. But still that aroma is still a bit intense. The actual taste is not as strong as the aroma.   This is one to share with some good beer buddies

I think I had it once but not in a setting to do a review. Anyway. thanks y. bro for this fine sample.  A boy beer out of a can. Who knew? Pours heavy with a huge head and dark syrupy gold. The head stays around for the whole drink with a tan show of sticky foamy goodness. Tops off with tons of hops. Heavy hop liqueur aroma that pushes limits without passing to the excess stage.   Drinks big and full as well but what a drink. Rich malt dances with the fullness of the hops. Bitter, but not really with sweetness of the malt and heaviness of the feels keeping everything in check. I like the raw, almost rustic taste of the hops.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 (12 oz can, canned on 01/03/2017, poured into a teku - NOTE: this, I'm almost 99% positive of, has been sitting in the fridge of the store from which it I purchased for a few months now - it's been chillin long time)    L: deep almost red-orange colored liquid - looks clear, but appears to have mild haze... creamy, rocky sponge of aged-white foam, recedes into a chunky collar... collar eventually thins to little, not much lace - foam was pretty while it lasted    S: dense orange-grapefruit hops, bit of syrupy thread through the middle... gets more intensely fruity with successive sniffs - melange of tropical highlights, candy- or smoothie-like... for this abv, not an intense, raw alcohol presence, perhaps maybe some spicy esters (though that could be the hops) - it does creep out little by little... the fruity hops are the screaming centerpiece, though certainly a brawny malt lurks below    T: first sip - coursing through the middle of the palate, a very interesting, rather intense floral-herbal note, blended with or rather boosted by a soft, round, yet forceful slug of ethanol... lovely, mostly-dry finish and long-lasting, quite wonderfully ever-present tannic and biting bitterness... malt takes a bit to emerge, but it's actually nearly as densely-packed as the hops    F: smooth, lightly bouncy, somewhat surprisingly light(er) body with a marginally-oily viscosity... a surging-ly warm, yet relatively bone-dry finish that drops off mid-sip - any resinous bulge remains up front    O: well-executed brew, superb slow sipper... nice balance of sweet and dry, stalwart bitterness, strong yet so easy-drinking... a lot to like, the other 3 cans I will savor

I didn't get the dankness mentioned so a few times below in the reviews. Dark colored beer with some alcohol smells. I got a lot more malt then hops. In my opinion this beer is not worthy of the high reviews.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a 12oz can into a tulip, pours an amber/gold with an inch and a half of off white head that fades slowly and leaves ample lacing. Smell is of pine, citrus zest, and huge loads of typical American hop character. Taste follows, but is huge! Hops, and lots of them, give you s nice forceful smack in the face, but in the middle, there is a soft sweet malt character, which then fades to dank, resinous hoppy character. That taste lingers long into the finish. Feel is medium to full in body with lively carbonation. Overall, I'm all about this. Super hop forward, but just enough malt to give it balance and harmony, but not without distracting too much from the boat loads of dank hop flavors.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 $ 15.00 (Including tax)/four pack ($ 0.3125/oz) at Franklin Beer, Franklin, PA.  Canned on 03/07/17. Stored and served at 42 degrees into a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.  Aroma – Citrus and flowers, some pine.  Head – large (Maximum 7.3 cm, aggressive pour), off white, creamy and dense, good retention, diminishing to a thick seven mm ring and heaped rocky partial layer. At this point, the receding head has left thick rings of excellent lacing.  Lacing – excellent. Thick complete rings of tiny to small bubbles: rings are connected by thin tiny columns.  Body – dark orange, hazy but it could be chill haze. It isn’t going to last long enough to warm up in the glass.  Flavor – Begins with a dank hoppiness which contrasts with the original aroma. Warming in my mouth accentuates the dankness as well as bringing out some malt. No alcohol, no diacetyl.  Palate – medium, slightly oily, lively carbonation.     An excellent DIPA and lawnmower beer. If I had another four-pack, I’d mow the lawn again just so I could drink this after.    Appearance 4.5, Aroma 4.25, Flavor 4.5, Palate 4, Overall 4.25.

A strong, bitter, citrus splash with an undercurrent of pine, fruit, and ethanol-filled caramel. A smooth, almost imperceptible burn throughout, obviously from the high ABV> One of the best IPA's I've had.

The head did leave some lacing on the glass as the head dissipated. The carbonation that existed was a bubble here and a bubble there.   Piney, resin, citrus (grapefruit, orange), floral, touch of herbal, caramel, and a toasted bread note.   Tons of pine flavor, citrus (grapefruit, orange, lemons), floral, touch of herbal, caramel, toasted bready malt flavor, and subtle sweetness.   A big full body beer, slightly chewy, medium carbonation, medium plus carbonation, and a full finish.   Maybe I am used to the ripping effect of brash hops profile, but to me this beer had a heavy malt backbone and the hops was just laced in between. A touch bigger hop profile would make this an awesome DIPA

Medium to high bitterness but smooth for 10% ABV. Big, almost creamy, with dank, oily hops, orange rind, fermented honey, and potpourri. The malt character is almost raisin-y mid-palate.    Mouthfeel is medium to full.    Overall, this is a good DIPA but a touch rough around the edges.

Aroma is a bouquet of hops loaded with strong citrus notes of grapefruit and tangerine. Crystallized honey and caramel malts help to balance. Flavor rips your pallet with dank and citrusy hops that are also very bitter and piney. The sweeter malts help ease all the bitterness with caramel and honey notes. Feel is medium with nice carbonation. Sticky feel that finishes nice and dry. Great example of the IIPA.

As expected, the can was spot on. This is an outstanding gem from Avery. There isn't much that can be said with this amazing beer. Sweet malt, boozy alcohol, and huge hops and bitterness all at the same time! Amazing concoction ! This bad boy out shines many Imperial IPA and is a must try for those who haven't. By far on of the best out there today in a world of many choices. You can not go wrong with this gem !   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 22oz bottle with my FW brewing snifter  Had this many a times - noted on 10/17/15     The “High King”    Bright golden orange body with some partial clearing around the edges. A healthy tan khaki pillow head comes to rest over top. Nicely retaining with some persistent stick of lace. Pungent pine forest with citrus fruit zest, mild dank herbs and honey sweet malts. Alcohol spice is stingingly present in the nose. Candied grapefruit meets sappy boughs of pine and some mild herbal spice. Smacks of caramelized malts that give off a honeyed cracker flavor with some rather high levels of bittering units and lasting oily hop resins. Moderately full bodied with some syrupy moments. Just enough drying lift to save face in the finish. Some alcohol warmth that can get quite boozy at times while still maintaining its drinkability. Big in every way possible. The OG TIPA.     Respect the almighty or he will smote thee. Namaste BA!   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This one to me is a classic example of imperial IPA, and is a classic IPA in the sense of it was a bit of a trailblazing beer back when it originally came out and blew peoples minds as a big hop bomb. Now there are tons of examples along the same vein. Still, it is delicious nonetheless, and love the new canned format that came out late 2016. getting it fresh is really awesome too.     L: Pours a dark gold with slight amber highlights suggesting heavy use of caramel or specialty malt. Nice carbonation and billowy white head. Slight haze and hop sediment in glass.     S: Large burst of tropical and resinous aroma. Wonderful dry hopping here. The full gammit of "C" hops appears to be used. Citrus, pine, floral, and dank all at the same time. Bit of booze in the nose as well.    T: This one is a very large and in charge beer! Your palate is overwhelmed with sweet malt, boozy alcohol, and huge hops and bitterness all at the same time! somehow it all comes together. this one is sweeter than many modern huge IPA's which I really like. The balance is awesome and it still serves to be a powerful hop bomb. You could mistake this for an extremely hoppy barleywine if you wanted to. The finish is just dry enough to keep this from being overly sweet or cloying. One of the more powerful IPA's ive had in the sense of overall flavor, hoppiness, and alcohol.    F: slick, oily, medium bodied. medium carbonation    O: This is a fun beer to drink and one I love revisiting each year. It stands out among countless other IPA's and is very unique and a classic example of what Imperial IPA is all about! Well done Avery for taking a chance on this one!

Taste: Characteristic of an imperial IPA, prominent maltiness and sweetness that leaves a sticky, boozy sensation on the palette. Hops are not the star in this imperial, but they do present their appropriate bitterness at the finish.  Feel: Quite boozy, as an imperial should be. Thick with a sticky sweetness, but not excessive by any means. This is a strong beer, both in ABV and flavor; don't down this one too quickly. Appropriate medium carbonation level.  Overall: A very solid imperial IPA. It's nice seeing an imperial that isn't afraid to make the malt a star. Not that there's anything wrong with a hop-centric imperial, but many breweries these days seem to be fixated on creating hop bombs. Maharaja is a well-balanced imperial IPA that I would definitely recommend as a premium example of the style.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This double imperial has an amber/ brown hue and not much of an aroma. Very smooth taste for a 10% ABV double imperial. Very drinkable. Hops strong but accented by malt flavor. My local tap house has it on draft served in an 8.5oz glass for $3.50 on Wednesdays. I'd definitely get it again.

White head present with a medium amount of retention. Slight lacing present on the glass. Lots of lazy bubbles rising. Aroma: Very fresh and pungent hoppy aroma immediately on the uncorking. Light and lilting citrus notes on the swirl n' sniff. I also pick up some sweet stone fruits and well...mango, apricot. Can also detect some bready malty notes on the deep inhale. Taste: Really juicy. Less citrus and more juicy stone fruit are present. Velvety smooth and not overpowering fro such a large beer. I am also getting some pepper notes towards the end. Aftertaste: Spice picks up on the back end. Smooth and velvety on the back as well. The alcohol is well hidden and only trace amount are detected. Notes: Big bold aroma. I could smell the bouquet immediately after opening the bottle. love the nose. Crazy how well the alcohol is hidden for such a high ABV. Easy drinker and could become dangerous. High IBU rating but i don't think it is overly bitter at all. Very smooth. Result/ Rating: Very Good/ 4.64

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 The beer pours a muddy amber with a medium sized well sustained head. The aroma opens with resiny, piney, forest smells, as well as some caramel, and burnt orange, and a subtle bouquet of fruits - overripe peaches, passionfruit, and guava. Pine and caramel dominate the flavor, with dark resiny, slightly dank flavors also present, and some sweet red malts. The flavor is both quite sweet and quite bitter. The mouthfeel is rich and sudsy. Overall this is a very well made, well balanced beer. Perhaps not in the center of my taste preference, but still very good.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Canning date is 3-16-16.    A - Pours a slightly hazy medium orange gold color, no floaties, anda thin, but very dense white lacing ring. Carbonation is mild, but steady.    S - Pungent pineapple rind and sticky pine, with a little bit of spiciness.    T - Follows the nose and all hops. Dominated with juicy and dank pineapple rind, some pepper spiciness, and ends with some mango sweetness with a pine bite. There's a slight hint biscuity malt but is very faint, it's all hops from start to finish. There's a very small amount of alcohol poking through.    M - Medium body, gentle carbonation.    O - The 8% in this D-IPA is extremely well hidden and there's alot of juicy hoppiness still left at six weeks out. Had this in the past but scratching my head why I never reviewed it until now.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Very sexy appearance on these, the quintessential orange ipa appearance replete with a legit 3/4" white head. Aroma super resiny, forest, citrus, grapefruit dominant, some tangerine.    Viscous for sure, plenty of malt, but the hopping still cuts the hardest here. Chewy. Lots of older hops. Columbus and Centennial I would guess make up the largest quotient. Hides alcohol well. When I've had it on tap, it has always been superior to the bottle. I love they are in cans now (or at least I heard?). Would bang again. Its from back when 100ibu was something they bragged about, but this was one of the few that wasn't just massive bitterness, it still imparted some good old school C hop vibes and tons of toasted pale malt that quelled the alcohol.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Nice copper, darker orange color with excellent retention on the glass. Tight white bubbles on the head.    Smell is very tropical, not getting much pine like some reviewers mentioned. Getting plenty of mango, papaya and melon. Some floral elements as well.    Taste follows the nose quite well with hints of tropical notes. Some pine bitterness comes through at the back end with a nice coat of hop resin and bready malt at the finish.    Mouthfeel is smooth, almost velvety.     Very enjoyable beer.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a bomber (combat) bottle into a standard English pint glass. Enjoyed at around 55 degrees, perfect for IPAs...ice cold is not the way to drink an IPA    (A)ppearance - nice clear copper color, no haze and great head retention and long lingering lace.  (S)mell - nice floral, not overpowering hoppiness with melon lingering in the noise and very pleasant  (M)outfeel - nice, full body beer, smooth and silky  (T)aste - nice, not too hoppy but a defining DIPA certainly showing Columbus or Cascade hops. Not boozy, but does sneak up on you, it got high ABV, but is not significant in the taste  (O)verall - a very nice IPA, and not the first time I have enjoyed this exceptional beverage! I tried six months ago in OK, at a local tap house on tap. Had to trend carefully as you don't notice the ABV and it will kick you after having two or more...but it goes down smooth as silk. I was thankful to find this at a whole foods in Dayton, OH as it has a hard time making it this far east! Nice!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Love the way the sweet malt taste melds with the citrus and tropical flavors of the hops. Really well built beer. 
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Pours a nice amber copper. Clear with carbonation bubbles visible. Head is nice and suds and doesn't want to dissipate. Aroma is juicy and hoppy. A hint of astringent sour rind in there, I think I'm also smelling the barley. Slightly rotting peaches.    Taste hits on the citrus hard then the malted barley. Very creamy that goes to grapefruit. Creamy malt overtakes the taste, and the citrus is more candied than real. The label claims 102 IBU but it's so very well handled I'd never guess it. It's there but only just as a nice gesture. I'm also getting pepper, as another reviewer noted.    Ends sticky and overly boozy in the taste. Doesn't handle the 10.2 ABV very well. Careful, feels boozy and sticky/sickly sweet. This DIPA feels like a Triple IPA with a little too much going on, a little on the rotted fruit side. Not for all tastes.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottle3/6/16... Little over a month old.     Look is light copper and crystal clear body, cream colored head leaves little lacing.     Smell is piney resin, with lighter citrus notes in the back. Malty aroma picks up and later dominates as the beer warms. Well balanced, with a tangy rush of grapefruit toward the close.     Taste follows smell, pine and fruity notes slightly more prominent.     Feel is excellent, very full for an IPA with lively carbonation. Chewy, sticky finish with excellent bitterness at play with the thick malts.     Overall, this is a must for anyone who likes big ipas.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Ordinarily, 102 IBUs would cause my throat to close up and my lips to seal in reaction to my tastebuds being brutalized by the assault.  The fact that I could finish this beer twice is testament to "it can't be all bad."    The first time I had it, my abbreviated notes said "NA" for "Never Again!"  But because the ale is listed on the "!001" beers, I gave it another try; but wisely ate Indian take-out while drinking Maharaja.  I'm not going to say that the pairing spared this beer from a below average rating.  But, the food unquestionably helped me finish the beer. At that level, this is a good pairing.

Pours a lovely pale brown with slight orange/red hues. Great head on the beer with a lot of foam and beautiful lacing.     Smells sweet, malty and vegetal. EXTREMELY pleasant. Nothing outstanding but just so damn calm and easy.     Taste is super pleasant stone fruit, malt, citrus and a slight bitterness from hops. Absolutely no alcohol. Can't believe this is 10%. Such a crisp and refreshing drink, so easy to sip, but a mouthful that puts some imperial stouts to shame.

This bottle of Maharaja was batch No. 20, bottled in December 2014. 22oz Bomber poured into a tulip glass.    Look: Deep orange, almost crimson color. Thin head that seems to last a while.    Smell: Tons of amazing hop aroma. Lots of grapefruit, citrus, mango, some pine, malt, and a little bit of alcohol.    Taste: Very similar to the smell. Lots of grapefruit and mango with a very nice malty finish. The perfect trade-off of sweetness and bitterness. Avery has done a great job at hiding the alcohol in this beer, but there still is a small hint of it in the back. However, the beer is very well balanced.    Feel: Relatively medium-bodied beer. Obviously, slightly thicker than most IPAs but definitely suitable for a DIPA.    Overall: A very tasty hoppy beer. Avery has done a great job with this beer and I would recommend picking this one up the next time you are looking for a great DIPA.

Since I'm a fan of ipa's on the sweeter side, this was right up my alley. The best way I can describe the taste is sweet, orange, zesty, and pungent. In my opinion the sweetness along with the pungent taste balances this beer out perfectly. I'll definitely be headed back to the store to buy a couple of more of these 22 ounce bottles to enjoy in the future.

Smell: It has pine, citrus, hints of apricot, and a slight hint of malt, caramel. It has a very sweet beginning and then the bitter kicks in. The flavors are It has a caramel base with pine and citrus hops. The citrus hops remind me of apricots.     Fell: It has a semi-dry finish. The texture is high on the moderate end. The bitter punch on the palate is long lasting after swallowing. It has a moderately high amount of carbonation..    Overall: The combination of hops and malt works well. The overall feel is a bit heavy, but quality none the less.

Had this when I went returning the rental car in downtown Boston at a stop in Bunker Hill (Brewer's Fork - awesome place).   Described the bar tender my likes and he poured me a sampler of this one, which sold me on it.  Strong citrus and grass nose, but the taste is plain fantastic joy. Flows like thick juice. Did not taste a lot of alcohol and thought it is an IPA until my buddy told me we better get going before the 10% kick in.  And they did eventually while the taste lingered....  Great.

And I know that's a bold statement. There's a lot of people willing to take the pepsi challenge in that one. It's blood orange in color with a sweet boozy floral aroma. Essentially the beer equivalent of a very rich sweet red wine.   Great nose, taste and body!   Poured into a short tulip off tap. Always good.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 This is truly a WOW brew for me!   Pours an amber and orange color with a nice frothy head and sticky lace.   Big juicy citric and tropical fruit aroma, oily hops, sweet malts and a whiff of alcohol on the back end.   What an amazing big juicy taste! Arguably perfectly balanced. Really sweet on the tongue, toasted malts and tropical fruits, yet, it is also a hop bomb. Piny, dank, oily and resinous.  Big mouthfeel but unbelievably drinkable for the high ABV. I guzzled two of them in no time!   Amongst IPAs, I've given Pliny the Elder a 5 and Heady Topper a 4.9.(Would have been a 5 for appearance if not for the can) This is right up there and pretty damn close and perhaps right at there level. I will definetely have again and reevaluate if it does indeed make that 5.

The feel is strange, smooth with a lingering creamy thickness. Overall, it's not what I expected. I was hoping for more of a juicy IPA than a sweet candied ale.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Imperial Malty Piney and Resinous Double IPA.  The best variety out there.    Served 38F in a 5 ounce brandy sinfter from the 22 ounce bottle.    The malts in this ale are very omnipresent.    It is difficult to get this portion of the brewing process correct, and Avery nailed it on this offering.     Not quite as good as Singlecut Bon Bon 2X TNT, but not far from it.     Just a really well balanced ale in every aspect.    Freshness is going to be crucial with this style of dipa, so make sure your bottles havent been exposed to sunlight or havent been laying around.     This is a limited release according the bottle so puschase accordingly.     Malty, bready, hoppy all with excellent balance and an even more enticing price point.    Really an outstanding and underrated dipa, and my first taste of Avery.    Reminds me a lot of Great Lakes Chillwave. Many similar qualities in the nose, taste and finish.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Surprisingly dark and opaque reddish brew. Solid head production and retention.    Pine and citrus hops, with grainy caramel malt, brown sugar, and touches of banana and lemon.    Sweet, big, and bold on the palate; the hops really kick in on the last third. Quite juicy. Mango, melon, banana, guava, brown sugar. Intensely sweet fruit, vice the acidic, citric fruit you expect from traditional IPAs.    Oily and syrupy on the palate. Normally, that's a detractor for a DIPA in my book, but the way this brew presents itself (think: the smaller, lighter cousin of Devil Dancer or 120 min), it's actually a very enjoyable feel. 10.2% alcohol is very smooth.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bomber, huge head that dissipates slowly leaving behind sine lacing. Pours a hazy copper color. Aroma is of some sweet malts, bready. Hops come in next, pine and some tropical fruits. Mangoes and some passion fruit. Taste is of the same, but more malt than hops. Probably my fault as I left it in the fridge too long. The hops are there though. This reminds me a lot of a hoppy barleywine with all the malts.    Good beer. Would buy again.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 A heavier malt balance with this Imperial. Not cloying, but filled with pie crust, toasted bread and caramel from the malts. Heavy American hops flavors, leaning towards dank pine. Outstanding flavor and aroma.

As with most imperials, this one has a heavy, thick malt backbone to deliver an intense citrus and pine resin flavor bomb.     This one, however is a too malty for me. I prefer malt to take the backseat to strong citrusy hops. The thickness of Maharaja is delicious, but a bit too much for me.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 2015. Pours an opaque amber. Citrus and pine dominating aromas. Tastes is somewhere right between that citrus and pine juiciness with a heavy sweetness that lingers and is almost "chewy". Great beer and great to revisit after a few years, and still keeps up with current DIPA in my opinion. Cheers!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured into oversized wine goblet. Very brown with a moderately thick and consistent foam. Nice hop and fruit flavors on nose that are counteracted with a strong malt taste. Mouth filling, slight bitterness when cold, but as it warms, becomes almost creamy. Nicely well-balanced example of my favorite type of beer. Would gladly get this one again.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A very nice malty DIPA, that has a pretty smooth finish and minimal bitter. It also hides that 10.2% ABV in a way that I can only assume is magic or sorcery of some kind. Very nice, but be careful. It will mess you up in a hurry.    Would Drink Again: Yes  Would Purchase Again: No

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3.75 22 oz bottle, June 2015 batch.    Amber-orange, with a pillowy, off-white head that leaves delicate lacing across the inside of the glass.     Smell is citrus and herbal hops alongside sweet caramel malts, with a little funkiness playing in the background.    Taste follows smell and seemingly hits the palette all at once, almost surprising in its assault of herbal, orangey, bitter hoppiness and bright, in your face, caramel sweetness. Sweetness lingers, with just a bit of bitter hop flavor in the corners of the jaw.    The viscosity of this is typical DIPA, and there isn't a lot of carbonation, barely enough to leave a prickly sensation on the tongue. However, this works in its favor, and it is way too drinkable for having a 10+ abv.    Brings to mind 471, if you are looking for a comparison. But, I feel like the flavors of 471 hit in layers, rather than all at once, right at the front.    Overall a tasty brew, but I don't know if I'll seek it out again. I'm having a hard time laying a finger on why. I guess it boils down to the abundance malty sweetness going on, and the hop profile just not sitting quite right.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 The original rating is from when I first had this beer fresh. I am now going to review this beer again with one that is 17 months old. I am not going to change the original rating as this would be unfair, just want to see how it aged..................Color seems to be unchanged but it possibly may have gotten bit darker as I do not remember the deep orange color from previous drink. Aroma is sweet malts and overripe oranges with a bit of yeast. Taste is definitely not as good as fresh as the hops have mellowed dramatically and the malts have become IPAS, even at 10%abv, but had to try..

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3.75 On tap at the brewery. Pours a nice burnt orange-yellow color. Strong malt backbone and a sweet malty finish. Lightly bitter and I wanted a little bit more to even out the malt.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a tulip.    Aroma: caramel-malt sweetness and hops. You know this will be a hop-bomb. Alcohol is noticeable.     Appearance: copper-orange and bright. No chill haze even right out of the frig. Head is 2-fingers thick and light tan that fades to a thin veil.    Flavor: caramel-sweetness dominates the aroma initially, so much so, as to suggest this beer will be cloyingly sweet. This is not the case, though. Malt Flavors are sweet biscuit/bread, which grow increasingly sweet as the beer warms. Eventually the beer becomes too sweet. Hops are certainly ever present which attempt to balance the sweetness. Nice, dank hops. The 10.2% abv is noticeable but contributes to this beer. Despite the 10%+ abv, the alcohol is not hot or over the top.     Mouthfeel: medium to med-heavy. Chewy.     Overall: this is a quality IIPA, one of the better ones widely distributed and readily available for me (Denver). Hops are at the forefront, but are balances well the with malt.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Pours a deep amber with about a finger of head that slowly dissipated and left a capping on the liquid. Decent lacing left behind as I drink it. Smells like walking through a pine forest, but the taste seems more about malt than it does hops. There's still a decent hop bitterness there, but (and especially on the first sip) there is an overriding malty sweetness. Carbonation is very low, but a burn from the ABV helps lighten it up some.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 The world of DIPA's is becoming fairly convoluted yet this still stands out as exceptional from the crowd. Fairly deep amber in color about an inch of foam and good retention. Floral hop flavors hit the nose first and leave a little room for a melony aroma to compliment a soft and well rounded pine presence. The taste is more geared towards a soft fruit touch along with a noticeable alcohol burn that takes a bit away from the taste. Not bad but I would have liked a touch more bitterness here. Smooth mouthfeel rounds out a great IIPA.    Edit. Drinking again on 5/20/16 everything still applies, but noticing a strong olive like presence in the aroma and taste.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 22 oz bottle into a teku.    Appearance: Pours a dark copper color; this is a dark DIPA. The head is a finger high and off-white in shade. I really like both the good duration and texture, as well as the huge amount of lacing that clings to the glass. (3.75)    Smell: Welp, that's certainly pungent. Lots of piny, grassy, lemony hops hit me square in the nuts (also square in the nose), and yet it's backed by a massive malt backbone. I get lots of nut, caramel, and even some leathery must (booze). Let it open up, and the hops become somewhat citrusy. This is definitely redolent of a barleywine, bringing an almost weird combo of extreme hops and extreme malts (really, though, this is nothing like Bigfoot). One of the more complex DIPAs I've sniffed, but I worry how sweet it will be. (3.5)    Taste: Tasting it, it doesn't seem as bitter as I anticipated. But those extreme malts? They're sweeter than I anticipated, as well. I can feel the hops ballasting the sugary sweetness to an extent, injecting a pleasant bitterness on the back end. To an extent. After a while, the malts smother the hops with heaping handfuls of caramel, nuts, toffee, brown sugar, and molasses. Holy balls, this is a total malt bomb - and not in the way I like. (2.5)    Mouthfeel: This is almost ridiculously heavy and sweet. Naturally, the finish is longer than War and Peace. A sipper through and through, this goes down the palate like treacle. Low carbonation doesn't help much - on the other hand, a slight alcohol prickle actually does. (3)    Overall: This one isn't for me. It's WAY too sweet for my personal tastes. Even looking beyond my own preferences, it still seems rather messy - I won't go looking for it again. Others will like this more than me, however, so I can't be too hard on it. (3)    2.97/5: The Maharaja of maltiness

The beer itself is a clear medium amber that looks pretty nice and deceptively easy to drink.     The beer smell is fantastic. The beer has a very strong bitter hop note with a stronger malt note to balance it. The malt note is pretty strong and provides a nice sweet nose to it. The sweet notes are pretty strong and work well with the hop notes. The hops notes are something to behold and vary. The notes seem to range from pungent to a nice dry-hopped pine with a bit of citrus. However, some of the notes are stronger than others. The pine notes definitely dominate the other ones.    The beer taste is definitely interesting. It's a pretty bitter beer with a nice malt taste to it. The malt isn't as strong in the taste as it is in the nose. Rather, the malt seems to exist for keeping the beer from becoming too bitter. The hops also vary from pungent to piney but the differences are a bit more noticeable. When the beer is cold, the pungent notes come out stronger, and the piney and tangy ones come out but do not completely cover the pungent taste.    The mouthfeel is fairly deceptive and good. The beer doesn't feel very heavy and has a pretty smooth finish with a little bit of thickness to it. The biting carbonation also makes it a it lighter.    Overall,a fantastic beer and worth getting when available. It's good and inexpensive. If you're a hophead, you have no excuse not to get this.

The aroma of the hops is big, with deep tropical, floral, pine, and citrus notes. The taste closely aligns with the aroma, with all three hops flavors noted but blending together against the malt bill that does just enough to keep it all together and its just that much better. The body has a nice thicker feel to, with just a little alcohol tingle and a smooth finish. AN easy to drink IIPA is a dangerous delicious thing.

I think it's only a few weeks old - I'd think that's fresh enough but maybe some of the brighter notes already faded. Still, great DIPA I'd definitely have again. It's a lot less expensive than most of their offerings which is nice too.

There is a nice, pineapple sweetness that pushes against the bitter hops and creates a truly fantastic beer.     The aroma is pure pineapple juice with some piney undertones.    The alcohol is absolutely present, but by no means overpowering. I was shocked when I saw this was 10.2% Abv. It drinks like a regular IPA. Very smooth and moderate in carbonation.     For $9 I would absolutely buy a bomber of this again.

My saliva 5 minuets after drinking this tastes better than half the beers I drink. There is a great extra long taste cycle from the first thing you taste to the last.   Maybe the best xIPA for me this year. Avery goes back to the top of the brands after the disappointing or misunderstood Kaiser release a few months ago knocked them down for me.   Thanks Avery guys. This compares to the most savory stuff I can concoct on the grill. Can't give anything a perfect cuz I know it is something still out there , ya'll are probably drinking it now.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Just like Avery says, lots of hops up front with a strong, sweet malty finish. Very balanced however. A delicious, satisfying imperial IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Appearance - 4/5  The head is frothy and semi translucent white in color, approximately two fingers thick and dissipated after a while. Nice lacing affect left behind in the glass as the beer disappears. This brew is slightly hazy and is a rich orange/ amber ray of sunshine.    Smell - 4/5  Avery’s offering is definitely a Hop-fest for the nose paired with a sweet fruity/citrus aroma. The malts and hops are ever present and in your face as the brewer intended.    Taste - 4.5/5  This DIPA incorporates smooth malt flavors with the backdrop of a perfect balance between bitterness and sweet. The Hops are true to form for a DIPA. The citrus/grapefruit flavors are distinct and help to mask the taste of alcohol.     Mouth Feel - 4/5  The Maharaja is a medium-bodied offering that is smooth, well balanced, unrestrained and very appealing to the palate. The carbonation is noticeable and tingles the tongue just the correct amount.     Overall - 4.25/5  I really enjoy American DIPA’s and look forward to trying anything in this style that is new to me. Avery has produced an excellent American Double India Pale Ale in my opinion which is worthy of the accolades it receives. The complex flavors are vivid, the alcohol is hidden well and the mouth feel is robust resulting in a solid offering from beginning to end. This brew is similar to Stone Brewery’s Ruination.

Really great, malt forward, semi-sweet DIPA that did not disappoint!

From its near Crimson hue to a perfect mouthfeel and hop/malt balance, it is as well-crafted a beer for the style on Planet Earth. Yes, I like it, especially as ridiculously fresh as it is right now.

Laces well, and there is an abundance of sediment floating around in there. The bottle has been sitting in my fridge for about 3-4 weeks. Medicinal smell, some alcohol in the nose. Taste is sweet, caramel like. This is a malty imperial IPA, alcohol is present in the taste but not overwhelming. This one is a sipper.

Slightly hazy, orange amber; good frothy head of off white foam and nice lacing. Full nose and flavor; plenty of malt body, grains and caramel without being too sweet; layers of hops - grapefruit rind, herbs, resin, tobacco, earth and slight sweeter fruit. A bit more than medium body with moderate carbonation. Balanced, full and all round enjoyable.

Medium body, slightly creamy texture, average carbonation, bitter finish with a hint of alcohol.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a Dogfish Head IPA glass.    A - 4.5 - Pours a deep caramel orange color. Massive head potential for the ABV being so high. Formed a three finger head of slightly off-white, dense head. Really awesome head retention and lacing.  S - 4.5 - Pineapple, oranges, caramel, grapefruit, hops and a light touch of malt.  T - 4.75 - Upfront there is a really unique taste that sets this one apart as a unique DIPA for me. Similar to the candy, there is a sweet-tart type tartness upfront, which fades into a light maltiness and ends on a hoppy bitter tone. Perfectly executed flavor development. The tartness upfront is very tasty, the maltiness softens the blow so to speak into the bitter, hoppy ending. Very well balanced, especially for it being an imperial.  F - 4.75 - Oily and creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied.  O - 4.5 - This is a really great imperial IPA and the tartness of the taste is something unique and will drink a little off the beaten path and be something different for the seasoned IPA drinker. Well worth trying for fans of the style and you cant beat 7 bucks for a bomber!

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours a dark orange color with a one finger foamy head. It has a deep, earthy flavor to the hops, almost like a British ipa. There is also a good amount of pineapple and mango. Green apple and a sweet, bready malt. The flavor is intensely malty, but it has enough bitterness to support it. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Overall, this is a top notch ipa, however, i would enjoy a little more intensity in the hop department.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Growler purchased from local Heinen's grocery store for $15.99/64oz.    Orange-ruby elixir into DFH chalice. One finger, slight off-white head, dissipates to rim. Thick lacing from top to bottom.    Nice aroma of tropical fruits (pineapple, mango, gf) plus some nice pine from the simcoe. There is a bit of malt biscuit which leaks through.    Smooth hop bitterness, tropical fruits, a bit more pine than the nose. The malt sweetness really comes through and knocks back the hops.    Medium to heavy body, a bit of an alcohol feel mid swallow.    Overall an above average DIPA, but no where near the big boys. Too much malt which is what Avery is shooting for, a "balanced" DIPA.

22 oz. bottle poured into a tulip.    A: Darker copper than I expected with a plenty of head and great lacing.    S: The nose is surprisingly full of sweet citrus, almost burnt, along with a nice refreshing hop character.    T: The taste is way sweeter than expected in a good way. I got a ton of green apple and almost like grilled pineapple. Hops are definitely there and do linger for a bit, but perfectly complement the sweetness.    M: The body is medium to full (for an IPA) with a decent carbonation.    O: I really liked this beer. Couldn't find it anywhere when I went to Denver, so I was surprised when BevMo in SoCal had a few. This is really a great DIPA IMHO and may be one of the easiest to drink I've ever had. I could see how some hop lovers may be left looking for more, but it was almost perfect for my palate.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Served from 22oz bottle into 16oz tulip  Release No. 22   April 2015    Two lines printed on the bottle read — "15112F5 / 1356263" so this means bottled on April 22, 2015 from brew tank F5. Reviewed fully on June 27, 2015. I've had this for about a month now and didn't realize how fresh it was. A couple months in the bottle should do this beer no injustice.    A — Poured carefully out of the bottle, as there was a bit of sediment visible near the bottom of the bottle when held up to the light. This pours a reddish, coppery amber hue in the glass. There is an initially tall, off-white colored head that settles and fades into a thin layer atop the body of the beer. Lacing left behind is supremely consistent and heavy/sticky.     S — Smells of dank, piney, resinous, hoppy fucking goodness. Very hoppy and bitter, lots of juicy Simcoe hop character, as well as a bit of Centennial spiciness and Columbus sweetness.    T — A true hop bomb, tons of bitter, piney, dank, herbaceous, resinous, peppery, earthy, herbal, slightly sweet notes. Extremely hop forward and bitter, while still having enough of a malt foundation to keep this from being excruciatingly bitter, lots of nice sweet malt characteristics, caramel specifically. Very nice balance of bitter and sweet.    M — Medium bodied, ample carbonation, seriously cannot believe that this beer is 10%+ ABV, supremely smooth and no hint of alcohol whatsoever.    O — Fantastic overall, have had this many times before on-tap, but needed to add a full review, this is a fantastic beer, perhaps a "sleeper pick" in some regards, very nice.
