look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Amber color, beige head, intense aroma of caramel, malts citrus and flowers, taste is moderate sweet, heavy bitter, medium body, soft carbonation, quite difficult to drink.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Bottled date on label is '12/14/16 2031'.  Medium amber colored body, which is cloudy. Half finger of off white head sticks around as thin cap. Leaves behind some strings and spots of lacing.  This aroma is not very attractive, but expresses dark fruit prune and raisin. Good hops back up.  Taste is dark roasted with prune and raisin, and bright hops.  Mouth feel is close to full, with dark fruit resonance. Very smooth with the dark fruit influence. Good carbonation.  Expresses as a fully thought out and developed American barleywine beer. Can be sipped or crushed both, according to   how this barleywine is experienced.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Pours a deep vibrant red/copper, nice head with great retention and lacing, color of clay.  Smell is sweat figs and apples with some sweet hop/herb notes. Cherry and caramel hits as well.  Taste is definitely hop forward, quite bitter, tastes like black tea and lightly of lemon or lime peel. some tart apple and more caramel as it warms up. Hadn't had this in years and am honestly shocked at how hoppy it is. This could pass as an imperial IPA.  Mouthfeel is a little on the lighter side. Really surprised at that, it's not watery but it is definitely not dominant or really filling.  Overall this is a really nice english imperial IPA? The most American of American barleywines I suppose. It is assertively hoppy and surprisingly light bodied. Not really what I want when I want barleywine but a nice beer none the less.

A very enjoyable beer!

Poured into a large goblet produced a smaller than expected head over a clear dark brown amber body. Smell is of piney citrusy toffee. Taste was surprisingly not the hop monster I was expecting; don't get me wrong, there was plenty of bitterness but already complex dark sweet flavors underneath with very little overt alcohol. Mouthfeel was particularly bitter on the back end.    2/17/2019 After my 2/4 initial plunge with a 2019, which was at my daughter's and son in law's place in Santa Cruz, I decided when I returned to chez Hate to pop one of the 2018s (bottled 12/01/2017) as a basis of comparison. One huge difference: I store mine in a cellar fridge set between 50-55; God knows what the kids fridge is set at but it's a *lot* colder. Maybe because of that the head was much larger and consistent with what photos here have illustrated. Definitely because of the temp differences the smell was more prominent as was the taste. The hops are still very forward and any drop off is indiscernible to my unrefined palate. There's still an underlying sweetness that I hope comes more to the fore with increased age. I'll probably pick up a 2019 sixer tomorrow for cellaring.

Pours a murky deep brown with a slight garnet hue, two fingers of thick creamy tan head. Nose of big dark fruit with a deep malty sweetness. Notes of raisin, pine bark, preserved fig, hard caramel candy, babka cake, fruit leather and just a hint of alcohol. Loved it! Taste follows the nose with the well melded flavors of sweet dark fruit, spicy babka and pine. Additionally I get a bit of roastiness of the back end as well as earthiness that seems to build on each sip. It's got a luxuriously smooth medium+ body with carbonation still there to prick the back of your palette 6 years in. This is the only bottle of '13 I have and I REALLY wish I had some more. Cheers to all of you still holding on to this one after all these days, it was worth the wait.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Look - Dark amber/brown in color with a heavy, large, prominent foam head  Smell - Minimal. The properties of the beer are hidden and not well portrayed in the aroma.  Taste - The flavor embodies the alcohol well. Strong and hoppy. The flavor is is of bittersweet chocolate and caramel. The alcohol is pronounced.  Feel - Well carbonated. Oily and resiny as expected.  Overall: This is my first of the style. The alcohol and flavor is strong but much milder than similar others of the style. Sweetness is moderate. Carbonation is heavy but hidden in the heavy, oily mouthfeel.. An interesting heavy beer that is well hopped and bitter, yet not too sweet, I prefer this to many other barleywines simply because of the relative low ABV but yet pronounced flavor.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Bottled on 12/1/17 (2018 release)    Pours a clean, effervescent deep maroon topped with a thick, fluffy off-white head; very solid retention results in thick walls of lacing and a steady collar when it recedes.    Aroma is heavily piney, but smooths out without becoming too aggressive; fairly one-dimensional, but the intermingling with light tones of sweeter, roasty caramel malt in the background really further the depth of a singular note and has it bursting.    Taste really brings forth some of the restrained aggression in the pine and hops with an earthy bitterness that builds calmly through to the finish; like the aroma, softer notes of caramel malt are present to diversify the profile as its few notes develop.    Mouthfeel shows a fairly robust medium body with a steadily increasing hoppy bitterness and a spectacularly leveled medium carbonation. Drying toward the finish, but a slight stickiness prevents it from doing so fully; overall, silky, gritty, and equal parts easy and aggressive on the palate; so excellently done.    Aggressive, hoppy, and singular in its profile, this is just a beast of a beer with some incredible balance shown throughout; easy to see why this could be considered a quintessential American barleywine. Very enjoyable.

Smell of caramel, molasses, burnt sugar and what my initial reaction was hops, but I think it's a pine note that my brain associates with hops. Taste follows the smell almost to a T, including a slight pine hint in there. Flavors are mellow and they mix well together. Medium bodied and a nice dry finish.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a chill hazed coppery deep amber producing variable head size from 2 fingers to voluminous depending on the purchase and pour. The head is tan, frothy and lasting. It leaves a wash of sticky lacing 1/2-1 inch above the collar ring regardless of total head height. Aroma is spicy, cake-like bready, sweet grain, caramel/toffee, subtle raisin, fig and white fruits; some grass & pine with a strong alcohol note. Taste is boozy sweet caramel/toffee, sweet bready malt, thin dark fruits with a chocolate hint. Hop presence is earthy herbal and pine. Hints of molasses, sweet potato casserole and white fruits appear as the brew warms. Starts sweet and remians so for most of the sip with a faint peppery prickle appearing briefly in the middle. Bitters between midsip and finish and hangs on into the aftertaste. Aftertaste is caramel malty, bitter pine, alcohol blend. Mouthfeel is moderately heavy with medium carbonation, smooth, silky with an hint of alcohol bite.

Molasses, burnt sugar, dates, caramely, Whoppers (the candy, not the burger).  T. Bitter and sweet, and not shy in either direction. Toasted malts, dark caramel, molasses, some smooth bitter dark chocolate, grassy piney hops, big dates. Pretty scrumptious.  F. Pretty full feel, smooth, sticky and resinous. Not boozy, only somewhat warming way in the end.  O. At 10 months it has terrific balance. I'd buy it again. Cheers ! ! !

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 2012 bottle, so nicely aged.    A - Dark brown body, mostly opaque with strong red and orange highlights, light tan head with an orange tint, and extensive small bubble lacing.    S - Harsh alcohol and pine notes, almost like floor cleaner, but in a manner that is not offensive per se. Caramel and lemon aspects are also there, offering something more pleasant.    T - A sipper, as you might expect. Opens with caramel sweetness, leading to lemon and bread, and a grassy, steeped tea bitter bite in the finish. That bite helps keep things from getting cloying but is itself a bit overpowering, particularly when the beer is still cold. You end up wanting to take another sip quick, but if you let it linger, the biting bitterness does trail off after peaking at about 30 seconds from the drink.    M - Moderate body, with a very dry and building finish.    O - This is a beer designed to sit and grow. And it does offer great flavor range, a mingling of bitterness and sweet caramel. Not a favorite style, but well built and offering quite a bit to chew on.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 2018 version. Pours a clear light to medium brown with ruby red highlights. a one inch creamy tan head that left nice blotches of lacing. Smells of lightly roasted malts, toffee, raisins and hops. Taste is far more bitter than I expected, somewhat sweet roasted malts, toffee, raisins, dates and alcohol. This beer is meant for sipping and needs to be drank at near room temperature. Full bodied, lightly carbonated, lingering dry and bitter finish.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A very dark ruby mixed with copper color on the pour. Very hard to see my finger on the other side of the glass. Tall two finger thick and creamy tan head topping the beer. Thhead looks like the topping on a root beer float! Heavy lacing on the glass just slicks down as you drink it.    The smell is very complex so give me a second here. Smells like toffee and roasted malts. Also picking up stone fruits like raisins. A bit of alcohol on the nose.    Hops, raisins and oh my! Picking up some roasted malts and a touch of sweetness. The hop bitterness is very pronounced at the front and back of the taste. The sweetness is kind of like a toffee unlike any I have tasted, like a bitter toffee.    Mouthfeel is full and that bitterness lingers. Finish seems a bit long and somewhat slick but crisper than what I thought.    Overall this is not a crushable or easy drinking beer. This is more of a sipper. The beer lover in me is trying to pull all I can out of this beer as it seems so complex. By the way this is the 2018 offering. The biigest thing I can pull out of this is the craftmanship that goes into this beer. It seems like it is so complex and wants to give the beer drinker so much more to enjoy. The heavy 9.6% ABV picks up on the tounge with a touch of a burn but very suttle. I cannot wait to see how this changes with time. Cheers!

It was good but was expecting more from an almost 10% ABV beer. I think they could have cut back on the bitterness just a tad as it was a bit overdone. The extreme taste transition from slightly sweet to very bitter was a bit much. Still have five left so I'll let those sit a while and revisit this one in the fall.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Never thought I would see this one again, but here it is in a 2018 version. This is a type of beer that is larger than life, a gigantic malty IPA with a bite. It reminds me of an Italian bitter liqueur called Cynar, which is made from artichokes and claims to "make everything that follows taste sweeter." Just one bottle of Bigfoot in a drinking session changes everything. More than one is not advised!   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 2018 bottle into my trusty Big Eddy shifter.

Some caramel & alcohol.    Tastes follows the smell with a strong bitter bite on the finish. Dark fruit, candied citrus peel.    Mouthfeel is medium bodied & slightly sticky. Carbonation not noticeable.    Overall, a solid american barley wine that I can see benefiting from some time in the cellar. It will be interesting to see what develops.

This was a lot hoppier than I was expecting - hops aren't bad of course, I do love my IPAs - but to me it was too overpowering on the bitter, piney hops. The malts do give it just a bit of a bittersweet flavor to it, and there's an interesting almost raisiny after-taste, but to me it feels unbalanced and too intense on my palate. It does look awesome - a deep red color with a head that never dissipated as I sipped it down. It also hides the alcohol well for 9.6%. I couldn't possibly say this is bad. I don't know how well it represents the style, but it's obviously a well-made beer. I just don't think it's for me.

Aroma is caramel sweetness at first followed immediately by the hops with citrus and spice. Flavor follows the aroma with some really intense bitterness like a punchy IPA. Warming mouthfeel, medium body and medium carbonation keeps it from sitting heavy on the palate. Barleywines, IPAs and hoppy beers are not my go-to in most cases, but I've had this in the past (fresh and aged) and I enjoy both for different reasons. This is a huge and aggressive beer fresh, looking forward to having another next year for an entirely different experience.

Clear toffee-brown colored body, with a light tan head that took a few minutes to settle into a nice cap. This was allowed to warm to cellar temperature in the glass. Malt-forward aroma, mostly caramel and dark bread. The alcohol is very prominent on the nose as well as the palate. As aggressively hopped as this is, there is a ton of resiny bitterness that coats the tongue and lingers on the finish. Some cellaring might mellow this out somewhat. As is, it's still a very good beer.

Smells of caramel malt and grassy hops, with a hint of toffee, dark fruit and pine. Taste is a nice balance of caramel, bready malt and citrus, piney hops, with a certain grainy, grassy, earthy quality. Notes of toffee, dark fruit, chocolate and pine. This is my first Barley Wine, and I'm not sure what to make of it, to be honest. It kinda reminds me of a strong American Amber Ale, but a little more mellow, with more earthy, grainy notes. Its high ABV is actually hidden rather nicely, except for a slight warming presence, but balance is not quite to my taste. Not bad, but not really for me either.

The main reason I go out of my way for the SN barley wine is the hop profile of course. Might not be as traditional as many other barley wines but that is exactly why I like it so much. It pours a nice reddish brown with a nice fluffy head and leaves a nice sticky lace all the way down the snifter as it's consumed. I like to swirl the sediment on the bottom of the bottle to get that hazy appearance and add a little more head potential from the yeast, also puts some bread dough in the mix if you look for it. The balance of the hops and the malt is just right for my taste, Sweet caramel with a touch of pine seems perfect and almost too easy to drink. Alcohol is almost non present. I chill the beer cold like any other IPA and take my time sipping it to enjoy the other flavors that unravel as it warms. Molasses and candied yams come to mind later on. Not too heavy going down due to the mid range tiny bubble carbonation profile. Bitterness is present somewhere in the middle to end. Balance is the key to this treat and that's why it works in the this years version as well, as it should and as it has in all earlier vintages. Cheers   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Having had this many times but currently having a 2018 fresh bottle poured into a snifter:    L: more amber ruby, cherry red than remembered but still looks delicious. Also is brown but depends on angle and lighting. Minimal head that turns to super thin lacing     A: deathtone hoppy alcohol faint malts with a bit of sweetness     T: citrus caramel, earthy hops mixed with floral nutty toffee along with grassy, malts, pine notes. But on the sweet side yet can clearly tell you're dealing with a Bigfoot monster.    F: pine bitterness, medium to heavy, smooth subtle warming booze    O: delicious and have amother 2018 as well as a 2017, 2016, and 2014 barrel aged in my cellar. But even fresh this beer is amazing.

The cap of off white is creamy and last forever.  S - Hot hops in the nose, cascade and burnt butter, notes of toffee, and light charrd oak  T - Follows the nose well, no surprises, add to the nose some orange reduction and a bit of light tobacco  M - Medium in body, just right in slick feel, Carbonation does an excellent job cleaning up  O - A classic for sure, I expect this will simmer down with a year or two resting.

It was unlike anything I had ever tried before and even in years hence I continued to regard it as a remarkable example of barleywine. Today I saw it while in the checkout line, and on a whim decided to grab a six-pack.    With this latest effort, Sierra Nevada has utterly destroyed this previously-cherished offering.    The description on the bottle already had me a bit worried: "heaps of whole-cone, Pacific Northwest hops." Huh?! What do hops have to do with a barleywine?? They're an afterthought.    Look: Head sticks to the glass, and color is the deep reddish hue that I would expect. Does not bear the same cloudiness that I remember from previous iterations, however.    Smell: Fairly unremarkable. There's a hint of the old Bigfoot deep down somewhere in there, with vanishingly faint notes of raisin and dark fruits under the cacophony of hop oils. I practically have to touch my nose to the liquid to sense it.    Taste: It has not a trace of the sweet raisin flavor I originally fell in love with. The previously rich, syrupy malt has been utterly demolished by an astringent, choking load of hops that has me clearing my throat and chugging water. And for that bitterness I'm not even rewarded with the citrus earthiness of the typical IPA.    Feel: Doesn't have the rich creaminess that it had in previous years. Otherwise unremarkable.    Overall: Literally, what is the point of this beer?? It is literally pointless. It has no place in the world. There are plenty of double IPAs in the world. Why did they need to make one that didn't have the malty sweetness to backup those hops?? They should be ashamed of themselves. They have destroyed something that used to be a cornerstone of Great Beer. This is on the order of the destruction of Palmyra, the ancient World Heritage site which has has recently been ravaged by Syrian conflict.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.75 Bigfoot 2018.    The overall appeal of Sierra Nevada has never been for me. Bigfoot is a bland example of what a Barleywine is. Oh wow. Hops. Celebration is better and that ain't saying much by any means.    I'd say chalky, but I'd attribute that to the overall hop character and a drastic lack of maltiness. Sad really.    I'd never ask for my money back, but if you handed me this beer and called it good? Probably going to judge you really hard.     What do I think this is closer to? A dubble passed off as a Barleywine if that makes any sense.

There is a bit of a citrus flavor with orange being the most prominent. It also has a low level of spice.    Feel: It has a moderately full body that is not quite chewy. The bitterness is moderate and the malt and hops last long into the finish.    Overall: This is an excellent combination of flavors and aromas that makes me want to drink this like a session ale.

A deep sweet malt, toffee, slight molasses flavor pervades but there is also a sizable hop bitterness present that manifests itself in citrus and a bit of pine flavor.    Feel: thick, smooth, and enough carbonation to balance things out. Would be terrible in an IPA for instance but it's exactly what you want in a barleywine     Overall: an exceptional beer, fairly well balanced but still more hop presence than I expected. Would like to put a few more years on one of these bottles and see how it shakes out.

(4.25)    O:  Really an excellent beer.  I have historically said I didn't like Barleywines. Damn you for proving me wrong, Jacob!!! This is a beautiful beer.  It has an amazing aroma that pretty much covers the spectrum of malt flavors. The hops are a nice, bracing contrast to this. The flavor follows suit with a medley of toffee, oak and fruity notes with a bitter bite that cleans up your palate. This one gets great as it warms (and as you warm with it).   A real treat! Looks like I'm going to have to stop avoiding this style. (4.25)

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Had this one with 5 years of age on it (2012 vintage)    Surprisingly robust and long-lasting head given the age and ABV. Great lacing. Aromas are very sweet -- mostly molasses, maple, brown sugar, and caramel. Some grassy hoppiness as well. Tastes retain a good amount of tea-like/grassy hop character and an intense barley malt presence that borders on being cloying. Good amount of tannins. Somewhat velvety mouthfeel. Medium carb. Long-lasting, bitter finish. Overall I don't like the way the hops age on this one as much as on other sweet barleywines like Old Ruffian -- it's pretty one-dimensionally grassy    79/100   
look: 3 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 3 @sierranevada 2016 Bigfoot. An American Barleywine. 9.6% ABV Chico, CA     Look: A murky caramel brown with a medium khaki head. No activity visible.     Smell: Sticky and boozy on the nose. Notes of dried figs, golden rum cake, tree sap, pine cones, golden raisins, toffee, and big floral hops. The alcohol is strong and vaporous. Reminiscent of a tawny port with pine cones and bitter hops.     Taste: Intense. Upfront there is a brief sticky attack of golden raisins and toffee. Then the palate is put into what I can only describe as a choke hold of bitter pine hops. This bitterness dominates the palate until the end of the body where hints of golden molasses, whole wheat bread, and dried dates are able to poke through. However that is quickly overwhelmed again by the finish which is a heavyweight wrestling match of sharp astringent booze and more floral hops bitterness.     Feel: Big, chewy, resinous. This beer takes hold of the palate and gives no reprieve. High bitterness. High alcohol. Medium carbonation.     Overall: The quality of this beer is immediately apparent. It’s drinks “clean” as in there is no real flaws to speak of. However this works against this beer for me. This is seemingly how the brewers want this beer to be experienced. Yet, this beer isn’t exactly pleasant to drink. It’s so bitter and chewy. The bitterness absolutely dominates to the point that doesn’t let the rest of the the beer shine. This should balance the stark sweetness of a barleywine. You could even do it in an out of balance way to match the American style but it goes too far in in the hops. This one has almost 3 years in the bottle. Might have to age it even further to let some of those hops drop out. Can’t see myself drinking this very often. Maybe checking up on it every few years.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 I was glad to find this one from Sierra, as they are one of my favorite breweries - and I love barleywine so the joy was double. It is from 2015 so by today (2017) it is already somewhat vintage.  Actually it is a barleywine-style ale the bottle says and right, it is not as syrupy as a normal barleywine would be. It is rather like a heavily hopped ale and Sierra are masters of this kind of beer. Along with heavly caramellized malts I feel loads of hops, especially perhaps bittering hops? because the aftertaste is quite bitter with quite a complexity. Very good that the body is lighter than a usual barleywine, but the remarkable taste is still there both in the nose and the feel. Makes me feel like a very very rich IPA... the richness of the hops is amazing, perhaps with Sierra's trademark Cascades? If I had to compare it to something, perhaps it is similar to the Arrogant Bastard Ale - and this should tell it all: it is amazing!  An excellent beer this is, Sierra did a great job again. It is a piece of art.

For beer #100 I had to review the beer that got me hooked on craft beer about 10 years ago. This vintage isn’t as great as past years. That first year (1998 or 1999) was a standout. So was 2008, their anniversary edition. This year’s isn’t as exceptional as those examples, but it’s pretty damn good. Aroma is of bananas, spiced apples, caramel--strong malty presence. Pours a huge head with good lacing. Dark copper hue. Light carbonation. Initially sweet, turns bitter. The bitterness and strong alcohol presence linger. This is still my favorite barleywine. ----- 2/14/10. Vertical tasting of the 2009 and 2010 vintages. This is my re-rank (and comparison with the 2010) of the 2009 vintage. 7/5/8/5/17 (4.2 total score). 12 oz bottle. Aroma of caramel, Christmas spices; malty. Murky amber hue. Medium dissipating head with nice lacework (better than the ’10). Mellow, awesome maltiness on the tongue. Starts out sweet, finishes bitter. Medium carbonation. ----- Ranking of the 2010 vintage (and comparison with the 2009): 7/4/9/5/17 (4.2 total). 12 oz bottle. Much hoppier aroma than the ’09. Lots of citrus. Not as murky as the ’09, but the same hue. Way hoppier than the ’09. Not as complex. Medium carbonation. ----- In summary, drinking these two beers back to back, I prefer the ’10 because it’s hoppier, although it’s really freaking close. I think the ’10 will mellow in a year and be much like the ’09 tastes now. The ’09 is more complex, and more interesting, but not as drinkable. This beer is meant to be aged, though, so I’m thinking the ’09 is closer in taste to what the brewers want it to taste like in the end.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 It pours a dark red/brown in my chalice. No head forms, but a slight white film clings to the sides of the chalice. Spider-web like lacing graces the sides of the chalice. The smell has the hops up front, coming forth in an earthy/woody way, some light citrus comes out as the beer warms. The taste is bitter with the previously mentioned flavors adding a bit of a tobacco flavoring in a boozy sort of way. It becomes slightly sweet as the beer warms. The palate is heavy with some slight harshness on the tongue, still smooth and slightly creamy. I’d say this isn’t exactly that drinkable, ABV aside, but it is an American Barleywine, so its expected. Overall, though the hops come forth strong in the smell and taste than most barleywines I’ve had, I still liked this. The normal complexities of a barleywine come out to make this a great offering from Sierra Nevada.

A thick, almost viscous, pour with vestigal head and light lacing. The aroma catches the nose right away with a blast of bourbon and smoke. Very nice taste, complex and deep. The first impression is that your're having a shot of Kentucky bourbon, then it mellows out to a heavy malt, sweet and boozy. Aging is a necessity for these SN ales. Buy it, then give it a year.

The previous copy of this beer I had was fresh from the brewery, and I found the extreme bitterness too strong for my taste. The barrel-aged version; however, is one of my favorite beers. Upon trying this 3-year shelf-aged sample, I found the extreme bitterness tamed quite a bit; not quite to the barrel-aged level, but very, very good!    Poured into Teku at 47F. On first sip, I got a dark oily flavor that I didn't really appreciate, but that mostly faded as I proceeded through the glass. The strong, but mellowed bitterness leaves a strong, long lasting aftertaste that wears very well. I drank this yesterday, and am still thinking about it. This was very similar to the barrel-aged version, just without the wood flavors.    Barley wines have great bitterness, without the hoppy flavor of an IPA; which is one of the reasons I like this style. They are also high ABV, which stimulates the toungue, and adds a dreaminess to the flavor.    Now, back to the store to buy the rest of their 2014 stock.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 2017 release.  12 oz. bottle poured into a nonic style pint glass.     Look- A clear, deep red amber body topped by one and a half fingers of tan foamy head with some lacing.  Smell- Moderate strength but a little one dimensional. Dominated by resinous hops with a hint of caramel malt.  Taste- As with the nose, very hop forward. The bitterness is rather high, but good front to back. There is just enough malty sweetness to keep the hoppiness in check.  Feel- Medium bodied but definitely to the high side, it has a nice weight to it. Smooth with good medium carbonation.  Overall- Good stuff. The alcohol isn't very noticeable in the nose or taste. It makes sense that if cellared the hoppiness would diminish bringing hop and malt to more of a balance. It's pretty good as is though and I needed to make a conscious effort to sip, not drink it.

Super malty smelling beer, with a little bit of booze wafting out. Taste is of pale? roasted malts, syrup/molasses, roasted sugary caramel, booze, and has a crisp, refreshing finish and an ever present aftertaste on the back of the tongue with a touch of hops. Pretty easy to drink despite my initial assesments when purchasing the beer. Nice and creamy feel and taste. Really enjoyed this one. Sierra Nevada does it again

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12 oz bottled 12/4/14 (beer is 29 months in cellar at time of review) poured into a Sierra Nevada imperial tulip pint at fridge temp. The beer is brownish copper in color with thick sticky khaki 3" head from an aggressive pour. The head settles to a quarter inch with abundant lacing. Aroma is burnt sugar, caramel and rich malt. The taste retains little of the bitterness that characterizes this beer young. More burnt sugar/caramel comes out in a sip but it retains enough hop taste and bite to not be sweet. Mouthfeel is full and moderately carbonated. It finishes fairly dry for the amount of malt present. Overall, very good. As I grow older, I appreciate this beer more with time than fresh.

No time like the present, I suppose.     From the bottle: "Bigfoot is a beast of a beer, brimming with bold, bittersweet malt flavor and heaps of whole-cone Pacific Northwest hops. First introduced in 1983, Bigfoot is a cult classic prized by beer collectors. Drink it fresh or cellar it in a cool, dark place to taste as the flavors develop over time."    My first dip into this particular pool with be with a very young, very fresh 2017 bottle. Having Pop!ped the cap, a gentle pour seemed to be the order of the day. A vigorous in-glass swirl raised just under two fingers of dense, foamy, deep-tan/light-brown head with decent retention that left behind loads of sticky lacing as it fell. Color was Coppery-Brown (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was boozy with a minty, piney quality. As I said, this bottle is young and will undoubtedly smooth out, given sufficient time. Mouthfeel was big and thick, like a dollop had been scooped onto my tongue. Ahhh! It burns! Well, kind of, anyway. It was definitely a young version of this beer, evincing a lot of fusel alcohol heat to go along with all of those piney, minty hops. Phew! The hops were really overwhelming the malts at this stage in its development, but I will agree with their mention of "bittersweet". This was definitely an American Barleywine. Finish was dry, hot, boozy & evocative of another nap. Jeez-o, man, I just awoke from one! This is no playin' around.    And now, a 2016 vintage on M, 19 June 2017.    I Pop!ped this 1.5 year-old cap and commenced the gentlest pour possible. It was clearly not done fermenting as the head just kept rising during the pour to create a finger of creamy, dense, layered, deep-tan/light-brown head with phenomenal retention. Color was Brown to Dark Brown (SRM = > 22, < 27) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had begun to take on a leathery quality. Mouthfeel was surprisingly thin-to-medium, not watery, but close. The hops, while still minty, had begun to fade, giving rise to an alcohol heat underlain by that leathery, bready maltiness noted on the nose. I felt like it was still in its early stages, much more hoppy than I would like in a Barleywine, even if it was of an American bent. The hops have to fade & die at some point, which is why I actually prefer the English Barleywines, even as a hophead. Finish was dry, mainly due to the unrelenting heat of the alcohol. I am sure that it will die down like the embers of a fire.    Next up, a 2013 vintage again on M, 19 June 2017.     The Pop! of the cap was uneventful, so I commenced a VERY gentle pour. It quickly became clear that it had lost none of its carbonation as I garnered better than a finger of dense, foamy, deep-tan/light-brown head with fantastic retention. Color was a gorgeous Coppery-Brown (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. It had the same rusty sheen as the hair on my beloved Linda Lou who I lost to a deployment as she married another man. Sigh. Mouthfeel was medium with a carbonated quality that seemed to scrub my tongue. The taste was STILL driven by pine & evergreen, underlain by the emerging leatheriness. OMFG! How long does it take?!? Finish was still rather hot & in need of more aging! Wow.    It is now T, 20 June 2013 & Mr. Peabody's WAYBAC machine takes us to 2005!    No head, even with a swirl. Color has deepened to a Brown to Dark Brown (SRM = > 22, < 27) and the clarity is crystal-clear. Nose has an anise aspect to accompany the leatheriness that has been common throughout. Mouthfeel was soft, very lightly carbonated, but the alcohol heat was becoming very pronounced. The taste was extremely leathery with undercurrents of dried dark fruits like currants, prunes & raisins. Finish was now as dry as any sherry. Phew!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 2017 version, reviewed about 4 months after bottling.     L: Reddish-brown body with a creamy light tan head.    S: I get mostly caramel malt. A little bit of pine and some raisins and other dark fruits.    T: Pretty intense flavor. A good play back and forth between the caramel like malts and bitterness of the hops. Hops are very bitter and intense with a lot of pine and earthy notes. Although it is pretty intense, it seems to be balanced pretty well.     F: Pretty full bodied and creamy. Lingering bitterness/dryness.     O: As excepted, this is very bitter as young as it is. There are some definite fruity undertones that I think might be more pronounced if this had a year or two to age. I'll try to find out.

Dark malts, slightly winey finish. All in all it's not quite what I was expecting or what I've gotten from other barleywines.    Edit:  This beer is incredible this go around, has characteristics similar to a porter but instead of the caramel, coffee, cocoa malts it's much more fruity and refreshing, alongside excellent carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Aged just over a year:    Pours a deep coppery Brown with a one finger off white head. Dissipates within a couple minutes to a little veil of bubbles and a halo. Some alcohol legs.    Aromas of rich toffee and malt, dates, prunes, sweet dark fruit. Lesser notes of caramel, brulee, papaya, and a hint of nuttiness.    Taste is sweet dark fruit up front, mostly prunes and dates, some raisin, caramel, toffee, and some of that nuttiness that came through on the nose. Then as the sweetness mellows out the bitter starts to come through, playing on flavors of black tea, rooibos, dark chocolate, burnt sugar, peat, and pine. It's a rather bold bitterness drawing off from both char and herbal qualities.    It's light to medium bodied, fairly smooth with a light tingly carbonation. Slightly astringent and a touch of heat from the alcohol.    This is a very bold and classic American Barleywine, starting off similar to it's English brethren but bursting with bitterness on the finish. It's a sipper but not incredibly intricate. My favorite part is the tea like flavors as the sweetness fades and the bitterness enters.

Smell is of intense pine, slight melon/cantelope, with a sweet bready malt scent coming through. Mild amount of sweet caramel intermingles. No alcohol detected. Taste reflects the smell. Intense initial pine and earthy hops lead into a splendid caramel and sweet fruit flavor. Finishes with a great mix of sweet caramel malt and a small but lingering bitterness. Some alcohol head is present if you really look for it but it does not detract from the beer. Feel is semi-thick, chewy, it fits the sweeter elements of the beer. Overall, this is a really good beer with great flavors that I imagine will mellow over time. Fresh, it's a treat. Fresher, I would imagine it's even more of a treat.

Smells of caramel, ripe oranges, dried wild berries, wood bark and fresh cut lemons.     Has a soft, lower carbonation, displaying a medium bodied beer, which has a convincing balance to it, although the finish in this is pushing it, in regards of its bitter hop impact.     Tastes of toffee malts, glazed caramel and bakers chocolate, together with an earthy note, from which slowly a herbal dryness evolves. Its midpalate is still defined by the malts, but now the hops are easily recognizable for their leafy lemon bite. The finish is a complete turnover, it is utmost bitter and dry, with a ripe, malt accompanied fruitiness cutting through.    Wow, this is intense. The beer has a marvellous taste evolution. While it begins like a regular barley wine, sweet, fruity and malty, it finishes unexpectedly dry with a bitter fruit note to it. Very well made and outstandingly well build, everything comes together perfectly in this.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Copper pour with sticky thick off-white head, lacing aplenty. Nothing more needed in looks in a glass.   Nose is hops, all pine goodness, and a hint of fruit esters.   Taste is a full-on harmony of hops and underlying malts, the latter of which don't bring forth much sweetness like I usually like in a barleywine, however the balance of this big stuff is very nice given the huge hop presence. Fruit is a far away hint, malts are in check, and with the hops the end result gives me the impression of a Sierra Nevada Celebration IPA crossed with a Sierra Nevada Hoptimum. Nothing complex, but so well-made. Each sip brings more hints of fruit: crisp cherry-apple.   Medium-bodied and some oily/ smooth, bitterness.   Just a bunch of big tasty beer with ample raw hops. I'm certain this would be a perfect 5-across the board on a couple years + of aging, but in my book there's no trouble detecting a high quality beer no matter how early it's cracked open.

New label looks great and love the six instead of four pack. Pours a garnet, ruby body with a bubbly head. My god the aroma - huge hops (pine, grapefruit, spruce) and doughy malt. Forgot how hop-forward this is. Taste (after it warms a bit) is an upfront burst of pine, grapefruit, blood orange proceeding to candied fruit, honey, dark fruit and roasted malt. Finishes bitter with a good dose of alcohol heat and tobacco-tea like notes. A true beast of a beer that mellows with age.

Poured a murky brown with ruby red highlights; a small tan head that dissipated to some sticky lace around the edge of the glass. Smelled of coconut, marzipan, cherries, alcohol, prunes, and almonds. The smell was right down to the nose: cherries, prunes, figs, some slight funk and dry spice, grass, and a grimy tobacco aftertaste; there was even some alcohol in the flavor as well. It seemed off and perhaps it's because it's a 3 year-old bottle. It was chewy and full-bodied. A slight dirty feel. It was okay. Maybe I will only let it sit in my cellar for a year next time.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Ruby amber and mostly hazy with a dust storm of sediment in the middle of the glass. Topped with 2 fingers of beige head. Nice, layered lacing.    Creme brulee, citrusy hop cones, sweet and syrupy, like brown rice syrup. Light toasted notes.    Creme brulee, toasted notes, a solid sweetness, complex toasted notes, sometimes wafting in like the smoke from a camp fire. There are hints of hops which have fallen off, clean linen, and definite alcohol presence. Theres that sort of stinky foot I often find in barley wines as well.    Thick and syrupy body, surprisingly foamy and smooth carbonation.    Left a little long at 2 years, I wish to try this one fresh. Up to par for sure in the style, just not getting the hops. I left it in the cottage cabinet for 2 years in my parents basement, drinking it on arrival for my first time in 2 years in Canada. 2014 Bottle, drank Sept 21st 2016 .

Smell: Dry dark red fruits like dates and raisins. Raspberries and cherries. Rich caramel malt. Orange pith and huge notes of pine resin. Notes of cotton candy.    Taste: Hard to describe. Very astringent with notes of bitter pine sap and grapefruit upfront. The sweetness of the malt slowly creeps in - it's quite savory and chewy. Gradually the flavors of dark red fruits set in, revealing notes of strawberry, sugarplums and raisins. There's a delicious maple syrup/brown sugar presence too.    Feel: Medium with light carbonation. Alcoholic.    Overall: This isn't my go to style of beer, so take my rating with a grain of salt, but I do enjoy a nice Barleywine from time to time. This one makes for a good beer to slowly sip and savor over the course of an evening.     On a side note, the barrel aged version is infinitely better. The time spent in the barrel rounding out some of the harsh edges and really elevating a "great" beer to the rank of "world class".

Smells of blackstrap molasses and oranges. Taste has a bitterness throughout it, malt up, reminiscent of rye 'n' injun bread (corn and rye bread made with molasses), fades into orange zest and brown sugar. Finish lingers for a while on the tongue. Medium to full body beer, thick and creamy that easily rolls about the tongue. This is just some downright good stuff.

Malt is more prevalent though, some dried fruit, slightly metallic finish. This is a sensory delight, a lot going on here. Enjoying this immensely.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Look: Dark, copper orange with a decent head that lingers for a minute or two, then turns to lacing and floats like a slick on top.  Smell:Oranges and strawberries, sugar, hops  Taste: Strong malt presence and hop bitterness. Not quite DIPA, but it conjures up many of the same taste attributes. Red berries and citrus zest, along with a bit of citrus peel bitterness.  Feel: Slick. Heavy. Smoot. Almost creamy. Definitely let this one warm up. Very fine carbonation.  Overall: Not an overbearing alcohol presence although you get some heat. It's a slow sipper that packs a ton of flavor. Would I get again? Probably not, but if I were given one, I'd have no qualms about having another.    Edit 2: 8/5/17 - having a brewed on 12/31/15 bottle poured into a tulip.   Look: Reddish brown hue with a dark tan head consisting of very tiny bubbles.   Smell: Hoppy. Malty. Hoppy. Sweet. Floral earth notes. Still slightly citrusy on the nose too.   Flavor: Not as pungent as last time around, this has mellowed out a bit but is still hoppy tasting, still like a very malty 2x IPA than the original hop-bomb this was. Bitterness has definitely subsided and is a bit more sweet than I recall.  Feel: Thick, very viscous. Still has a good amount of carbonation. Heavy going down. Flavors cling to your mouth.  Overall: This has aged well so far and is now much more palatable (~1.5 years after bottling). Still have two more in the basement.

About the nicest color I've seen. I understand why this beer is rated so high; in its class it's excellent. I'm just not a huge fan of the style. Still, I recognize its probably great in its class.

The aroma is a massive dose of sweet malt with notes of fog and dates. I taste a massive wallop of sweet malt with a slightly bitter aftertaste. The mouth was chewy, thick, any d warm with alcohol. This was a 2013 edition.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 2016 vintage    Appearance - Pours a copper with three fingers of foamy tan head.    Smell - bready caramel malts, citrus and piney hops, hint of pine resin, hint of grapefruit peel, and hint of soapiness.    Taste - Bready caramel malts followed by the bitter citrus and piney hops. The hint of pine resin, grapefruit peel, and soapiness finish the brew off.    Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes with a pleasant lingering bitterness from the hops.     Overall - A stellar American Barleywine that showcase the hops very well. The malts act as a nice supporting cast to the brew. An enjoyable brew from the folks at Sierra Nevada.

The color is a shiny copper and it keeps a flavorful head throughout the drinking time. While I prefer stouts and am not likely to seek this out again, I am interested in seeing how the rest of the bottles age.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25 I'm not a fan of this style generally, but I couldn't pass up on a 2014 bottle of this I found in a bottle shop. Body is a reddish mahogany color with a rocky, off-white head. Not much lacing or head retention here but I wouldn't expect that from a higher alcohol beer. Smells like over ripe fruit, caramel, and alcohol. Taste is super complex, I actually had some taste bud fatigue afterwards. Lots of dark fruit (raisins, plums), very rich caramel, wood, smoke, chocolate, leather...it's also much hoppier than I thought it would be, although I imagine some of that's faded by now. Getting some resinous and citrus type bitterness. It's overall extremely sweet, but the hops add enough bitterness to keep it from feeling too heavy. It's a good thing too, because this beer borders on a syrupy mouthfeel and needs all the lightening up it can get. Not unpleasantly syrupy in small doses (this isn't a beer you want to exactly chug anyway), and overall pretty smooth and creamy considering the ABV. Alcohol presence is definitely noticeable, a little like scotch. This is one of the more extreme beers I've tried and it isn't something I would want to drink more than once a year, but I can appreciate how intricate the flavors here are.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Appearance: Beautiful deep red amber gold, light cap, moderate lacing.    Aroma: An admixture of stuff which to me combines a rich, malt forward brew with Oloroso Sherry notes. Not sweet, nor dry, but a very complex melange of very nice things.    Taste: Malt, yes, malt with an advanced college degree. Too complex for simple notes to stand out yet hops are present supporting the rich malt, no hint of roasted malt bitterness but the same full malt character of a good Stout without really tasting anything like a Stout. There is the dark fruit ripeness of a great Belgian, fullness of a Doppelbock, yet something entirely different as if the best of Old World strong beers came to our shores and became changed, updated, without giving up the heritage.    Texture: Full bordering on fuller.    Overall: An excellent brew, something for the connoisseur yet very approachable for the curious minded amateur.

Pours a deep, dark, hazy orange-red with one thin finger of tan head that leaves tropical island archipelago lace as it recedes.    Smells of stewed blood oranges, sweet caramel malt, raisin, citrus zest and pine resin.    Tastes of more spicy bittersweet orange, caramel apple, boozy raisins and a lot of piney hops.    Feels rich and smooth. Full bodied with creamy carbonation. Finishes long and dry.    Verdict: Vigorously recommended. Big and satisfying.

Pours with a nice tan head that dissipates slowly.    Smell: Nice hop aroma, largely citrus, but some earthy hops are noticeable.     Taste: Smooth. Nice hop flavor right off the bat, followed by a caramel malt flavor. For such a big beer the alcohol is absurdly well blend.    Mouthful: Very nice smooth body. Medium carbonation.    Overall: This is an outstanding American Barleywine. Nicely hopped, but not over-hopped. For such a big beer its very well blend.

Massive hoppy aroma, Cascade, chinook.     Taste substantial malts, lots of caramel and toffee, but definitely unsweetened. Giant hop amounts. So good, evolves into something sweeter. Sticky when warm, but a massive hop blast. Can make you forget how strong it is until it is too late. Very bitter, but all those malt notes keep it from being problematic, in fact, this beer is quite awesome. Been drinking this for 20 years. Never gonna stop. Unless they stop 4/6 packing it.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 12oz bottle. 12/4/15 bottle date. Appearance: Reddish brown in color, slight haze, and a beige khaki foam head. Aroma: Rich maltiness of bread crusts and toffee. Light citrusy hop aromas as well. Taste: Deep, rich maltiness. Bready and caramel up front, giving way to more of a toasty and toffee flavor. Sharp, strong bitterness hits on the back end with citrus and pine. Overall flavors are very fresh and sharp. Mouthfeel: Medium heavy body with some chewiness, with a light carbonation. Strong alcohol heat. Finish: Sharp flavor of the beer lasts long past the swallow. Malt forward for sure, with some caramel and toast, as well as a strong resinous bitterness. Overall: The label is absolutely right, this is a beast of a beer. Strong, rich, boozy maltiness from the start with multiple layers of caramel, bread, toast, and toffee. Citric hop bitterness is very strong and does a good job of standing up to the malt. This beer is 4 months old, and the intensity is very high, almost overpowering. Looking forward to trying another Bigfoot at 1 year and seeing how it softens and develops different flavors

It smells of caramel, raisin, and malt, with some floral hops.You can also smell the alcohol. The first taste is dark, sweet fruit (raisin, cherry), followed by malt, pine, and then a very hoppy, bitter finish. This ale is quite thick and syrupy in its feel and it seems boozier than its 9.6% ABV would indicate. Overall, it is a good example of an American Barleywine, although I prefer the less bitter, English style.

Taste: Wow; This is really good....Almost a reverse DIPA,   in that the initial notes for me are immediately bitter   citrus-pine/booze, then a strong/lingering malty/syrupy   sweetness follows.    Feel: Syrupy; thick.    Overall: Homerun: (at least as of this initial tasting.) Reminds me   of a pumped-up version of my fav DIPA that's been crossed  with a strong, malty wee heavy.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 2.25 | overall: 4 BOD 12/4/15. Beautiful clear rich dark ruby pour. World class head volume, lacing and uber world class retention.    Outstanding nose of fruit (plum, raisin, grape), caramel and light citrus hops over a subtle spruce spiciness. As it warms, notes of alcohol emerge.    Light medium body with a smooth texture. Below normal carbonation with very little effervescence even in the finish.    The flavor profile is outstanding with balance being the strongest suit. The flavors are rich and deep beginning with bitterness that flows into a nice caramel sweet middle. As the sweetness fades, fruit flavors emerge but don't separate very much. The finish is reasonably astringent as the alcohol becomes uncovered but never becomes dry. A mild pine centered bitterness lingers.

Surprisingly unbalanced although it changes a bit as it warms.    Medium, not heavy but full mouthfeel. Extremely long lingering bitterness on the finish.    Certainly the hoppiest Barleywine I've ever had. It's a great representation of how far you can take the style but to me the most interesting thing about this beer is how it will change over time as the hops melt away. Looking forward to one every few months.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I have not had many barleywine style beers so I was eager to give this category classic a whirl. The beer had a pretty substantial amount of nice looking yellowed white head on top of the rich, well filtered auburn liquid below. Big boozy aromas of caramel and toffee commingled with a pronounced spruce note. The flavor was quite a bit more bitter than I was expecting. This was a fairly fresh 2016 bottle so the hop punch was definitely all up in my grill piece. I would love to get a few more bottles of this to let them age for a while. I want those hops to recede and let the malts shine a lot more. I'm also curious to know where Sierra nevada's rendition of the American barleywine fits in the style bucket. Are they typically quite bitter and hoppy or is Bigfoot an outlier? More delicious research must be done and I'm just the guy to do it.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Very dark amber in color with a thick white head on top. Can smell sweet fruits. Taste is very sweet caramel, roasted barley and hoppy bitterness at the finish.

The head slowly disappated leaving nice lacing.    The smell is huge caramel malts. There is a decent amount of dark fruits and maybe a hint of hops.    The taste is very forward on the dark fruits with the caramel jumping in quickly the dominate the middle and end of the flavor. The caramel is sweet on the end with a little lingering bitterness also.    The mouthfeel is medium bodied with and the carbonation of fairly light.    Overall a great beer. I'm excited to try some older versions to see how the bitterness mellows out.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Pours a rich burgundy, with a foamy white head. A little bit of lacing left behind. Citrus and piney hop notes mingle amidst sweet barley aromas. Very sweet, but bitter. Sweet barley grains and malt notes open up the front end, with bitter, piney hop notes biting off the end. Mouth feel is a little harsh as far as carbonation, but finishes smoothish. A little bit lacking here. Overall, a solid barleywine style ale. The hop presence is notable. Not incredibly sweet due to the hop presence. Still worth trying.     Served in a 12oz snifter.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Without knowing too much about barley wine, this has to be one of the more surprising beers from Sierra Nevada. Very tasty despite bitter. Well balanced in its own way in sweetness and bitterness, thats why surprising.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Pours a dark red or ruby with medium or slightly slower than medium carbonation. The smell is of booze, bourbon, figs, resinous piney hops. Taste is much of the same, with some deep bitterness and some dark fruit, bourbon and booze there too. I really wouldn't compare this to a double ipa, the hop flavor really doesn't dominate here and the other qualities for this beer remind you of old ales, belgian dark strongs just with an intense bitterness and resinous hop flavor. Very enjoyable, complex beer to sip on. This one was fresh, from 2016. Compared to the bourbon barrel aged one I tried at the sierra nevada restaurant, this one had sharper flavors. The barrel aged version was still fairly bitter but the bourbon and dark fruit were center stage.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 12oz bottle poured into a snifter shaped wine glass. Pours a clear ruby-russet, with a one finger tan head, which quickly recedes, leaving trace lacing. The nose is very hop-forward...perhaps too much so. Present also however are medicinal elements of raspberry and grape. This beer at first smells closer to an APA than a barleywine, though deeper smells more congruent with the named style emerge after a little time. The palate opens with the boozy malt of a barleywine, which is at first surprising, as the nose indicates anything but a classic English barleywine, but these grape, malt, and booze elements are quickly accompanied by the classic Sierra Nevada hop taste: the same as is found in their signature Pale Ale, in Hop Hunter, and many of their other more astringent ales. These hops don't do the beer any favors, but as I've progressed through the four-pack this week, I find them less noticeable, and less distracting from a good barleywine that hides underneath. In that way, it's not dissimilar from Devil's Milk from DuClaw - an equally (perhaps overly) hopped barleywine. Mouthfeel is an appropriate medium-thick, creamy that accompanies the high ABV and deeper flavors well, though there's perhaps a little more carbonation hiding in this beer than I find ideal for the style. Overall, not a bad beer, and a reasonably priced 4-pack.    More generally speaking: I was very underwhelmed with this beer when I had the first bottle of the four pack - it tasted like a barleywine made by a company who doesn't know how to make anything without "pale ale" in the title. The more I've had though, the more the beer has grown on me. As the beer warms, the hop presence recedes, and reveals a quality, dark fruit, boozy barleywine underneath.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 I should recognize success when I drink it. And, it is in this bottle.  But the different drummer in me wants to say that hops, ultimately, are the servant of malt... especially in this style.  Not here. Not in this barleywine. I'm not flowing with the mainstream, in part because the hops dominate and prevent this barleywine from helping most deserts.    I thought I should cellar part of the six-pack I bought and drank one a year. I noticed mellowing in the ale, but not in my palate. I could not get my mind open to this one. After the fifth, I gave the sixth away to a hop-head.    Bigfoot is on the "1001" list, but I still beg to differ.  Bigfoot also is reviewed in Roger Protz' CAMRA classic "300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"   MJ's 1990s review gave this 4 of 4 stars (maybe 2% in his "Guide' win 4 stars.)  Maybe, its me. I'll approach another Bigfoot differently.

T - caramel, chocolate, roasted barley, super pine hops. Slight sweetness up front but bitter pine finish    F - big beer. Velvety texture. Slight alcohol lingering in the tongue but balanced by the bitterness.    O - very bitter for a barleywine. 50/50 sweet and bitter.

The head is egg foam yellow and towering above the woody body.     On the label it talks about a lot of cone hops, but that's about all I smell when nosing this particular BW. This comes off more as a quadruple iPA in the aroma. Onion, grapefruit, garlic. Hits of caramel.     SN's Barleywine drinks like a hoppy, oily mess. I realize the American Barleywine style is hoppier than the English counterpart, but this is just a cop out. Dump a bunch of hops into the boil and use a touch of caramel malts along with the huge pale malt bill and there you have it. It's total vidalia onion, awful grapefruit, and a garbage-caramel gross sweetness. Awful.    I just can't quit disliking this beer. Feel is slick and oily, all the way down. Not boozy, not alcoholic, just a resiny mess.     Overall a very disconnected, one trick hop-blasted beer that drinks more like a super hop infused malt liquor. It's disgusting. I'll probably never return to this beer since it's turned me off so badly! To style? This beer is a fat ass F. It's an IPA if anything, and barleywine-ignorant-hopheads with scrubbed palates are the only reason this beer gets any credit.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Bottle dated 12/11/2015. I bought it on 2/11/2016. It took two months just to get to store shelves from Chico! DHF Snifter.    Appearance: Pours a brownish-red, with half a finger of light tan head that fades to islands of froth with a big bubbly mass of froth in the middle. Some carbonation visible, with a little haze and a little sediment. Lacing is modest, retention is pretty good for the style.    Smell: Immediate burst of hops, alcohol, and malt. Smells very sweet and chewy. Like an orange marmalade jelly donut. Hints of strawberry and caramel. Perhaps less hop here than I expected, but that is by no means a criticism.    Taste: Immediate sweetness on the arrival, turns to a hoppy malt center, then immediate taste of alcohol is present. Smooths out to a caramel and malty ending, then a firm bitterness that is not quite as medicinal as other American barleywines I've had. Finish carries some lingering resin and pine, but not nearly as potent as one might expect, and not unpleasant at all. More bitter/resiny and less fruity than Lagunitas Olde Gnarlywine.    Mouthfeel: Decidedly full-bodied, but not heavy. Remarkably clean, little slickness. Moderate carbonation.     Overall: This is what I was in the mood for, and this is what I got. The alcohol is strong on this one, but I imagine that will settle down with time - three in the cellar settling down. This is far more hop-forward than other strong ales or English barleywines I've had, but is also more drinkable than many. Very nice, and I look forward to seeing this develop.

Color is dark amber with slight haze. Smell is fruity and floral notes. Flavor is boozy (my first barleywine) with hoppy bitterness and malt sweetness hitting first then boozy. Will be getting more to age for summer enjoyment.    Just finishing my last 2016, 2.5 years later. More bitter on the aftertaste. Not as boozy, more caramel, with an earthy smell.

I enjoyed this very much. Will probably by my local pub out and try to cellar a few. (If i can abstain from indulging in this powerful and delicious beer.) I havent had a beer from Sierra Nevada that has dissapointed and this is the cream of the crop. Beer Noob opinion, will buy again (: love it!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 2016 Bottle...    Look has a dark, hazy copper body and khaki head that drops to a fat-rimmed film, leaving Jackson Pollock on the way down.    Smell is sweet dark fruits, candy caramel and piney hops.    Taste is candied fruits, malts and hoppy finish. Really complex, layered flavors that I can't really pin down, but it works really well.    Feel is full, sticky and lingering. Bitterness shows up late, but hangs on for a while.    Overall, this is easy to drink and a nice sweet treat to end the night. This is not something to session, and patience will payoff as it really opens up as it warms.

Sierra Nevada did a good job of creating a big bad barley wine thats not only palatable to people who don't normally drink this style but also keeping it at an affordable price...like always. good stuff

LOOK: Pours with a fingers worth of khaki foam that dissipates into a quarter fingers worth of off-white foam within 45 seconds. Ruby in color with a hint of cloudiness. Rising bubbles are medium in size and scarce in quantity. Lacing is thin and subtle.   SMELL: Strong aromas of piney hops, mangos, papaya, apricots, and peaches entangle with subtle caramel and plum aromas.   TASTE: The initial taste is a simultaneous bombardment of all the aromas, but as strong flavors. Unexpected and nearly overpowering, but my taste buds love it. Strong flavors of brown sugar (weren't detected in the smell) and mild flavors of bitter hops enter act 2 as mango, papaya, apricot, and peach flavors grow slightly stronger.  FEEL: Full-bodied and moderately carbonated. Goes down somewhat smooth while clinging to the back of the throat like syrup. Finishes horribly dry.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 For my first official Beer Advocate beer review, I’ve pulled out a special beer for a special occasion. This is the last 2013 Bigfoot Barleywine that I have been holding on to as my first attempt at cellaring/aging a beer. Thinking back to 2013 when I first bad this beer, I remember the strong and biting bitterness of the hops and warmth from the alcohol that overwhelmed my palate at the time. As time and experience with other beers have developed my palate, I am really looking forward to what time has done to this cornerstone of a beer for me. So here we go!  Look: 12 oz bottle poured semi-aggressively into a tulip glass, a beautiful rich mahogany red with two fingers of a light tan head, a few floaties that have settled from aging. Tight and pillowy at first, the head dissipates to a half inch of larger soapy bubbles in the center and creamy froth around the rim after about five minutes, leaving wonderful lacing.  Smell: Immediately caramel hits the nose, with very ripe dark fruits following. Hints of sweet raisins and port wine. Hardly any traces of citrus or piney hops. A completely different creature after 3 years.  Taste: Caramel, cream, vanilla, leather, dark candied fruits. Maybe a nice mild aromatic pipe tobacco? The booze is nowhere to be found in such a big beer compared to its younger self. Only slightly resinous with a hint of mature pine. Really a lovely sweetness like a fresh warm fruitcake. The perfect amount of sweetness and balanced bitterness.  Feel: So very smooth and creamy. Perfectly balanced and still a great medium carbonation. Such a soft and subtle bitterness that lingers on the middle and back of my tongue before disappearing like a dream. It coats the mouth and leaves a delicate bitterness aftertaste reminiscent of citrus, like subtle grapefruit pith.  Overall: One of the most lovely beers I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. The harsh bitterness and sharp edges from 2013 have smoothed and mellowed over time, making this a treat to enjoy on a stormy February evening. It is amazing what time can do to a beer. Being my first (and only at the moment) beer to have aged, I can’t wait to grab a few more bottles of various others to store away for another few years. While I would rate the young and raw version of this beer a 3.43, the 3 year aged version has blown me away beyond my expectations 5/5.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Just happened to have my computer while I was drinking a glass of this, so call it fate. Here goes my first official BeerAdvocate review.    Look: Gorgeous just barely off-white and silky head sits atop. About an inch of head and isn't going anywhere soon. The liquid a deep ruby with brown tones. This is a beautiful beer!    Smell: Some alcohol phenols and hops on the first sniff. Delve a little deeper and some dark fruits and maltiness pop up. Sweet and enticing aroma.    Taste: A complex one on the tastebuds. First hit is that fresh-hop bite. As it moves over the palate the sweetness opens up and dark fruits (raisins, plums, figs) come to mind. After-taste has it giving way to how big this beer is, although well-hidden, as it warms your body.    Feel: Moderate carbonation, just right for this beer. The mouthfeel is silky and smooth and dangerously drinkable for almost being 10%    Overall: Couldn't be happier having this beer as my first official BA-review. Just a lovely offering on the style, and you can't ask for much more with how available it is. Sierra Nevada after all these years is still making some excellent stuff. Happy to store a few bottles each year to see how they age and develop.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25 Has a moderately light brown color, with a almost non-existent head.     Smells of sweet malts, subtle tones of citra, and dried fruits.     Taste is surprisingly subtle. There are clear notes of pine, grainy sweetness, dried fruit, and grapefruit. But for the most part, this is an incredibly drinkable barleywine. Almost intimating so for being 9.6%. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and it has a distinctly creamy body.    I have to admit that this is very much still a style I'm growing accustomed to. Yet, every sip of this makes me long for more. This is an absolutely incredible beer, which combines the malty characteristics of most American strong ales, with the nuance and sweetness of a juicy harvest IPA. This is cool.

Very dark amber to almost mahogany in a appearance. Great carbonation when you rock the glass from side to side. Leaves alcohol legs down the glass. Spotty lacing.  AROMA: Floral, alcohol, sherry, port wine like. Brown sugar, a little citrus, dark dried fruit, and some bready malts.  TASTE: Sherry like. Dried fruits, and bready...like fruitcake. Bitter citrus rind. Very wine like. Good blend of sweet and bitter.  MOUTHFEEL: Very dry all the way through the sip. Very good carbonation, not overkill.   OVERALL: A very nice sipper. Has a very pleasant taste that reminds me of sipping a fine sherry or dessert wine, but that carbonation really helps bring out the flavors.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. - Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale. 9.6% ABV. 12oz bottle into a snifter. 2015 edition.    Look: Body is a rich amber hue, with a two finger tan head from an aggressive pour.    Smell: Floral hops balanced by sweet malts, with some tones of caramel, sour fruits, and molasses.    Feel: Medium bodied with a lot of carbonation, while still being pretty smooth.    Taste: Sweet malts and sour fruits up front, but soon drowned out by bitter hops and caramel, which all blend into the aftertaste. Some minor alcohol taste is present, without being boozy, and without burning.    Overall: This is my first Barleywine style of beer, without being barrel aged. Pretty enjoyable, with a great balance of bitter hops and sweet malts. The ABV of this beer is concealed pretty well, although still noticeable.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bottle into a snifter.    L: Pours a clear deep ruby mahogany color. Thick creamy off-white head with delicate lacing.    S: Brown sugar and molasses mingling with piney hops.    T/F: Malty and smooth... caramel, brown sugar, and raisins. Strong hop presence so fits right in with the West Coast barleywine's. Evergreen and mild citrus. Creamy on the mouthfeel and warming. High ABV and it shows... but enough balance to keep it tasteful.    O: A big west coast barleywine that stacks up with the best of them. Great for a cold winter night and looking forward to seeing what a year in the cellar does for this guy. Great beer from a top-notch brewery.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Pours reddish brown, long lasting tan head. Tastes of deep malts, sweet biscuit, toasty, with well hidden alcohol. Another solid Bigfoot. 
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours deep red caramel color with thick tan head that lasts forever excellent lacing.    Smell - Big hop notes some sweet malts I get a little grapefruit as well.    Taste - good hop flavors the alcohol is well hidden malts show through as well also getting the pine bitter a little.    Feel - medium bodied little dry very smooth little burn from the alcohol and bitterness but in a good way.    Overall an amazing beer I will have many more times.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Pours a cloudy, ruddy brown with thin tan head. Aroma is fantastic - malty with booze and a touch of piney hop. Flavor has a more pronounced bitter that takes the forefront, with slight malt sweetness almost balancing. I find this just a little rough on the palette between the bitter and the booze, but the liquid is very smooth, low carbonation, and slightly cloying - all of which I enjoy.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours ruby red with a thick, 4" frothy cream colored head. Incredible lacing and great retention.    Nose is hop, malt, caramel, vanilla, and booze.     Flavor is just a spot on america barleywine. That perfect balance of huge bitter with massive sweetness - warming boozy note works perfectly.     Feel is fantastic - carbonation level doesn't add too much bitterness, appropriately lifts this dense brew off the palate. Finish is long on the bitter which just makes the next sip happen faster.    This is a fantastic beer - for the price and availability it's nearly impossible to beat. Those aspects factor into the high marks but it truly is a world class brew.

Clear dark amber with a one-finger head that dissipated in a few minutes but regenerated with each swirl. Potent fragrance filled the air around the glass at once to a radius of several feet.  Flavor dominated by the piney element in the Chinook hops, which floated over the malt base without integrating with it. Will appeal to those who appreciate prominent Pacific northwest hops.  Weighty mouthfeel, beverage coated the throat.  Overpowered the homemade burrito I paired it with, but it was nice with a dessert of Medjool dates. Sweetness of the dates took some edge off the hoppiness and brought out the malt.

Taste is sweet, malt, rich bread and then to hops and slightly bitter finish and feint abv bite. The hops have held on surprisingly well after 13 months of cellaring; it'll be fun to see how much they hold on after a while longer. The mouth is fantastic--smooth, creamy, very nicely carbonated.

Clear caramelish red/brown in the glass. Smells of sweet caramel malt, pine and citrus, nice in your face with the malt. Taste is sweet caramel malt with pine sap and citrus. As it warms you get more of the citrus coming out, grapefruit is there, some of the alcohol is peeking out too. Creamy in the middle with a big bitter dry tannic finish. This reminds me of drinking a good cab. Man that bitterness stays with you, really tames out the sweetness on this beer.

T: Toffee and caramel cream flavors open up to a cherry and grape fruitiness. Ends with some hop bitterness even after a year in the bottle.  M: Medium-full.  O: Nice. Hop flavor still preserved, but great malt flavors as well.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Wow, SN never ceases to amaze me.    L: Pours a rich, dark reddish caramel color, like coca cola. Two-fingers of thick, luscious, toasted cream-colored head, which builds slowly and lasts well, leaving rather attractive cocoa-colored lacing. A beautiful brew.    S: Molasses, caramel, alcohol, candied dark fruit (Plum, raspberry, cherry, etc), toasted rye bread, and a nutty whole-grain scent; a little hint of piney hops, and a clean grapefruit rind presence.    T: Those bitter hoppy flavors are much more noticeable, with the avalanche of malty, caramelly, toasty sweetness cascading over the bitter skeleton, fleshed out with a sugary blackberry-jam-on-toast flavor. Almost just like a stout, but missing the coffee and chocolate. Definitely something I enjoyed immensely. I would pair with any pastry, or a rich stew, or simply cheese and crackers.    F: Someone commented that the mouthfeel was a little thin. I'm rather blown away by this comment, as it seems as thick as could be possibly expected for the ABV. A lot like Torpedo IPA, but thicker and bitterer.    O: Excellent. If this is any sort of example, I'd say barleywines are definitely a thing I enjoy. Glad to encounter this magnificent brew and I hope to find more of its kind in the future!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 12 oz bottle with a packaged date of 01/28/15. Sipped from a tulip by a bonfire just shy of a year later. May not have actually aged for the full year as was bought cold about a week ago, so who knows how long it actually spent out of refrigeration.    L: Pours a slightly hazy deep orange-red with yellow highlights, which transforms into an absolutely gorgeous ruby red by firelight. Active carbonation leaves a thin but persistent ring of off-white head leaving reasonably sticky lacing on par for the hoppiness and ABV.    S: Sugary caramel malts and grapefruity citrus hops are the primary aromatic notes, along with a healthy dose of pine. Alcohol is present in the nose and increases as the beer warms. I'm also detecting a bit of a burnt wood quality, but I am fairly certain that's just the bonfire...    T: Sweet and malty, as a barleywine should be. Grapefruit, lemon, pine, and a light whole-cone grassiness from the hops, and in good quantity; this is unlikely to have sat anywhere near room temperature for an appreciable time over this past year. Astringent bitterness persists throughout the taste and the alcohol is quite noticeable but not overly harsh, especially considering how relatively young this bottle is. Some fruity esters and phenolic components are detectable but kept in check. A mild barrel-like quality on the backend alongside lingering pine resin.    F: Medium-bodied and a bit on the watery side for a barleywine. Hopefully will thicken with some aging. Carbonation is solid and prickly, giving the dominant hops a good kick in the cones.    O: This is a solid barleywine and not bad for a young specimen. Looking forward to seeing what a little age will do to this beer, especially considering the relatively light mouthfeel, fairly strong alcohol presence, and boisterous hop intensity. The rest of the four pack is already put away in the "cellar", and I may just grab another quartet to join them before the imminent 2016 release.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Pours a deep orange amber color with a 2 finger tan head that lasts, beautiful.  Smells more like an ipa, fresh pine and citrus notes dominate, slight toffee notes.  Starts with sweet malt, toffee, caramel, then dank hops grow stronger towards the finish, which is dry.  Mouthfeel is full with little carbonation, dry.  Overall good, as are all Sierra Nevada beers I've ever had but underwhelming to me, as I experienced little complexity here, however it isn't boozy at all, so points there.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 2015 - bottled 12/11/14 and i've had in my fridge for between 2-3 months.  2016- bottled 12/4/15 and i picked up 2 4packs in early Januar i think.  2014-bottled 1/12/14. bought it in March 2016 at $8.99 a 4pack. 2 in the fridge and 2 in the basement.  2017 - bottled 12/14/16. bought it in October 2017    pours a deep mahogany with a thick head. with more age it looks much more like cider.    smell is sweet, nice balanced aroma. solid aroma, nice mix of malt and hops. not overly sweet but a nice subtle sweetness.     great taste, great balance of sweetness and bitterness. finishes bitter and dry but somehow different than an IPA finish. smooth and easy drinking.     REVIEW OF 2016 fresh Bigfoot (bottled 12/4/15 and in my fridge for a few months now, it's 3/21/16):  -certainly more bold than the 11 month old 2015, this certainly mellows with age. which is why i bought 2 4packs, 1 for now and 1 for later. also my local store was selling 2014 Bigfoot for the same price as 2016 Bigfoot so i picked it up to test out.  -the hops are much more prevalent than the aged barleywine, a nice strong ale almost Brown Shugga flavor to it.     2014: much more mellow. looks like cider. very malty yet has subtle and beautiful hop flavor. and has an amazing flavor. this is amazing with age, holy shit. i'm keeping my 2016 bottles in my cellar for a while now. slight char to it as well. really fantastic.    i am enjoying this! a great barleywine. a great balance, i enjoy the combination this beer has between sweetness and bitterness. almost has a slight barrel taste to it. a great beer, my new favorite barleywine.    2017, less than a year from bottling.  Still amazing, just a truly great yet easy to find beer.

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Poured aggressively into a Duvel tulip. Bottle dated 12/04/14.    Look -- Three fingers of tight light khaki head reduce to a single finger that lingers. It has nice lacing and the color of the body of the beer is a slightly murky deep amber.    Smell -- Resinous hop aroma with very faint hints of grapefruit in the back. Caramel sweetness coming through and absolute no hint of booze. I'm sure the hops have faded since the beer is a year old but there is still plenty left in the tank.    Taste -- Similar to the nose, resinous hops with faint grapefruit, caramel, and lots of bitterness. The booze hides once again.    Feel -- Low carbonation, possibly partial due to the aggressive pour, and a medium body. It has heft without being cloying. It's just a delight to sip on feeling wise.    Overall -- A nice hoppy barelywine that has aged just fine. It hide the boozes like a ninja so combined with how sippable it is it could easily sneak up on you if you weren't prepared. Overall it's just a damn nice barleywine.

Superb head retention and gorgeous lacing.    S: Toasted caramel and piney, grapefruity hops. While the taste is still on point, the aroma seems a bit faded from the year in the cellar.    T: Very hop-forward with just enough malt to balance it out. Classic American C-variety hops bursting with grapefruit and pine. Long bitter finish.    F: Medium-full, creamy. Medium carbonation which adds to the creamy mouthfeel. Practically no perceptible booze.     Overall: SN Bigfoot is a beer that can never possibly get old for me – it is simply an American classic and one of my personal favorites. Frankly, this is a brew that every self-identifying beer geek needs to try at least once. Fresh, aged, Bigfoot is superb.

Alcohol completely covered. Aftertaste is malty, and earthy/grapefruit hops. Leaves a coating for sure.  O - full on awesome barley wine. A year on this really pushes it over the edge to awesomeness. I'd by 10 4 packs of this at this age if I could find it. Bottled 12/11/14 drank 12/12/15.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 This one looks ruby in the glass, only a half finger of head but the foam is very fine pored and strong. Really fruity on the nose!...red fruits, dark fruits, mhh some cane sugar, bubble gum, mango, very hoppy and bitter in the scent. Smells also alcoholic, but more on the sweet side..like honey, forest-herbs, and even.... like a Martini! As I drink, I definately taste all these aromes, very sweet bitter, woody, and fruity. Vermouth. Very warming in the finish, with a long lasting bitter note. Wohww. That bitter note is really special for a barleywine style beer! Very fascinating!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 The hop bite lasts quite long in this beer, months in even. The malt balances it out after a sip or two, but it remains less sweet than many barleywines. This adds to the (dangerous) drinkability of this beer

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Serving: 2015 release. 12 oz bottle ("pkgd 12/11/14"), poured into a 9 oz Libbey Embassy snifter.    Appearance: Slightly hazy orange copper color with tan, bubbly head; light lacing.    Smell: Malt and deep, dark fruit together with alcohol notes (figs soaked in grappa). Citrus and earthy hops in the background.    Taste: Intense malt and hops play against each other. Big malt body with toasted grains, caramel, dried fruit and even faint cocoa notes. Balancing bitterness throughout with citrus rind and herbal hops.    Mouthfeel: Medium to full body, almost sticky, with moderate but gentle carbonation.    Overall: Big and powerful, plenty of complex matinees, while so well balanced by hops and bitterness.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 I purchased a six pack of the 2012 Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale from Once Upon a Vine in Richmond, Virginia, on April 6, 2012. What followed was a worthwhile test of patience. After three and a half years later, this ale is absolutely superb.     A (4.75): Poured into a tulip glass. Cloudy red amber color with a creamy white head tinged with the slightest bit of honey gold at its edges. The head dissipates quickly, leaving almost no lacing. When held to a light, the ale glows a rusty orange.    S (5.00): Incredibly complex. While pouring, the ale surprises you with a strong malty sweetness with a good bit of cherry and spice. Upon further nosing, the hops that have been subdued over the past few years become evident; mostly piney but with the ever slightest hint of citrus. Alcohol hides behind candied fruit and honey, which certainly take center stage, starting (again) with cherry and working through raspberry and raisin to a sweet almost chocolaty allspice aroma. Everything is subtle and balanced.    T (4.75): Fruit tartness is offset by a molasses sweetness. The taste is flat compared to the smell, but isn't disappointing. More candied fruit that turns into malty sweetness after warming. Molasses lingers on the tongue.    M (5): Take the first sip quickly before the head dissipates for an incredibly smooth and creamy feel that dissolves into a slight dryness. The ever slightest bit of carbonation appear on the roof the mouth but not on the tongue. After the ale settles, there's a viscosity to it that doesn't offend, like very thin syrup.    O (4.875): I wholeheartedly suggest cellaring this ale for at least 18 months. I haven't done a vertical, and I'm not sure how much longer it would have held on after 3.5 years, but it's definitely fantastic after some time to balance and mellow out.

M: Rich, surprisingly high carbonation.    O: Just like SN Stout (enjoyed earlier today), they use juuuust slightly more hops than normal to keep the classic flavor but add a new, tasty, challenging twist. Warm, buttery, malty, caramel, touch of hop kick. Yum.

Smell: Candy, pine, small amount of hops, caramel.    Taste: Was slightly disappointed in the taste based on the smell. Very good but was expecting more. Dark fruit (plums), caramel, and toffee. Maybe a hint of citrus.    Feel: Well carbonated, hides the ABV well.    Overall: A very good barleywine. Definitely the base-line for what a good barleywine should be.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This is the 2015 vintage. I have to admit that I just don't care for the overpowering hop bitterness when it is fresh. I cellared the other 3 from my 4 pack. However I resampled this beer with almost a year of age on it and it improves significantly. The initial hop bitterness which I did not care for is still present, just in a much more subdued and muted way. The malt is allowed to come out into the forefront. Much more enjoyable. The remaining two will continue to be cellared until I revisit them later.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 This was my first time with Barleywine. Poured into a snifter glass. Edit:had been sitting in the dark part of my favorite liquor store for about 8-9 months, which are decently close to cellaring conditions.  Look: Absolutely stunning color. It's a deep red amber. Fine, smallish head that leaves sticky laces on the glass as I drink. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is easily one of the most attractive beers I've ever seen. Love the presentation; the cap  Smell: Candy of some sort? Fruits. Good or bad, alcohol presence is there.   Taste: Lives up to its name. Tastes like fruit (plum?), with an aftertaste of wine. Big hop presence, but not bitter at all, and it definitely doesn't detract from the other flavors. There's a lot here in the malts. Listed as 90 IBU, which surprised me. Very rich and balanced, with both sweet and bitter flavors.  Feel: medium just on the border of heavy bodied. Sticky, clinging finish that makes you want to drink it slow. Considering the abv, this is a good thing.  Overall: I did some research, and apparently these are in a similar category to the "winter warmer", which is by far my favorite style. This lived up to my expectations of being its more bitter, stronger cousin. Definitely going to be my go-to for cold weather drinking. I'm afraid of what it will taste like fresh (too much hops?)

Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, piney hops.  Tastes pretty good. Bitter pine up front with a strong caramel sweetness on the end; burnt sugar.   Full mouth feel, long lingering bitterness overlaps the caramel toffee sweetness.  Overall, this is a great beer, now that's not to say I will be searching it out again; it's that caramel sweetness and that over-steeped tea bag flavor that old D/IPA's get. Just not a fan of that flavor profile. Not a drain pour, just not my cup of tea, no pun intended.

Big sweet burnt caramel and candied orange notes in the aroma, earthy and spicy pine hoppiness, hint of something darker, cocoa maybe? Nice feel going down. Sweet, mouth coating, well balanced without being cloying. Toffee/Caramel on the taste, candied citrus/pine hops, toasted malts, and some dark fruit just started to peak through.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12oz. 2015 vintage (bottled 2/11/2015): 7 months old to date. I had this right after trying the Lagunitas Gnarlywine at about the same age.    Poured a nice frothy head (similar to Gnarlywine), with a light amber color. Has a lot going on in the aroma: alcohol, malts, dark fruit, and something else I like--and haven't found in any other beer--perhaps mint. Mouth-feel is light to medium. Lots of the flavors I find typical in barleywines: sweetness, dark fruits, not too much on the hoppy side, with a little bitterness in the finish (not in the Gnarlywine).     I have read lots about this barleywine in terms of it being a classic to cellar, so I have been looking forward to trying it with a bit of age on it.     In general, I like both Bigfoot and Gnarlywine. I really like the aroma of Bigfoot (a little better than Gnarlywine), but the flavor of this beer seems a little too much--too strong, too intense--at the moment, which I believe is commonly termed as 'too hot'. My guess is in another year or two the flavor will mellow out and surpass the flavor of Gnarlywine; but only time will tell, as I have a number of both currently cellaring.

Thin lacing that dissappears very quickly. Smells of light alcohol, bitterness and pine fallowing a very bitter taste with light alcohol. Good beer to bust out of a occasion in winter but not a every day drinker. I'll be holding onto my last 2015 and trying it next winter.

For a beer that is supposed to be overly hop forward, I get more sweet malts and dark fruit like dates, figs, raisins and a good amount of sweetness. The alcohol shows up at the finish. As the beer warms, the dark fruits, toffee, and caramel becomes more pronounced. This bottle was nine months old. I am going to cellar the remaining three bottles for two years and might reserve another bottle for three years. Very good beer. I prefer English Barleywines, but this one surprised me.

Caramel and bread malt notes dominate.  Feel = 4.0 Medium to high carbonation with a full bodied, thick, syrupy and resiny feel; some fizz on the tongue.  Drinkability = 3.0 Big booziness and intense bitterness has to detract from the drinkability somewhat.

This is THE barleywine. It’s a classic, and a standard of the style. Pours a wonderful warm malty-amber with a boquet that changes over time… from a orange/citrusy hop kick to a light toffee/toasted coconut. Big malt backing that develops toffee and chocolate notes over time as well, complementing the citrusy piney hop profile.    I’ve had this fresh and I’ve had this aged and I love it either way. Just don’t drink it out of the bottle, ok?

Initially an emphatic malt sweetness, but the hops bitterness (kind of like chewing on a bitter orange peel) kicks in almost immediately thereafter. But wait: that's followed by a caramel sweetness, and THAT'S followed by a piney, resinous finish. There's so much going on taste-wise that you don't even notice the alcohol (but trust me - it's there). Thick, sticky mouthfeel; moderate carbonation. Hoppier than I think a barleywine ought to be, but still very drinkable.

The citrus and floral notes are present but for me a bit too much in the background. Overall a very enjoyable and respectable barley wine.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I had been meaning to try this beer for a while as an avid Sierra Nevada fan. I should have tried it sooner as it is excellent. It does pack a powerful 9.6% ABV so be careful, but it is quite drinkable for such a strong brew and remember it is after all a barely wine. And lastly, this particular bottle pack that I picked up was almost 8 months cellared, so take that into account as you consider my review.     Look-It pours a reddish copper dark amber color that glints in the light with molten golden color hues. The head is delicate and quickly dissipates due to the sugar content. The lacing is also almost nonexistent, but that is to be expected. The color more than makes up for the lack of those other attributes.    Smell-It has a complex and strong malt-forward smell with yeast components as well as molasses, toffee, caramel, spices, pine, and maybe some bread pudding.    Taste-The hops are definitely present, but are equally balanced by a plethora of sweet dark fruits like candied cherry, plums, and smoked cedar. I also get walnuts and a nutty spice that reminds me of Christmas. The hops shine through strongest at the end with a heavy pine resin and maybe some clementine or grapefruit.    Mouthfeel-It is quite heavy, but not overwhelming and mildly syrupy with little carbonation. You get a sticky oil feeling that lingers like a hoppy resin at the end. It drinks so crisply for a powerful 9.6% brew and is really easy to finish.     Overall-This brew is excellent and belongs in front of a fancy movie scene which features a log cabin in the middle of the woods in a blizzard with a man holding a crystal goblet filled with this variety sitting in front of a big fireplace in a red leather chair perched upon a bear rug while absent-mindedly petting a bloodhound and smoking a Cuban cigar.

LOOK: Clear, lightly reddish brown with a thin finger of off white head that leaves some lacing.     SMELL: Generically speaking, big complex malt and yeast aromas mixed with a big hop presence. Individually, I can smell molasses, caramel, toffee, some spices, tons of pine, and a hint of grapefruit and raisins. On to the taste!    TASTE: A massive intermingling of hops and malt. Caramel, toffee, brown sugar, toasted coconut, walnuts, gingerbread, and fruit cake galore, but kept in check by just enough bitterness. There's a rich, dark fruit presence--some cherries, plums, and raisins. Finishes hoppy with heavy pine and grapefruit. I love it!    FEEL: Medium-heavy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a sticky hop oil aftertaste. Drinks incredibly easy for 9.6% ABV.    OVERALL: I love this beer! I'm glad my first trying a barleywine was a good experience. This beer is both heavy as all get out, yet quite easy to drink at the same time. Simultaneously super malty and super hoppy. Complex and flavorful. This beer will definitely see my fridge again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Grabbed a single 12 oz bottle as part of a mixed pack at my local Stein's Liquor. This one was packaged about six months ago. Poured at cellar temperature into my tulip glass.    L: Pours a deep burnt sienna with about two inches of dense tan head that persists for a good long while and leaves very nice lacing on the glass. Moderate visible carbonation at the edges where the light shines through.    S: Caramel and toasted malts are front and center. There are also nice notes of raisin, stone fruit, citrus rind, and pine. Just a little clear alcohol coming through. Very nice, if not especially assertive, bouquet.    T: Caramel and toasted malts provide a sweet initial flavor. The hops introduce themselves quite early, providing grapefruit rind and pine notes to complement the malts. In the middle there's also a development of some nice fruit flavors, including raisin, dried stone fruit, and pineapple. The back end is characterized by resinous hop flavor--grapefruit rind and pine. These bring a ton of bitter to the back end, though there is enough of the malts to keep them somewhat in check. Just a touch of clear alcohol at the close.    F: Medium-bodied, though perhaps not quite as heavy as would be expected from the style. Creamy and bright in turns. This one definitely has a bit of stick to it, but it's not overtly syrupy. Lots of lingering bitter on the palate from this one.    O: Having had a few very good barleywines, I was surprised to find this one as hop-forward as it is. Being a big fan of hops, I don't have much of a complaint, but I just don't think this one is quite well-representative of the style. That being said, it's delicious and well-worth a try.

It's very hoppy for a barleywine and doesnt hold up to the best beers in the style today. However, i have to put into consideration that this was first brewed in 1983. As others have mentioned, this reminds me more of an imperial red ale. If labeled as such, id easily give this a 4.5. As a barleywine, its closer to a solid 4. Very enjoyable nonetheless

Aroma: Strong, complex and delicious aromas of toasted malt, candied sugar, dried stone fruit such as apricots, plumbs and nectarines, as well as honey, spices of black pepper, saffron, coriander and a touch of ginger. There is also a touch of floral, piney, hops.    Taste: With two years age on it, it tastes very nice and complex! Tons of roasted malt and candied sugar up front, followed by the aforementioned spices of black pepper, saffron, coriander, ginger, as well as touches of nutmeg and all-spice. There is also quite a bit of the aforementioned dried stone fruit such as apricots, plumbs and nectarines, and finally, the beer finishes with some piney, floral, slightly resin-like, slightly bitter hops, but nothing out of balance or too assertive to muddle the other flavors. It’s a beautifully balanced beer!    Mouthfeel: Slightly chewy and pretty smooth as there is just a touch of carbonation. With an ABV of 9.6%, there is just a touch of an alcohol warmth on the palate, otherwise the alcohol is very well masked.    Overall: This was drunk with two years age on it, and it’s a very nice, very good American-style barley wine. Great flavors, nicely balanced hops. Great quaff!

Excellent retention the head lingers for quite awhile. Lacing is intense and beautiful on the glass.    S: Raisin, pine, caramel, and floral earthy hops.    T: Sweet malts, white pepper, molasses, raisins, apricot, with some nice earthy hop bitterness on the back end.    M: Medium bodied, lightly carbonated, smooth, peppery and bitter.

Ruby red color at first gives way to a caramel/amber color.    S -- Raisin is the first scent I got, followed by floral hops. Nothing strong or overwhelmingly awesome, but pleasant nonetheless.     T -- Peppery malts and baked fruit. The hop flavor comes through strong, especially towards the end of the sip, as it warms. Got a bit of resin flavor on the tongue occasionally.     F -- Smooth, a bit of zing on the tongue from the peppery flavor.     O -- Great to drink, but nothing that blew my socks off.

After 5 years, this beer comes together nicely. Still well carbonated and with a one finger beige head. Lots of clingy lacing.  Lots of alcohol and spice still in the aroma. Stone fruits and malts back it up.  Malty with stone fruit coming to the front. Plums, dates and raisins. Spicy finish with a strong bite from the alcohol.  Smooth mouth feel, medium heavy body with medium carbonation.

The taste is very malty, heavy, sweet up front, but then very spicy, clove, pine resin, sticky, but ends bitter dry.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 This is a solid Barleywine Ale. The color is a deep amber with a tan head giving forth to a bouquet of floral aromatics. As the deep amber liquid strikes the palate it yeals flavors of malty and a hint of sweetness due to left over malt sugars witch is quickly balanced with hop bitterness with the finish of hoppy radiance and floral tones.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Purchased 8 Vintage 2015 in February/March. Plan on aging them and then adding onto this review once a year, as aroma and palate evolve.    05/02/15 Review:    Served at about 55°. Pours a deep, dark, semi-opaque copper capped with tapioca-colored head. Retention wasn't great, but that could just be the result of the glassware (snifter). Filming lace, on the other hand, was magnificent, sticking to the sides of the glass as well as the surface of the beer. Yeast dancing around the bottom of the glass. Hop aromas are sweet citrus, perfume, pine, and resin. Can't detect much from the grain on the nose. Caramel probably melds too much with hops, although perhaps the slightest toastiness is there. Sweet, caramel malt, some yeast character, and strong, dank fruity/floral hops in the lead. Overall, raisin-like, but bitter. Just as soon as you think these are sure bets, piney and spicy bitterness overtake them. Herbal, rindy notes and black pepper are hot on their heels as they lap and finish. Retro-olfaction brings out crushed mustard seed. A thin, metallic tasting lining of the mouth is soon all that remains. Very smooth, full-bodied, astringent and warming, with medium carbonation. A year is a long time to wait for another tasting.    05/02/16 Review:    May 2016: Served just over 60°, using same snifter. Copper with peach tones, semi-clear but hazy, thick, and dark with fine suspended particles. Beige, rocky, but even and creamy head of moderate retention. Alright lacing. Resin, raisin, pleasant perfume, spicy dankness, pepper, hot alcohol. Hops seem to have deteriorated somewhat, not a bad thing as long as booze, malt, and carbonation do their jobs. Pine, perfume, raisin, apricots to palate. Caramel with dark fruity, spirity sweetness and mild tea/leaf/leather-like bitterness throughout, with the addition of cloves and peppercorn come the finish. Medium-bodied, too well-carbonated to be syrupy, fine and tingly then creamy-smooth, plenty warming, and yet not as hot as expected. Looking forward to trying the 2015 again in another year (and 5 more after that, started with 8). Missed the 2016 so far this year, but I could still get lucky. Not as good as it was before (going by memory and past description) due to hop deterioration, but perhaps in another year or so that won’t be as much of an issue. Though I will keep my first score, for the sake of discussion, I would re-score this at 4.75, 4, 4.25, 4.5, 4.25. Improvement only in mouthfeel, with hop flavors and aromas deteriorating slightly as they would in an IPA or IIPA. Still plenty of room for improvement, as malt and yeast qualities age on alcohol in the years to come.    04/08/17 Review:    Last reviewed this, same vintage, almost a year ago and I still have a few more I will age even longer.      Deep dark copper, almost ruby, semi-opaque with heavy swirls of sediment and haze. Tight, sticky, wispy, foamy tan head of good retention. Dark fruit, berries, resin, wood, caramel, slight grain aromas. Palate is extreme! Hops are deteriorated, but subdued and good in the balance, perfumey if anything and all but losing themselves once the spicy booze has kicked in. Other than that we have plenty of dark fruit and a little toffee as well as some soil and strong woody flavor, which with the caramel and related malt notes approaches maple syrup, but thankfully not as sweet. Retro-olfaction is peppery at first but then you’re hit with a surprise of tropical and fortified wine qualities. While I would normally recommend such a hot beer in sips, you can actually avoid saturating your palate significantly by taking gulps here, although you may regret it later. Medium-bodied, but a bit lighter than expected. Warm, but deceptively cool for almost 10% ABV. Extra fine medium levels of carbonation, almost effervescence, gulpable, not sharp at all. Hard to compare, especially after two years, but this seems like it is slightly better than it is fresh, probably because I generally prefer what yeast does to what hops do, and the right threshold was met in 2017, albeit not in 2016. New score would be: 4.75, 4.5, 4.25, 4.75, and 4.5, but as always, I will keep the original.

S - Tons of subtle hop aroma, mostly berry and pine,    T - Hits hard with a mixture of fruity and resiny hops, along with a fat, roasty malt body completely undetected by the nose. The hops step back for a moment and let the malts shine, ending with a nice spice and oh so slight residual bitterness.    M - Almost stoutlike, very heavy body with very light carbonation. Fairly dry.    O - Very easy to sip, but if you're paying attention, all of the elements play together wonderfully. A very subtle creation by SN.

Alcohol, hop aroma, and IBU presence were all muted. Solid but not outstanding as compared with other examples in this style. Maybe I'll shelf the rest of the 4-pack for a year but I gather that will only dull the allready muted flavors.

Big cream and foam slightly tan or off white head. Sticky lace retains through ought.  Lots of complexity in the aroma. There are dark fruit in the nose as well as a sweet caramel, toffee and molasses type aroma. Later, there is some biscuity malt with a whiff of alcohol on the backend. Later still, some resiny oily hops come to the forefront.  This brew is in many ways a tale of two palates. As with the aroma, at first the fruity and malty sweetness are felt on both the tongue and the finish. The feel is viscous, medium bodied to full and almost buttery. However, the big hops bittering and flavoring provide a resiny and even citric feel. The alcohol is also there although not to the point of being too boozy.   This is a great beer.

Served in a goblet. 2015 vintage    Appearance: clear copper with a white head that sank to a thin one on the top of the beer.     Nose: flowery, toffee and caramel, fresh hop aroma    Taste: hop bite, slightly bitter, heavy malt body, no alcohol in the front but there is a warming fusal alcohol taste in the back. Bitter grapefruit when it warmed up.     Overall: I bought this beer for its cellar strength. I can definitely see how this would improve over the next few years. I have 7 more and will update this in a few months.    4/25/2016  2016 vintage served in a teku  Very pronounced hop character, bitter grapefruit, dank and delicious. More like a strong DIPA than a Barleywine. Hot and a bit boozy this year. Very taste paired with grilled vegetables and pork marinated in Lewis' family sauce.

My favorite year.  2014 - hops not overpowering and taste lasts on palate.   2015 - Strong on the hops, a great taste but aging would definitely help it. As aging this beers always does. This has the darkest color for some reason out of the three.   
look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Wow! How things change. A couple years ago, I thought this beer was the "bees knees." Now, though I still feel this is a very good beer, I'm not quite so in love with it. Here's why.    For me, this has way too much of a hop presence for a barleywine. I generally LOVE hops in things like IPA's. But for me, a barleywine should be minimally hoppy and its focus should be on flavors like sherry and bourbon and fruit. This particular beer is hop-infused throughout. As such, it tastes to me more like an IPA. A GOOD IPA - but an IPA nonetheless.    I don't know if the formula for this beer has changed, or if it's my taste buds. I suspect the latter.    This is a very good IPA. But, to my taste buds, it's really not a barleywine.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 The beer pours a nice white and bubbly head that dissipates but still leaves a nice film on the head and inside of the glass. The beer itself is a beautiful reddish deep amber that is very clear. The look is pretty gorgeous.    The beer smell is fairly fruity and hoppy with a bit of sweetness to it. The hops are more a light pine and citrus smell than anything. The malt smell is fairly sweet and fruity.    The beer taste is strongly hopped. The hops are mainly pine with a bit of citrus to it. The malt is strongly overshadowed by the ops but still manages to squeeze a tea and fruity flavor from it.    The mouthfeel is heavy but on the lighter side. The beer goes down smoothly. The beer is lightly carbonated and gives a nice tingling feel on the tongue.    Overall, a very good barleywine despite how hopped it is. Even though the ops are strong, the taste is not bad and the strong malts do help take the edge off little.

It never used to be a style I enjoyed, but my palate has evolved to enjoy them much more. This one, however, did not leave me particularly impressed. Mostly sweet, but not with any real flavor behind it. Everything blended into an amalgam that rather than being balanced was simply dull. I can more easily forgive a beer being outright bad than I can dull.    Edit - boy have my tastes changed. I saw this and wanted to update to my current views. I now drink this beer often and adore it. Deep resinous pine, sweet rich brown sugar, caramel, burnt citrus peels, mild spices. Just an amazing beer, even better with 5 years on it.

A nice amount of carbonation can be seen rising up the beer.    Smell - 3.75/5  A lot of resinous hops with some pine as well. A little bit of darker malt sugars. This is a barleywine-style ale, but it smells a little too hoppy from other instances of the style I've tried.    Taste - 3.75/5  Some major resin and pine flavors come in full force the first sip. Yet there is little bitterness. Rather, a mellowed out version of the flavor, very smooth. The malts are more discernable in the taste than they were in the smell. Still, I feel that the hop flavors are definitely dominant in the beer. Not exactly what I'm looking for in a barleywine, but I guess the hops is to be expected, given Sierra Nevada. It's not bad, just tastes more like a DIPA than a barleywine.    Mouthfeel - 4/5  This beer definitely drinkes super smooth, which is nice. Medium bodied, with a lighter amount of light-medium intensity carbonation.    Overall - 3.75/5  Overall, not a bad beer, just more hoppy than I like my barleywines.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Deep auburn with thin off white head. Aromas of bourbon barrel staves, semi sweet malt as liquid warms. Bourbon and boozy malt with burnt hop finish - intense. Medium mouthfeel, tongue tingles with alcohol, and bittering coating. Overall, tastes a little lite, like it needs time, but still big and boozy. Nice.

The 2009-2012 had quite a biscuity flavor that the 2013-2015 didn't have.    The 2009-2011 had a hint of caramel along with the biscuity flavor.    Each year got a little hazier the older it was.    Each year still had plenty of carbonation.

Probably shouldn't have because I felt like Laguintas was superior and took the funk out of.it. I'd buy it again to readjust my palate but don't see it getting anything higher than a 4

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I could have sworn I rated this years ago, but apparently not. I chose to drink a fresh one to rate instead of an aged bottle. I get some malt in the nose with a hoppy edge to it. Taste swaps malt for the initial blast of earthy, dank hops which gives way to sweetness once the malt comes around. Virtually no heat on it while drinking or during finish.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Bottled on 12/18/2014. Sampled and reviewed on March 2, 2015.    Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a New Belgium snifter. Pours a dark amber/hazy ruby color with lots of bubbles. 2 finger off-white head of sticky foam. Smells of malt, raisins, grapefruit, honey, with a slight hoppiness. Mouthfeel is quite dense, almost like a stout. Taste is bitter hops, caramel, bready malt, and grapes/raisins. I should add that as this beer warmed up, it became much more malt-forward when it hit my tongue. Very interesting evolution in a short amount of time. I get citrus and malt on the back end with a doughy aftertaste.     This is probably once of the most balanced barleywines I've had so far. It's incredibly smooth and easy to drink for 9.6%. Hell, I'm on my second one and I just finished my dinner. I've always been a fan of Sierra Nevada, but this is my first go at their seasonal releases. I bought 1 four-pack. Now the only choice is to finish this glass and cellar the other two, or finish it off and cellar another 4 pack. Very good beer.    Revisited in depth on 1/22/2016. Same batch (12/18/2014). Numbers adjusted.

Taste is big, strong, and forward. Big malty-sweetness up front, then a huge hit of citrusy-hop bitterness. I get a real strong bitter grapefruit taste near the middle of the palate. Carbonation carries these flavors into the finish that consists of mouth-coating sweetness and hoppiness. Finishes with a present alcohol heat and bite.    The beer is good don't get me wrong, but this isn't something one person should drink. This would ideally be split between two people, not because of the ABV, but because of thickness. It has TONS of flavor, but drinking an entire bottle can be a bit tiring on the palate. I would pair this with a spicy beef chili. It gets a 87/100

L - Tan head that dissipates slowly. 2014 slower than 2015  S - 2014 has developed a greater depth and raisin smell. 2015's notes haven't completely formed but still brings a little richness.   T - 2015 brings a bitterness that hints of oats and raisins. 2014 brings a depth and smoothness of raisins.  F - 2015 is medium bitter, slightly carbonated. 2014 is smooth, finishes nicely.   O- Perfect for aging. 2015- isn't great but it has potential. I would give it a 3.75  2014 is much better with age and brings a great depth of flavor. I'd give it a 4.50

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 In my opinion this is the beer that should serve as part of the new standard for an American Barleywine style ale. The hop profile on this is simply divine whether you are drinking a fresh batch beer or one that has aged in the cellar for 2-3 years. If does have minor variation for each vintage year, my favorite so far being circa 2012, but it is consistently excellent. While these are no longer sold in 6-packs and they are a bit pricey, it is certainly worth the cost to buy a couple of 4-packs. Drink 2-3 now and cellar the rest to see how they develop with age.
