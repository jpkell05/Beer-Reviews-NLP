look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Poured from a single serve bottle into a tulip...    Pours crystal clear orange with visible carbonation, a limited head, but good lacing. Solid but not spectacular.    The aromas are classic DIPA, although mellow. Grapefruit flesh and zest, mango/guava, floral notes, grass, and white pepper. The hops present with somewhat of an oily aroma.    This DIPA has a strong malt presence at the forefront, but good hop balance. I was expecting more of an uneven hop bomb and was pleasantly surprised by the delivery. The crackery malt seamlessly gives way to grapefruit, pineapple, resin, white pepper, and grass. The ABV is well hidden.    The mouthfeel is medium with a good crisp finish thanks to excellent carbonation.     Overall a solid DIPA.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Poured from a 12oz bottle into a glass at 40-45 degrees,    Look: Pours a clear, vibrant orange color with a thick foamy, white head.  Smell: Aroma is overwhelming of hops.  Taste: The hop flavor is strong, but not too bitter.  Feel: The mouthfeel is thick and oily for an IPA.    Overall: This is a unique craft. As described it is overwhelming with hops. It must have been dry-hopped and then dry-hopped again, because while the bitterness remains low, the aroma and flavor is abounding with hops.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Light yellow, dense foam that keeps. Smells of lemon, pine, hints of grapefruit, maybe peach?

The beer pours mostly bright honey colored amber with sticky off white head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is candied orange, tangerine, pine and caramel. The taste is semisweet caramel with a liberal dose of piney bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied and adequately carbonated. The finish is mostly dry, but not sweet, just sticky from the hops. Overall, very good. Classic west coast DIPA. Wish the dates were easier to read and decipher, as this would be an easy repeat buy.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 LOOK: Crystal clear dark gold / copper / bronze color. Only a 1 finger head that dissipates quickly. Left with some lacing and a foam ring around the glass.  SMELL: Pungent Hops! All are in there: mango, pine, citrus, catty, etc. Some maltiness comes through.  TASTE: An absolute BLAST of hops - not on the bitterness side - although there is a slight bite at first. There is a sweetness of caramel and malt, but the hops quickly overtake the malt and the brew dries out slightly. There is a slight earthiness and woodiness to the tail end. All hop flavors come through strong: mango, pine, citrus, cattiness. Pretty complex with a lot of hop flavor. Very crisp and clean tasting.  FEEL: Medium bodied - could be better with a bit more carbonation - it seemed to flatten out fairly quickly.   OVERALL: A very tasty beer. This is so flavorful that any pale ale / IPA fan should enjoy. It's more like a Pale Ale that is turbo charged with late addition hops (so that there isn't much bitterness but tons of hop oils that infuse into the beer). I would grab more of these no problem.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 The name originally drew me into this beer; "Hop Stoopid" is just so ridiculous I had to try it. On the label, the company had written "Life is Uncertain. Don't Sip" and other personal messages. In addition, I'vebeen searching for a high alcohol percentage beer, this one is 8%, that I didn't find too heavy.    The color was golden with little head. The smell was fresh and light. There was little carbonation and had a lovely hoppy flavor. It does have a bitter aftertaste, but it lighter than other beers I have had with this alcohol content. Overall, I liked the presentation of this beer, both in the glass and not, and the flavor. Would reccomend as a beer one can happily enjoy all night.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A clear golden color with slight Amber hues. Chunky seafoam style topping stays afloat with thick, sticky lace all over. An awe inspiring appearance.    This one is fueled by hop extract. Not the actual plant material we all know and pray to. But, it sure does smell like whole cone, fresh hops!!   Sticky lupilin, herbal earthiness...if you've ever crushed up a fresh hop cone in your hands...you know what I mean. A light, herbal and grainy malt thing also is detected in the fine aromatics of this Stoopid ale.    The first sip is just...wow. Soo clean, but wildly complex. The golden ale style malt brings out this grainy and herbal malty flavor that I just love. Clean, but mean. Light bodied feel, crisp with maybe a dash of sweet bread. The malt plays the role of a very flavorful and excellent feeling base, or low end, like a bass guitar. The hops, or the hop extract is the lead guitar, rythm, singer and drummer! It's hard to separate the hop flavors, because it just tastes like a fresh-hop, whole cone style lupilin explosion. 102 ibu's?? There is almost no bitterness...just layers of fresh hop flavor. Earthy, subtle pine, very herbal and "hearty". 8% abv?? Doesn't seem possible. I'm thinking 6% tops. This stuff is Soo damn easy to drink, it's dangerous.     Hop Stoopid....damn. just really impressive how such a complex brew can be Soo easy. I love the earthy and grainy hop after taste and malty backbone. The balance of flavor blurs the lines of tradition and makes it's own, new tradition.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 1 Pint 6 fluid oz bottle poured into Duvel tulip. Picked it up at the grocery store for $4.99. No discernible date, however some numbers are printed on the neck of the glass.    Appearance - Pours large off-white head with great retention and thick, patchy lacing. Clear medium-to-deep gold body with light-to-moderate cloudiness from medium-sized floating particulate matter. 4.25    Smell - Smells malty sweet. Grassy, honey, even some dark fruit. The alcohol is not hidden at all. 4.75    Taste - Bitter up front. Bitter in the middle, and faintly bitter in the aftertaste. Some honey sweetness comes through underneath and really surfaces in the aftertaste. Pretty even grass bitterness almost all the way through. Very strange in how monotone it is on that front. But not in a bad way necessarily since it's unique in that regard. 4    Mouthfeel - Medium bodied. Astringent. Normally it would be off putting, but considering the rest of its profile, it works. 4    Overall - I guess the strange quality of this beer is the fact that they use hop extract rather than hops. It's interesting. None of these are flavors I haven't had before, but what makes it interesting is how strangely even they are throughout. 4

Tastes like snappy, juicy hops with a tart, balancing malt note. Not really "bitter" IMO    Medium mouthfeel with mild carbonation.

Not a massive amount of carbonation  Smell - Very typical of IPA's, getting strong hop aroma with notes of malt, mango, wheat, orange, grapefruit, raspberry  Taste - A lot sweeter than i expected. Very tasty though, the perfect mix of sweet and bitter hops. There is a strange flavor that lingers but i can't describe it. The alcohol is picked up at 8% but not really a big deal. Certainly not as bitter as i was expecting for the IBU's.     Fruit, Pine, grass, malt. Excellent flavor, feel, smell, and i love the low carbonation, so drinkable!  Gotta give them credit where it's due, this beer is a little expensive but worth it  I have to give this a grade of A+   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 One of my favorite, if not *the* favorite brewer I have...    ...and what another offering, special, indeed. The coloration is a rustic but light cooperish to the eyes. The beer pours out a white, puffy head and it has really nice lacing all the way down the glass. The smell has strong hints of resin, pine, and some cinnamon - just a light touch of booze, almost non-existent. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied but distinctly carbonated (not something that I gravitate towards), but the taste was an almost perfect blend to what met my nose - with the very distinct bitterness you would expect from something titled with the word "hop" to it. Overall, this is another special beer from what I consider an incredibly special brewer.

I drank it at room temperature so that the alcohol taste wouldn't be muted. It was perfect! Lagunitas does it again!

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5 Lagunitas made the only beer I rated all 4's but would have rated all ???. Maximus is the most hoppy beverage I'd had to that point. It was great, but only for hop heads looking for hops hops hops. There wasn't really any depth of flavor other than hops, and that was amazing to me. Years later I tried this and well, they have lightning in a bottle with this one. It's simply the best DIPA I've had, even better than Sixpoint's Resin which was tops, until this, but then this has a different profile, so two beers I'm going to revisit again and again.     L: Um... why is there debris in my beer? Suspended. That's not carbonation. There were a few bubbles. It had no head and no lace but the slow moving yeast. Really slow. Medium orange.   S: Frosting on a fruit salad. Mostly tangerine. Not sweet. I've never smelled tangerine so distinct.   M: Medium cream, very slight (!!!) bitter, more feel from the carbonation.   T: This defies every flavor from a Double IPA that I've ever had. It's not bitter yet it's 102 IBU. It doesn't burn. They got the mix of hops so precise that they have made a monster. I taste both tar and grapefruit plus Jujyfruits and tangerine. I have the impression that this has been pre-aged to mellow and wonder how it would be aged more than a year.   O: You would never know this is a DIPA because, well, it's actually a drinkable DIPA rather than a sip able DIPA. Be warned, don't start with this beer or you won't last long. I started with a run of the mill IPA and then had two of these and I was GONE. One of these would be a fantastic way to end the night. Named for what it does. Makes you Hop Stoopid. Best I've had.

Tropical fruit shows up most. Very well balanced. There are plenty of malty notes to even out the hops. Reall nice.    F---Juicy & plump. Makes me want another.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25 This one has the classic west coast style look and fruity characteristics.   Pours a very light amber with a 1 finger semi-bubbly head that seems to retain a slight covering throughout the time that you drink it.  Smell is extreme pine and resin that fades to something faintly tropical  Taste is mostly pine with a malty ending and lingering hoppy bitterness at the end  As it warms the IBU's begin to shine through but when cold it makes for an easy drinker  Heavy classic IPA mouthfeel (that I think we all lust for)  I have to grab this one really anytime I see it    Cheers

Taste of clean piney hops with a surprising kick of something like pineapple or tropical like fruit that's very well comingled with the underlying malt. Not an array of flavors but enough to tell me this is a complex brew. I neither scent nor taste the alcohol and didn't realize it was 8% until I read the description after the review.    Medium full texture with balancing carbonation.    Whew, of course I was expecting hop flavors but these come across as rather sophisticated in the way they blend together weaving in and out like the strands of a rope with each contributing without competing. A very competent beer that's easy to drink.

Hoppy for sure but with an slice of pineapple. Surprising. Slight hint of alcohol but there are plenty of IPAs with more than 8%. Call it welcoming. I call it fine. Served colder the better.

The nose is tropical. I'm getting sweet pineapple and orange with some earthiness in the middle and a nice hops bite to balance out the sweetness. Aromatic to say the lease  The taste is most bitter that the nose would lead you to believe. You get the same fruit with toned down sweetness and a bitter kick to the palate. Tasty.  Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. Carbonation is lifting but not to much. Feels right.  This one gets a solid 4. Its pretty damn tasty with a great price point to boot.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 From a 22oz bottle. Amber with a half finger of head. Smells of pine resin. A sticky feel. Caramel malt backbone with some pine resin, citrus, and bitterness. Yes, it's a hop bomb, but there's plenty of depth too.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Golden copper hued body; thick, sticky, rocky head. Piney, spicy aroma. Fine tasteful blend of grainy malt and zesty hop punch and bitterness; plenty of cracker and bread crust. Heavy body; rich and crunchy; some boozy heat and sugary heft.    Ah yeah, a fine - heck, very fine, IPA. It's been around and still delivers a hop bitter, densely flavored punch to the palate.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Bottle:  Lovely clear medium gold, medium-large fluffy white head, nice sheets of lacing early.    Nose is medium brown cracker with a grassy to citrus rind bitterness. A mix of orange/tangerine peel and zest, grapefruit pith, dry grass and pine needles.    More of the bittering agents in the taste, as expected from the 100+ IBUs. The malt comes through from the nose, but only for a fleeting moment. The more piney hop notes rush in with a vengeance. Grapefruit and tangerine ride along the wave of piney-ness. A bit of earthy dank sneaks in the back of this quite crisp, but somewhat biting beer.    A classic that isn't a singular bitter bomb. Bitter, yes, but there is a bit of a classic citrusy/piney flavor profile that gets wrapped by the bitterness.

Can't say there is anything super memorable about, but good nonet.    Bottled from TJs in Royal Oak MI.

A thin ring on the outer edges remains indefinitely, leaving some splotchy lacing down the sides.    S: Big bitter grapefruit peel and orange peel, light brown sugar, catnip, weed, the signature burnt rubber, and soft pine.    T: Big bittersweet grapefruit and orange upfront--white grapefruit flesh and orange peel. Hints of guava, papaya, and mango. Light brown sugar malt, but crisp and not overly sweet. Some dankness, and earthy, woody, bark-like pine. Finishes remarkably crisp and clean, lightly dry, alcohol completely hidden. An aftertaste of bitter orange and grapefruit peel lingers for a few minutes.    F: Medium, well-carbonated, crisp, clean, and lightly dry. Very drinkable.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Beer is a nice orange color with a slightly off white head. Head is very strong and keeps about a finger of height. Some haze.    Aroma is pine, resin, and dank.     Flavor is bitter, but with nice bread malt notes. Piney and resin after finish really coats your mouth.    Really hop bomb, but not overly bitter. Well made, very piney and resiney.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Poured a clear medium amber with a one finger creamy head. Moderate lacing was present. Aroma was piney with a little grapefruit. The taste washes over your tongue, first with a bit of honey malt then quickly the piney hops overwhelms but just as quickly settles down to a nicely balanced ale. I was expected this to be too hoppy for my tastes, which tend to the maltier side of beer. The body was medium with medium carbonation.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Clear amber in color, nice half-finger lingering head with nice lacing. Medium to strong hoppy scents with hints of pine, tropical fruit and green bell pepper. Smooth taste. Very well balanced. Was expecting very hoppy on the palate from the smell, but this one surprised me. Front palate of grapefruit, honey, pineapple and pine. Finish pine heavy with a hint of old road. Finish is long, with a coating effect that lasts up to a minute. Good beer.

It may be the best Aroma I have ever smelled coming out of a beer even though it was poured into a red Solo cup in the club. It is a little dry on the tongue which I think is not something out of the ordinary given the amount of hops that is in it which creates a great taste. I highly, highly recommend this beer.

Imperial Hop Head Bliss.     Shame it took me so long to experience this one, interesting contrast with the more crisp, bubblie Pine ride of Lagunitas Maximus.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a golden/copper into a fifteen ounce glass mug the same temperature as the beer. Three fingers of foamy white head that lasts. Finally settles to a thick rime. Big sticky lacing. Very good looking brew.    The nose is ripe white grapefruit. Some resinous pine and distinct caramel malts. A touch of grassiness. Cross between and IPA and an American Pale Ale.    Mild hops up front. Some clean spiciness. Excellent malt backbone makes for a balanced and drinkable brew. Some more pine breaks through.    Soft mouthfeel. Well balanced and finishes a little sweet. Very pleasant.    Overall a very good IPA but also carries the distinct qualities of an American Pale Ale. A super blend consisting of both styles.

Aroma is bright lemon grass, pine , grapefruit some orange notes after it sits a while. Nice bright hoppy brew.    Taste is like the nose bright hoppy citrus, lemon, grapefruit and pine dominating some gassy earthy hints underneath riding and over powering a bready malt base.    Mouthfeel is lighter side with pretty peppy carbonation which probably makes it seem even lighter.    Overall a nice light hop loaded IPA for the summer, wouldn't guess that its 8%.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Pours a definate orange color with very little head but plenty of carbonation. Smells quite orangey pine and hoppy. Initial taste is quite bitter up front then mellows out but bitter at the end as well. I am actually not an IPA man but consider this brew quite drinkable for the style. Glad I tried

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass on 6/7/2017.    Has a beautiful orange color with a nice, white, creamy head that left good lacing.    Aroma of orange and grapefruit with some hops and a touch of malts.    Tastes really good. No flavor profile stands out too much, which may disappoint some IPA nuts who love bitter beers. However, I love the mix of flavors that are in perfect balance.    Great mouthfeel, fair amount of carbonation and is a medium-bodied. No real alcohol burn even at 8%.     All in all, while this may not be the best, per se, DIPA out there in terms of flavor, this is a super flavorful and drinkable DIPA that is good for almost any occasion.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 The appearance was a golden orange slightly transparent body with a one finger white foamy head. Carbonation is seen rising. The smell had some sweet and spicy through citrus, hops, and malts. The taste was mainly sweet, slight bittering flavors come through citrus, slight pine/resinous thing goin’ on. On the palate, it sat about a medium, smooth, fairly sessionable, bittersweet aftertaste and finish. Overall, this is a good one for the style, glad I tried it, and almost always come back to whenever I can.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 A very pretty beer, a brilliant burnt orange color with cream colored fluffy head. Aroma is lots of piney hops & oranges. In spite of the strong hop influence it's more sweet than bitter. Plenty of pine, kind of makes you want to go Christmas tree shopping even though it's summer. Orange & citrus flavors follow, then a hint of grains & yeast. And lastly the tongue get long lasting carbonated massage. I'n not very big on hoppiness by this is really good.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 650ml bottle poured into a pint glass.    Mildly hazed orange amber hue, the pour builds up very thick creamy off-white head that lastingly stands with excellent retention before slowly collapsing to an everlasting foamy layer atop and leaving numerous amount of sticky and refined lacing here and there, so gorgeous showcase.    In a nose, there comes the hoppy goodness of tropical, citrus, grapefruit, mango, peach, pepper, and pine. Malt is also there with its bread, candy, and caramel.    The taste is straightforward for what Imperial IPA is all about. It begins with fruity hop of tropical, grapefruit, citrus, mango, peach, also pine and pepper. Malt plays in the supporting role but is not sunken with its rich sweetness, bread, candy, and caramel. The end and aftertaste is wrapped up and well lasting with solid and persistent hop bitterness.    Medium to rather full body with silky smooth mouthfeel from its soft effervescence and lively crisp carbonation, the feeling is very refreshing with a pleasantly dry finish.    Well-rounded IPA with very good hop profile that presents in intense but balance fashion, there is nothing too sharp but is well harmonized in very good order. Alcohol is also perfectly concealed underneath its deliciousness.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Pours a solid gold color. Lovely beer to admire for its eye. A wonderful scent of fruit and grain hits the nose. I taste strong hops and subtle citrus. It's a remarkable blend of both. Great mouthfeel that is bold yet goes down as smooth as a double possibly could. Perfect drinkability.    = Lagunitas hits another homerun with this brew. It's bitter and ever so refreshing. A lighter DIPA at 8% but has all the character it should. Remarkable brew.

Always enjoyed this one, drinks so smooth for a DIPA. Clear, amber color, with a foamy head. Streak lacing. The aroma is grain, stone and tropical fruit, and some orange. The flavor is citrus, caramel malt, ripe fruit, grass, spice, and herbal notes. It is hop forward, juicy and resinous. Slightly acrid, dry finish. A hint of alcohol vapor. A decent beer, definitely worth trying.

Really nice balance ....it's not "stoopidly'' hoppy as the label suggests. One side note....on all of this brewery's bottles/packs you can not find the brewery bottled or expiration date like most crafters have...or it's in code on the bottom of cans.... Just wondering. I have bought other beers showing fresh dates instead of Lagunitas for this reason.

I had it once before and wasn't blown away, but I must have chanced upon a really good batch this time because everything is coming together for me now: tangy hops hit tempered by the sweet malty backbone, all in service of disguising the healthy alcohol sting. Even better balanced for me than Maximus, which is saying a lot. In conclusion: love me some West coast-style DIPAs! Cheers and stuff.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 4.75 If this is close to the Pliny, its great. Wish I could get more NEIPA. Southern Tier unfiltered was awesome. Ballast Point too clean.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A good go-to DIPA when I want something hoppy, juicy, and a little heavier in the summer.     L: Clear golden-orange, white head, lots of lacing.    S: Pine resin, tangerine, golden malt    T: Piney, grapefruit, sweet citrus, pale malt, a touch of booze. Melon, mango, more pine. Finishes bitter and clean, and little dry.    F: Sticky enough to feel like a lot of DIPAs, but thin and dry enough to be an easy-drinker.     Overall, it's nothing you haven't had if you've had a lot of West Coast IPAs/DIPAs. Piney, citrusy, a little tropical, flavorful, and a little boozy. Clean and consistent though, and worth a buy if you dig the style.

Aroma is inviting but a tad light - notes of bubblegum, citra / tropical (mango, pineapple) and resin. Pretty smooth double, though it does lack a defining flavor. A little NW hop resin, some more tropical flavors, some bitter grapefruit pine at the end but nothing too much. Good golden / crystal malt flavor underneath. I am by no means an advocate of hop bombs or beers overhopped to the point of being abrasive or lacking depth, but this needed a bit more oomph.

Balanced and clean with little detectable ethanol, delightful citrusy and piney hops with high bitterness that fades instantly upon swallowing, leaving a faint pleasant citrus linger that makes you want another gulp.

Smell: Grapefruit Rind, Candied Bitter Orange, Evergreen very subtle, Slightly Lemony  Taste: Bitter at first, Grapefruit, Grapefruit Rind, Bitter Orange, faint lemon, then it changes, you still get all the citrus flavors but they have sweeter hint to them, then it fades, and most of what is left is Lemony clean citrus with a cereal malty- like flavor. It's a quintessential west coast IPA, which still in my book is the best style of IPA, Double IPA.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 L -- Nice golden hued brew with a two finger solid white head produced with moderate pour. Good retention and some lacing. Would be a 4.5, but there's some rather unsightly floaties that can be seen settled to the bottom of the bottles before being poured. Based on the other reviews, I'm not the only person to experience this, so I doubt it's due to issues on the retailer side.  S -- Lots of fruity and floral hops: pineapple, peach, mango, apricot, honey, and a hint of vanilla.   T -- Not as one-sided as initially thought. The hoppiness largely follows the nose, but the flavors are backed up by a sweet malty backbone that cuts through some of the IBUs, much in the way Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA does.   F -- Big and lasting. Not for the faint of heart.   O -- A great ale for people who like the tropical fruitiness that hops can impart. Had alongside Lawson's Sip of Sunshine and noticed many similarities between the two, especially in terms of aromas.    83/100

Really fruity and sweet. Get hints of candied citrus fruit. Light hints of tropical fruits, mostly pineapple. Also notes of pine and pine resin. Malts are sweet and honey like  T: Great clean flavor. Surprisingly not that bitter, actually not all that different from a standard pale ale in that regard. Sweet fruit flavors dominate. Not much from the malt, somewhat cracker like and dry. No EtOH taste  F: Light body. very crisp. Carb on the med-high range. Bitterness only mildly astringent.   O: Nice beer, might be good for the summer since its refreshing and fruit flavors are great during the summer. Would definitely recommend this.

Smell: Feint smells of grain, melon, and some form of citrus, maybe grapefruit.     Taste: Malts, earthy dank flavors, grapefruit, and other citrus fruits.     Feel: I'm noticing a sweetness throughout the presence of the beer, with a bitter dry finish occurring. The body of Hop Stoppid feels about medium, not overly syrupy, like I thought Waldo was. The feel, overall, is pretty decent.     Overall: This is a nice example of a west school double IPA, and is pretty tasty.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 L - Amber color to the beer. Had a thin, white head that dissipated after a few seconds. Leaves nice, white lacing.    S - Aroma of citrus and grass. It is not the most intense smelling beer, but I believe that is a positive aspect of it.    T - The front end of the beer follows the smell: Citrus is definitely in the spotlight, but the hops are there as well. As it moves from the front end to the back end, the hops definitely become more prevalent. Bitterness is present on the back end. Does not taste like 8% ABV, the alcohol fits with the flavor, which I enjoy.    F - I would say that the feeling is more on the watery side than the thick side. It does not feel like you have to chew through your beer. Toward the back end, it definitely does dry out the mouth a bit, which is great motivation to have another sip.    O - This was a quite enjoyable American Double IPA. The taste and feel did not overwhelm me with booziness, which is usually my complaint about the style. I feel like having multiple bottles of this beer in a row would not be a chore, but a treat. While I would not buy it every week to drink, it will definitely be one to come back to again in the future. Great beer.

I never even looked to see who made the beer. I finally looked more and decided to give it a try. Scent is of sweet fruits and mild grapefruit citrus, very normal double IPA nose and really smells inviting. Really nice flavor of sweet grapefruit with additional fruitiness and hop bitterness. Wow this is pretty good. Says 102 ibu but it's well masked in the citrus finish and it hides the alcohol quite well. Medium body and fairly well carbonated. Cheers !

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A nice example of what has become the prototypical West Coast (D)IPA, with pungent hops on the nose, predominantly earthy/herbal with lighter touches of citrus, all set against a clean malt base. There's some sweetness on this one, though it seems to come more from the alcohol (of which there is a light, but noticeable boozy bite) than the grain. Copper colored, thankfully not too much specialty malt, decent rim of foam that hangs on a bit. Not heavy feeling, but there is, instead, a rather pleasant smoothness to the body. Indeed, it made me think of something all the NEIPA lovers would like - a certain richness to it, albeit one that finishes out/cleans up well. Overall, a very pleasant brew and one any DIPA connoisseur will enjoy.

I used to think this was best beer in the world. well now like 8 years later I realize that's not true. im all about hazy new england ipas and this beer falls a little short. but still a very good beer at an awesome price. not the beer I used to remember. but after heady topper things usually change. glad they came out w sixers of this.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 Pours a bright amber. Aroma is sweet and floral, with citrus, pine, and yes, dankness. Big bold flavor that dances across the tip of the tongue before settling back for a long aftertaster Beady malts, earth, orange rind, grass, aggressive bitterness, some alcohol. This nothing less than a killer West Coast-style IPA, and it's great that it comes in 6 packs.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 12oz. bottle poured into fluted snifter.    Amber, a slight haze but mostly clear. Thick foamy big bubbled head pops itself out into floating islands and thin collar around the glass edge.    I smell resinous and earthy hops, hint of pine and weedy plants. Hint of sweetness and bread dough malts in the aroma as well.    Citrus zest, bitter orange rind, and herbal and resinous earthy hop flavor followed by a hint of pine. Malts come through as doughy with a caramel sweetness that balances everything together. A very smooth and easy drinking DIPA.    Moderate carbonation and hint more body than medium.    Nice and balanced brew that doesn't let the IBUS or late addition hops take over the malts.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Hop Stoopid brewed by Lagunitas Brewing Company, with an ABV of 8.00% This brew pours out a deep golden amber color with a nice thick white head. There is a decent amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hops bitterness, and earthly grains and malts. There is also a slight sweetness, to the smell of this brew. Now for the taste, it is bold with hops flavors , then it smooths out. There is also a nice amount of grains and malts. I really like the taste, of this brew. I can't get over how smooth this brew is, it is really hard to pick up on the 8.00% ABV in this brew. There is nothing overpowering about this brew at all, it has a super nice balance to it. The mouth feel of Hop Stoopid is Hops, Bold, Rich, and Smooth. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.50 out of 5. I would definitely buy this brew again. Lagunitas Brewing Company, did a super nice job with this brew.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 From a 12 oz. bottle. Dark straw to light amber appearance with a nice white two finger head. Smells of oily and dank pine with minor citrus notes. Sticky dank hops and semi-sweet bready malt are the two main flavor components. Finish is clean and persistent. Feel is what you'd expect from a West Coast DIPA - medium to medium heavy body and moderate carbonation. I passed over buying bombers of this because freshness always seemed to be an issue. Now that this is available in 6-packs it will be a staple in my fridge - this is a tasty DIPA that is priced right. Well done Lagunitas.

Has a nice sticky head that reached the top of the glass and is leaving a nice lacing.    S: Very nice smell. Classic west coast style. Lots of bright hops in the nose. Fruity, juicy, and piney all at the same time.    T: Taste is close to on-par with the aroma. It's a little sweeter. Caramel sweetness, maybe a little honey, fruity, hoppy, and piney.    F: Very sticky. It's got a resinous quality to it, which is pretty common in west coast IPA's. Fresh and hoppy at the front, good body in the middle, and slightly boozy on the way down.    O: Very enjoyable beer. This stands up there to some of Lagunitas other IPA's pretty well. I think I enjoy Born Yesterday a good bit more because of the wet hopping, but this beer is solid as well.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Burnt gold with a uniform soft foam top.    Smell is super dank and pungent with a touch of apple cider vinegar I sometimes get in the Trillium yeast/hop cocktail, with sticky, damp pine cone and orange.    Taste is tangy orange, cannabis, grapefruit, faint bread, and that hint of apple cider vinegar.    Really soft and fluffy but clean and dry. A tasty treat for sure.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Bought a six pack at The Keg in Clarksville IN, a great store. Poured into a pilsner glass.    Poured with a smallish head. Little lacing. Maybe I poured it too gently lol. But so pretty to look at, like apple juice.    Smells of pine, citrus, light earth, some floral. It's not POW in your face like a hop forward double, nice and balanced aroma.    Tastes like it smells. Light dank pine resin, citrus is there, light bread so there is some malt balance. Pine increases some with temperature. This is almost weird, but I don't know where the 102 IBU is. Now, that can be good or bad...Did you expect an in your face bitter hop bomb? Then it might be disappointing. Did you expect some wonderfully balanced IPA that was smooth in taste and encourged a session drink because it didn't overpower you? Then this is your ticket...and it is a scary ticket, because it REALLY hides the 8% ABV. You better take note of that first because as I said it encourages session drinking!     Feel is just perfect for me. Crisp, light carbonation, a light oil to the tongue. It's refreshing, too refreshing for 8% ABV. See how I keep coming back to that?    Overall: It is a clean, balanced IPA that hides the booze. So drinkable. Which I like. So many higher ABV IPA's overpower and fill you up, this one does not. Great beer for killing a sixer at home.

No alcohol taste.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Poured from 22-ounce bottle into a stemless wine glass. Bottled three months before date sampled. Nice burst of pine resin and citrus zest upon opening. Very impressive in appearance, crystal-clear apple juice color with a fluffy white head and tons of lacing. Aromas and flavors of pine resin, citrus zest, and light bready malt. The hop character is somewhat subdued, with the malt sweetness providing some nice balance. The bitterness is there, but doesn't seem to be anywhere near the 102 IBU's claimed. Finish is clean, with a light bittersweet finish. Not the hop bomb I was expecting, but nicely balanced and very drinkable.

Flavor starts off with bittersweet grapefruit, sweet, juicy orange, hint of peach and then pine, resin, dankness. Lots going on. Bit of caramel and sweet bready malts.    Medium bodied, crisp, clean, slightly creamy mouthfeel and NO hint of the alcohol. Too easy to drink.    A classic West Coast DIPA at only $9.99 for a 6-pack!!! Deal of the century!!

Taste when cold is a dank pine explosion with some residual booziness. As it warms, more balance is evident. Malty caramel notes balance the hops and booze. Much better warmer than ice cold. Mouthfeel is a little oily due to all of the hop resin but still nice. Overall, an excellent beer. Highly recommended.

Smell: Not all that strong but a noticeable piney hop aroma.  Taste: The 102ABU on the bottle promises a hop forward taste which it has but it's not overpowering & a good malt balance keeps it from being too dry or bitter on the finish. Definitely some pine & floral, but also some fruit: tangerine, maybe mango/plum, lighter citrus/grapefruit.  Feel: Moderately full & milky smooth  Overall: A nice DIPA which rivals some of the best I've had. Definitely a great beer.

Smell: Hop resin, light grapefruit, possibly some other cilight citrus smells in their (orange?)  Taste: Monster hop resin throughout, starts with a nice mild sweetness, ends with a piney/resiny bitterness, that is also sweet. Very light mango like tropical hop flavor. Some orange and grapefruit rind as it warms. As it warms more the flavor pops with grapefruit and orange citrus flavor.  Feel: Resiny coating at the end of each sip. Moderate carbonation, full mouthfeel.  OverallI had never had this beer fresh before. This one was 11 days old. Wow what a difference. This is an incredible beer. Absolutely delicious. Love it.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This was poured nice and fresh from tap into a pint jar. A clear golden yellow with beautiful head that stuck around and great curtain lacing. The smell is subdued but piney. The first taste was great! Huge grapefruit at first that settled down to a wonderful combination of citrus and piney hops. It had been a while since I had this beer, but I will not wait this long again. A classic!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Based on the date, this bomber is a month old--but Lagunitas doesn't make it easy to figure out, what with the modified Julian dating and black ink on a brown bottle. But it's way better than no date, for sure.     Pours a very clear copper-orange with a finger of dense foam. Bit of lacing. Smells of pine, grapefruit and some tropical fruits. After warming, the malt comes through along with a musty, earthy smell.     Taste is grapefruit pith and pine, with just enough sweet malt to add a counterpoint. Good stuff. Solid bitterness completes the picture.     Feel is medium-minus. Overall an enjoyable West Coast IIPA. I find Lagunitas' regular IPA to be extremely bland--this is much more up my alley.

The first thing I noticed was the foggy/honey color. The carbonation is great- almost as much carbonation as a Coke. I usually don't like that, but it makes the beer refreshing. The first taste is piney resin, then a satisfying bitter that isn't strong; mild bitter aftertaste for about 5 secs. All the tastes go together perfectly. It won't blow your mind, but it will be a great beer.

This beer has that typical Laugnitas taste we all know w/ some nice citrus notes and a nice hopping finish that really makes you keep drinking more. There is a long bitter after taste that really doesn't cringe in your mouth, it's just there. This is definitely not my favorite offering from Lagunitas, but this hangs up with some of the great DIPAs.

But, I'm cleaning up my ratings by trying every one again and writing a review that includes something about the brewer.  In Lagunitas' case, I've had 21 (a goodly amount by my standards) and admire them for opening a plant in the Chicago ghetto and providing all sorts of good things like jobs and beer happiness (or happiness as is more the case.)    Probably four years into a don't-look-back relationship with Heineken, Lagunitas is still having fun and producing good craft.     Life is good.  And no need for me to comment on the beer. Except that I like it .... despite being a narrow-minded malt-head.    I should comment on the AIIPA category. I've had 40 and not one of the 15 on the first page do I rate above the average. The same goes for those on the 2nd or 3rd page of AIIPAs. In other words, I'm biased.   But, I still want you to enjoy Lagunitas ales.  Now is that respect for beer ?

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Description: Bright, crystal clear apple juice color with clean white head and lacing. Smell is fresh and clean with notes of pine but an underlying fruit/sweetness. The taste has a crisp, dry, somewhat bitter finish but still has some fruit and sweetness throughout. The flavor isn't overwhelmingly strong, but in this case I don't think that really detracts from it; it's sort of a delicate, nuanced flavor. Mouthfeel is light, without much carbonation. Smooth for an IPA.    Suggested food pairing: Grilled salmon    If you like this beer then you should also try: Truth    Overall: 4.25 (This beer is good and I would likely drink it again) Given the name and the fact that is has a whole mess of IBUs, I expected this to be a hopbomb; I wasn't pleasantly surprised to find that it was not. Flavors were much more nuanced and complex than that. As always, Lagunitas turns out another great beer that I think would have wide appeal across the beer drinking world.

S: Pine and citrus, light tropical fruit, a little caramel sweetness, and a touch of biscuity malt.     T: Resinous pine, citrus, grapefruit zest, a little orange, floral notes, subtle tropical fruit, passion fruit and mango, biscuity malt, and a touch of caramel sweetness.     M: Medium body, moderate carbonation. Very drinkable for 8%    O: Maybe not my favorite Lagunitas brew, but still darn tasty. And a steal at $5/bomber.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a crystal clear medium Amber with a two inch, well retained off white head which leaves excellent lacing. Smell is piney and grassy with orange notes. Taste follows the nose with some orange rind, tropical fruits and some malt sweetness. Bitter and dry, but not nearly as bitter as the IBU's would indicate. Mouthfeel is dry with light carbonation. Overall very good.

Comes out very light colored. Yellow. Nice 1/2" white head. Aroma can drop the hop oils quite pungent, but lately isn't all that.     Taste drops lots of Simcoe hops. Mouthfeel has a light toasted pale and oat body to it that really stands out when done well. Bomber only format sucks, don't know why they can't do this in 6 packs. Not as bitter or boozy as the label would lead you to think. Lots of tree like hop notes to it. When its in top form, its one of the best ipas out there, but on average, it has fallen into second (still very good) tier status.     Please bottle date & 6 pack this beer.

Wine & Beer (£7.50):  Great stuff, this one is a hop bomb to start with thanks to the huge hit of resinous pine to open things up but there was also plenty of sweetness & malts coming through from the middle onwards to help balance things out. I particularly enjoyed the tropical fruits, especially the mango that featured quite early on but the entire beer was a good one.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 March 20, 2016    22 oz. bomber, tulip    A – Medium amber, with very high clarity, quite well-filtered. Half-inch foam cap, uniform and long-lasting, is white to slightly off-white.     S – Resin and pine lead the nose, with some tropical notes of mango and papaya, and a dank muskiness enveloping it all. Toasty malt notes with just a hint of caramel or brown sugar. Light note of red apple and pineapple on the finish.    T – Incredibly balanced considering the amount of hopping involved, assuming accuracy of the IBU claim. Resinous hops are most prominent, followed closely by tropical mango and papaya, with a bit of pineapple. Pine and spicy herbal notes come in at the end. Low caramel and toast malt flavors provide a base for the big hop flavors, and add sweetness to balance moderate-high hop bitterness.     M – Plenty of malt sweetness is countered by a lot of hop bitterness, well-balanced though the bitterness wins out and lingers on the finish. Medium-high body with a slightly syrupy, resiny quality, juicy with little dryness. Carbonation is moderate, normal.     O – A prime example of West Coast IPA, very well-executed.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a mason jar. Tall white head that lasted through half the first (aggressive) pour. Good lacing too. The color is a beautiful golden brown. Smell is strong citrus, hops, and some pine. Taste follows the smell. Great citrus and pine, with strong, but balanced hops. Very balanced for 102 IBUs. Much easier to drink than I anticipated for the high IBU, possibly due to the lower ABV (8%), which is essentially unnoticeable. Overall, this is a great DIPA I will drink again.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 As soon as the beer begins the pour my nose is slammed with a blast of citrus, juice and rinds, mostly oranges, with a bit of pine in the background. Frothy head caps a beautiful translucent amber body. First sip and I taste some bread-like notes at the beginning, beneath the palate, that quickly expand into the hop-bomb promised by the nose. The citrus and pine flavors literally burst and take over, but not unpleasantly. There's a slight alcohol burn at the end, but the juicy hop profile holds strong throughout.

A massive head formed right off of the pour. Slow to collapse, the head left excellent rings of sticky lacing behind.     Nose  Tropical hops were prominent. Sharp notes of grapefruit. Sweet layers of orange, mango, and a splash of pineapple. Tart and sweet aroma all around.     Tongue  Good hit of grapefruit up front. Sweet notes of orange and pineapple juices sweetened the palate. The most abrasive notes came from herbal hops, most notably pine. Finished dry with lingering notes of pine and grapefruit.     Mouth  Medium bodied. Moderate carbonation.     Notes  Damn good DIPA. No shortage of juicy hops. The advertised 102 IBUs did not feel as overwhelming as I thought they would, but this was all-in-all a great brew. It is an extremely accessible, affordable, and high quality DIPA, you really have no reason to pass this one up!

The aroma when you open a bomber is impressive. But the flavors are some what muddled. This is not to say I didn't enjoy it. But the flavors are somewhat muddled. It is hard to pick out anything other than general pine and general citrus. I would buy this again. Especially at the $3. that my local liquor store is charging for a 22 oz. but it pales in comparison to Pliny or the calling.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Deep golden, billowy head. Heavy lacing. The classic look of an IPA.     Peach, guava, tropical hops, grapefruit, pine, bread / malt.    Grapefruit, bitter hops, pine, resin, sweet malt. Lots of hop flavor. Bitterness is moderate, a little astringent, a bit sweet but not as cloying as some other Lagunitas brews.    Moderate thickness, moderate carbonation.     It is what it implies. In my opinion, a crisper, cleaner, drier platform might lend more impact to the hops. But the sheer volume of hop flavor packed into this beer is astounding. Bitterness is on the lower side of what you might expect, paving way for flavor, flavor, flavor.   Very good, and at 10$ a sixer I would like to have a couple of these in the fridge when possible.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Serving Type: Bottle (Dated 1.26.16)  Consumed: 3.4.16    A: 4.5 Pours a clear, reddish-brown with a large, off-white head. Good retention and lots of lace in the glass.    S: 4.25 Pretty strong hops as soon as the cap is off. Lots of pine, dank, and some mild citrus and tropical fruit, mostly grapefruit and pineapple. Mild sweet malt presence in the background, but mostly overpowered by hops.     T: 4.25 Like the nose, flavors are start with minimal malt sweetness followed by a big dose of oniony, dank, piney hops. A bit of grapefruit peel shows up from the nose, but fruit flavors are covered up a bit by the strong onion flavor. The finish is nice with pleasant bitterness.    M: 4.5 Great body and carbonation; substantial without feeling too heavy.    O: 4.25 This is a great double IPA from Lagunitas. Lots of good flavors and super drinkable. The only real problem with this beer is Sucks – it’s a bit more fruit forward, cheaper, and easier to find fresh as hop stoopid is usually pretty old. Still, it’s nice to try this one out from time to time.

It was more orange in the aroma. And LOTS of bready, biscuit, caramel malty goodness to balance it out. Bitterness hits mid palate and builds over the course of the beer.  FEEL: DRY! All the way through, but there is a sticky quality to this beer as well, like a Hopslam. Nice medium full level of carbonation. Medium full body.  OVERALL: Just about the perfect IPA for me. Why? Because the hops shine through great AND it has some killer malt action going on. Reminds me slightly of Celebration, and Hopslam, each in their own way.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a bottle, Julian-dated June 6th, 2015 (8 months ago). Clear gold color with a creamy frothy head. Smell is dank; citrus, pine, lemon perhaps - very dank hops as it warms especially. Balance is achieved with just a little bit of malty sweetness to offset the massive hop pallet. Taste is clean, hop squeezed goodness, sour/dank and amazingly refreshing. I love the little hop bite on the edge of the tongue this beer leaves. The dazzling taste combines with a very otherworldly, growing feeling in the back of the head as you feel the hidden alcohol come to the surface. Refreshing, yet such a tempting beer to just keep drinking. A pint and 6 oz could even have you a little incapicitated for a while. I can't get enough of the cool refreshing taste, this beer sets quite a standard at $5 a bottle. I love when these higher abv IPA's take on such a dank, sour, clean tone and this one is a perfect example of one of my favorites I've tried. Outstanding.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bomber bottle into a tulip glass.     L - Light copper color with lots of orange; perfectly clear with tons of miniscule bubbles constantly rising to the surface. Moderate white head fades to a thick skin and great lacing.    S - Strong grapefruit and pine aromas dominate, but not as assertive as I expected. Behind that is some light bready malt. Like the aromas, the flavors are more muted than I wanted in a DIPA.     T - Initial flavor hits are grapefruit and orange citrus, followed by bready, slightly sweet malt in the mid-palate. Then the hops return with intense bitterness over an off-dry finish.    F - Medium body. Creamy, fluffy carbonation. Moderate alcohol burn blends with the intense hops bitterness.     O - This is a clean, but blisteringly hopped DIPA that is a little disappointing for the lack of aromatics.

Beautiful, clean, crisp appearance. Nice level of carbonation, small, slow rising bubbles, not explosive.    Nose: Wonderful, robust, hoppy, grapefruit, orange peel, citrus, piney aromas. Refreshing.    Palate: At the front, bitter hoopy, grapefruit, orange peel, piney, character. Perhaps even a little vanilla and caramel. Mild sweetness in the middle and on the finish, with bitterness still present, yet not overpowering. Very clean and refreshing.     Feel: Very light and lively on the tungue. Very refreshing. Although bitter, it is not sharp feeling, yet wakes up your tastebuds.    Overall: This is the third bottle of Hop Stoopid that I've consumed within a thirty to forty-five day span, the second bottle I consumed last night. This is a VERY nice Imperial IPA. Alcohol is very well cloaked. In all fairness, I'm not certain if I'm rating it too high or too low. I only know that i REALLY like it!

Don't make the same mistake I did by passing over it for harder to get hyped up DIPAs if you haven't had this one yet

T: Less citrus than expected given the smell, but still there and still sweet. Big hops with a bitterness that lingers, but not too much.  F: smooth mouthfeel with medium carbonation.    O: A very good DIPA hopbomb. Well balanced and drinkable. For under $5 for a bomber it is a great value. Solid beer.

Hitting the blah blah, something burns just for a something or other, trickery for a carb burn but it stings like booze. Here the malt is packed backstage in favor of the hop blast. It's quite coating, blah something something blah fruit and mahogany notes, but bah blah something thins it out upon completion.     Overall, this "hop bomb" is, in my humble opinion, a bit more balanced than originally thought. We just got these in Hawaii and I neglected to check the date, but that'll be remedied soon.

Taste- sweet and juicy on the tongue. However, before the sweetness becomes almost cloying, the hops hits you. As with the aroma, they are citrusy, piny and resinsy. The finish has a touch of sweetness and then an herbal and bitter aftertaste.  Feel- softly carbonated and medium bodied. Juicy feel. Creamy and smooth.  Overall- this is a good one. A strong mix between sweet and bitter.

Contrary to the name, this beer is not merely concentrated hop juice - the strong citrus taste is very well balanced against the strong malt backbone. A deep orange with an excellent head an an alluringly strong hop-heavy aroma, this beer effortlessly satisfies. At $.4.49 for a bomber, this is the no-brainer choice when you want to enjoy a good IPA.

A caramel malt backbone buried under a mountain of pithy, resinous bitterness. Some peach and mango leading to a bitter, lingering finish.    The Rest: This right here is a textbook hop bomb, yet is still pretty drinkable.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 I have had a few of these over the years... If you crave a bitter red grapefruit taste in your IPA this is the one for you !    22 oz bomber. no bottling info     Pours a clear orange-yellow body with a white head. some retention, good lacing all the way down the glass    Smell is mainly a grapefruit citrus. a little peach, with a tiny bit of discernible malt    Taste is ruby red grapefruit VERY tart with a nice bitterness that I really enjoy. There is no balance of malt (Yet I am giving it a 4.75?!?!) Once and a while I crave a red grapefruit tart flavor. This beer delivers this and then some .    Medium feel    Overall; This beer has a very particular grapefruit type bitter taste. There is a tartness here that is really enjoyable to those of us that like that. No there is no malt backbone. But the tartness is outstanding...

Not much head maybe a finger head with decent lace retention. It has a strong citrus smell but malts seem to takeover on the tongue. I felt the drinkability of this beer is great for the abv amount. I'm very satisfied with this beer.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 22 oz bombers raved cold into a shaker pint glass. Purchased while in the US the other day. No freshness level given on the bottle.    Appearance - very clear coppery coloured beer with minimal carbonation. Reddish hues. Big two fingers of white head. Some spidery lacing stocks to the glass. Great head retention.    Smell - plenty of citrus, some mango and pineapple loads of caramel and some fine lemon zest. Some peppery notes too.    Taste - some sweet citrusy flavours of mango and pineapple with maybe papaya as well. Hints of dank flavours linger underneath with some zesty lime flavor. Caramel sticks around in the background. Bitterness isn't too prevalent given the huge IBUs.    Mouthfeel - smooth but well carbonated with a juicy finish. Works real nice. Mouthfeel isn't to sticky either.    Overall - a very fine DIPA with great flavor aroma and mouthfeel. One of the best out there and definitely worth a try.

Fairly heavy mouthfeel with a phenomenally bright flavor. Completely lives up to its name with a dominant fresh hop flavor: grassy, sticky, sweet, and a hint of fruitiness. Finishes cleaner than you'd expect. Very solid DIPA, worth a try for any fan of the west coast hop overload.

Tastes like Disneyland feels. Feels like Summer...a good ol' Beach Boys Summer. Overall, it makes up for my horrid Guinness Nitro IPA experience. Reminiscent of Adams' Rebel Rouser...may just be a bit better. I liked it...or, can you tell??

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours Amber in color, 1 finger fluffy white foam. Nice lacing.    Aroma is a classic pine-forward IPA. Super citrusy, tons of floral and resinous pine. You know what you are about to taste.    Taste matches the nose. Clean and crisp pine. Bright and citrusy throughout the sip. Touches of grapefruit juice and rind punch through occasionally to break up the monotony of the floral pine. This is just such a prime example of what a pine-forward west coast IPA should taste like. Bitterness is surprisingly mild... I can't believe it is over 100 ibus! No alcohol detected either.    I enjoy this more than sucks and extra. Solid offering especially for the price. While I'm not a pine-forward IPA guy, I would definitely buy this again as it is just an overall delicious brew! I see it pairing well with pigs in a blanket and Kraft Mac and cheese (classic but delicious!). It gets a 91/100.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Dark amber color, with a two finger bubbly head. Quite clear appearance with only a few small bubbles rising to the top. A beautiful sight.     As one might guess from the name, the hops are fairly prevalent in the smell. I also get a floral kick, I'm thinking fall flowers. Some dark chocolate as well. Even though the hops dominate the smell, there is a lot of complexity here.    Bitter hops dominate the taste, with the tongue tickling pleasantly from the carbonation. Some sweetness and citrus as well. Perhaps a little bit to bitter for my taste. Dry finish.     I really dug this smell. However, I don't feel like the taste was quite as complex as the smell, with the hops dominating the show. Solid taste, with a delightful feel, and a fantastic smell.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 This beer pours like it's from a TV ad. A bright crisp yellow-orange exploding with bubbles below while producing a ridiculous head that leaves every inch of the glass laced. The aroma is pure hops, those calling it dank or musty aren't mistaken, although there is quite a bit of pine along for the ride. The flavor is all hops as well, although a bit of sweetness fights through. The alcohol is not well hidden at all, almost instantly detectable and leaving a dry, warm burn as it finishes. Mouthfeel is fairly sticky, but not as oily as I have come to expect from these big hop beers. It's probably hiding under that alcohol burn.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Deep orange with a big white head and great lacing. Notes of dank, oranges, light pine, grapefruit, and caramel.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Appearance - Medium pour yielded a dark copper colored beer with just over one finger of sparkling fluffy white head. Very modest carbonation is made up for by great retention and a swath of lacing just plastered to the glass.    Smell - Big and boozy, plenty of hops, with a decadent caramel booziness with floral notes and roasted grain in the background.    Taste - Quite sweet, not quite cloying due to lots of malt, tastes like caramel with some floral hops up front too and the roasty grain in behind. Very tasty and well put together. Mild bitterness in the aftertaste.     Mouthfeel - Smooth and sticky and the flavors cling to your mouth and lips. Carbonation is slight and the body is very full.    Overall - An excellently crafted DIPA, that delivered everything I was expecting of it. I was hoping for more of a hop dominated DIPA, but this is smooth and a very easy sipper.

There's a nice hoppy and piney taste up front but a weird bitter floral taste in the back. There's an indescribable feeling back end, sweet, but taste oniony and rotten vegies. Decent beer, but does not compete with the rest of the Lagunitas lineup.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Very balanced with a hop character that is sturdy but has a soft edge and lingers on the back of the tounge. I am not a huge double IPA guy but this is certainly hard to put down.

No over powering alcohol taste and very drinkable for the high alcohol content. Very good price on this brew. For whats involved and how this beer treats you, cant beat it. Lots to enjoy here. I keep getting these for the quality and price. Great Brew!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Bought a $5 bomber yesterday and was stoked to try this beer. Loved everything I've tried from Lagunitas thus far. Nice deep gold color w/ a 2 finger head and good lacing as far as appearance goes. Great smelling beer which consisted of a citrusy/pine combo. But to me......the taste fell short. An herbal, oniony/garlic dankness to it. Grassy, grapefruit, slight citrus. Would like to try again a little fresher.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Beautiful clear orange body. Lots of sticky lace. Good. Intense fruity/piney hops on the nose and palate, yet lacking the sometimes harsh bitterness/minty pine. Plenty of orange rind. All of this is probably heightened by the rather high ABV. A little syrupy/sticky. Mega refreshment, yet I'm still thirsty. Doesn't have the range of hop flavors that the great IPA's do, but it's damn good.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 among the best:  A bright yellow - nice show on the pour - solid 2 finger head and complex lacing settles to a amber film    S hops all the way - world class    T this stands up to the dogfish head standard    M a bit oily in a good way    D sip to savor

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 (bottle code 15 5 2 - poured into a Chouffe tulip)    L: nearly-clear, orange amber liquid with specks of (hop?) sediment... tall, fluffy-spongy, yellowish foam, with lovely retention... beautiful head, but not as much stick to the lace as one would anticipate    S: red grapefruit and pineapple... very potent hop aromas, bit of underlying peppery spice... fragrant fruitiness, moderate thread of sweet, candied ginger... sugar cookie malt pushing out through the back    T: up front: spicy hops, mild-moderate acidity, a low-moderate herbal bitterness, finishing with long trail of caramel-kissed (C 60?) malt... inner grapefruit peel and crystal malt aftertaste, with a hint of dying grass... mellow background wash of raw alcohol in the finish    F: idiosyncratically medium-full body with a foamy, slightly gel-like viscosity... I prefer drier, snappier IPAs - but this is their thing... between the dextrins and resins, this languishes a bit, despite its smoothness    O: not experiencing '102' IBUs here - I know it must be a few months old - but this has to have more of a 'Enjoy-By' approach... still, the hop flavor stands up there with the best... close your eyes, bump this up 2-3% abv more, and you have yourself a West Coast barleywine - not that far off

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours a light copper color with a tight white head that quickly fades to plentiful lacing.  The aroma is dank and piney with hints of citrus and juicy fruit gum.  Taste is big and bitter and dank with some juicy citrus backing it up and a long, bitter, piney and pithy finish.  Mouthfeel is medium and sticky.  Might tasty.

This is a perfectly balanced IPA in my opinion, sweet and bitter are well balanced and the 8% is just right. Sub $5 for the bomber, just another reasonably priced offering from an excellent brewery.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 My favorite from the folks at Lagunitas. A nicer mix between their IPA and Maximus, of which I like and stock both, so that makes it pretty much the epicenter of the hopquake in my cooler. Now get it to me in a more convenient vessel (12oz bottle) and they won't keep it on the store shelf. Why? Cuz I said so. And when you flirt with becoming a full-blown beeralcoholic, you tend to know what it is that you speak of.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a light golden color with a tall white head that leaves plenty of lace.     Smells of sweet citrus - orange, mango - and floral hops.     Taste is sweet orange and mango with a dry middle that has biscuit notes. It finishes with floral and herbal hop bitterness. An very good II IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 The hop punch in the face you've been looking for. Definitely not subtle but also not poorly constructed. It has Laguntias' consistent brewing skills on display albeit with less finesse and more hop aggression. Exhausted my palette after a pint. From a hops-per-dollar perspective it certainly reigns supreme.

Pours a clear golden body with a generous white head that diminishes to just the surface as you drink. Very nice lacing thru out. Smells are strong hops, citrus and either a pine or evergreen. Taste is actually quite strong. Very up front Hops and a slight burst of citrus. Nice bitter after taste with honts some what sweetness. Das Ist Good Yah?! Very delectable Lagunitas. Very well done.

S: The fragrance is just above mid-range with grapefruit and grapefruit rind, spice and malt.   T: Big malt flavors give way to a grapefruit rind bitterness with citrus, herbs and spice, faint cardamom. The brewer places more emphasis on hop flavors and character than on hop bitterness.   F: Creamy medium body, very soft carbonation.   O: A deliscious mix of big hop flavors and big malt with a moderate hop bitterness.

Anyway, had this on draft and was not not disappointed. Very citrus forward and what I detected was a touch of berries. A pretty good, smooth and easy drinking dipa. Wish I could find bottles fresh so I could drink more often.
