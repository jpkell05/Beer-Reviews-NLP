Hints of banana and cloves as well. This beer has a very strong scent, which I really like.     Taste: Immediately, malts, cloves, and pepper, sort of bitter yeast mixed with bittersweet grapefruit and orange peel. Aftertaste is spicy, bready, and a bit boozy.    Feel: Medium body, normal carbonation. Nice warm, dry aftertaste.    Overall: Excellent brew!

look: 3.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Having lived in Brussels for some time, this was my to-go beer for just about every circumstance. It is sold at Belgian supermarkets and groceries stores for about 1,20€ a 33 cl bottle. Lucky me!   First of all, there are some slight batch differences in Duvel (pronounced Doo-ee-vell), with some bottles sporting a clear transparent liquid and others with a small deposit of yeast at the bottom. I advise to turn your bottle slowly to check if there is some sediment and if so, to try to blend it, for it will contribute to a much better aroma.   The look is of more of a golden ale than a blonde one, with thick foam, almost like porter-thick, that grows fast upon pouring. The sediments, when present, gives a slight greyish translucent aspect.   The smell of Duvel is one of the most identifiable beer smells. I could pick it up any time in a blind tasting. It has yeast all over, and a deep sniff will fill your nostrils with a very distinctive hop, giving away what is yet to come upon tasting it.   And indeed, the yeast comes first but not with that typical flavour of bread. It is more of a combination of the yeast with malt, bringing up some faint spicy notes such as cumin, but mainly citrus notes such as a little bit of bergamot, coriander and lemon-grass, and then some heavier notes such as caramel, that combined with the high content of ethanol, gives its particular roundness. The hops then settle in. Not being a strongly hopped beer, the alcohol helps the hop flavours to reach all the corners of your mouth and to explode in contact with the air.   Just remember of the high content of ethanol. It is a very addictive beer, but with one and a half bottle, you'll start to get tipsy!   I think the Duvel brewers have made a very good job keeping a lot of presence and personality in an industrialised beer.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 How have I not reviewed this before? This my standard every single time I'd visit the Kebab Factory 12+ years ago. This 33cl bottle dated 04-2020 I picked up at a supermarket here in Bonaire, Dutch Caribbean. Served in a tapered tumbler. Beer is extremely pale, even for a BPA, and could be mistaken for a Corona -- or as it's known around here, Amstel Bright (except it's in a glass). This one at least forms a nice white lacy head.    Aroma is floral from a combination of hops and yeast. Flavor is harsher/stronger than some Belgian pale ales, with a yeasty bitterness, aggressive carbonation over a creamy body, and orange pith. Good flavor, good style, and wide availability make this a winner, but in my opinion there are plenty in the same genre which are more remarkable: Delirium Tremens, La Chouffe, or my personal favorite, Southampton Grand Cru.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Had years ago, but first repeat since. Pours a fairly clear golden with bit of chill haze and a big fluffy white head that hangs on in big fluffy chunks. The aroma is wonderfully sweet but spicy with prominent banana, all spice, clove on background of fresh bread. Taste follows with banana, bit of citrus, some peppery spiciness and clove, but also hints of piney bitterness and a touch of booziness. Smooth well carbonated mouthfeel with medium body that drinks super easy - quality beer.

Smells of light biscuity malt and fruity esters of green apple, with just a hint of citrus and mellow funk coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, with the fruity and mildly tart apple/pear and just slightly peppery yeast esters in the foreground, complemented by citrus notes, light biscuity malt and just the merest hint of mellow funk. Finishes with a very light bitterness and a very mild funky tartness lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. First off, it's incredibly how easy-drinking this is at 8.5% ABV, with a great balance of mildly tart and spicy fruit esters, citrus notes and very mild funk.

Medium bodied with abundant carbonation, lively in the mouth.

Abilitiy to get drunk comes shortly later. This is the best beer of this kind by far. It might be the only beer of its kind. Others strive to mimic, but only Duvel tastes like Duvel.

I bought it based on the rating and that it was $1 less per bottle than the Delerium Tremens I was going to buy. Since then, I've bought it from another store that is much closer to my home but it doesn't carry DT. Pour it slowly and you will be rewarded with minimal foam and a great aroma.

Very thirst quenching and great mouth feel which does not feel like it is an 8.5% beer; quite a bit tingly on the tongue thanks to the large amount of carbonation. All in all an absolutely brilliant beer and a regular go to for me, especially in the summer.

This actually embodies a nice belgian. 3.8/5   Down scored because let’s face it... it won’t hold up to the greatest in the world and beers like trillium are my barometer. For a beer that is easy to find in the store... A+

Large fluffy white head with great retention. Second glass was much cloudier due to the yeast. Head was smaller and also shorter lived.    Smell - Almost nothing on the nose from the first glass. The second glass had a more funky malt smell.    Taste - The first glass was an amazingly balanced drink, malt forward with a mildly hoppy backend that works together as a cohesive whole. The second glass was similar with a bit more tang from the yeast.    Feel - The strong carbonation gives this wonderfully balanced beer a great lively character. Really feels good on the tongue.    Overall - A truly great beer, very neutral and balanced. Warmer is better than colder, and with yeast is better than without.

Definitely a bit bitter up front. Good amount of wheat, pine, and citrus, but man there is a good amount of bitterness. Really get the feeling I'm sucking on grapefruit peel. I like it.

This would go great in the spring & summer time of the year. That high abv is hidden consummately. It's classy & champagne like & sweet but it's still not better than a lot of German wheat beers that I have had. The sweetness can be a tad bit cloying. Cheers! B

However I'd like to forewarn there is a difference between bottle conditioned and biere conditioned. One tastes a lot better, I always forget which and it's hard to clarify. When you get the right one it's the best beer on earth.

look: 2.5 | smell: 1.75 | taste: 1.25 | feel: 1.25 | overall: 1.75 This beer disapointed me greatly. A fuzzy/cloudy yellow color presented itself with a thick head. The smell was of strong malt. The taste was disgusting and was a mix of flavors, it had different fruity flavored malts which went to war against grainy flavors. It was like somebody mixed 3 random beers together. The finish was rough. I expected to like this beer as it had solid reviews and was excited to try it, but it let me down. I decided to try it again, and it was still garbage.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Finally reviewing this one, bottle BB 12/2018:  Pours a lovely golden with a light chill haze (and yellow with a murkier haze if proper decanting is not done). Of course, the cumulonimbus cloud of white head is a well-known property of this beer. This falls into rocky peaks in an interesting near-geologic study. Lacing isn't as heavy as expected, but is quite strong.    The nose is a nicely balanced combination of sweet-leaning orchard fruit and a grassy to very lightly piney hop note. There's not much more complexity than that, but that simple recipe is very enticing.    Taste starts with a light, white cracker malt note. Upon this is layered a thin spread of apple butter. This provides the base upon which a spritz of citrus is added (with a little more tang when the dregs are included). The carbonation isn't as powerful as expected, but is in multitude with each sip. This might aid the pepper notes that come on as we transition towards the back of the beer. The orchard fruit becomes citrus pith as the bitterness starts to gain, combined with the pepper, there's a combined zesty bitterness here.    No surprise, just a well put together pale ale that is medium dry in the end. No frills because none are needed - a moderately complex beer without any extremes.

Beautiful light malt backbone with a light, estery flavor; alcohol builds up slowly yet never overpowers the overall taste; very subtle sweetness off-setting the hops and alcohol. Relatively light body; powdery; dry finish overall.    This is a strong beer with character. It exudes a kind of lightness in mouthfeel while also delivering a lot of depth and balance with great flavors. Well-rounded, easy drinking (for a relatively high ABV), and quite satisfying.

Supernatural retention. Unbelievable lacing. Moderate to high carbonation.    S- Hops. Yeast. Maybe lemon/ citrus/ something? Maybe? I'm not exactly sure and this isn't my first time having this beer.    T - Strong and lingering but pungent and enjoyable. Weird beer in the best way possible.    M - Not clean, not crisp. Lingering- in a good way.    D - Duvel is one of the prettiest beers I've ever seen poured. Bar none. It is a supermodel beer. It is also definitely drinkable. Unfortunately, that's where my love affair with Duvel ends.. It's a good beer but I don't think it's an amazing beer. Sure, it is totally unique and high strength and for that it gets points. With that being said, if I'm drinking for enjoyment, there are other offerings that I enjoy more. It's a little overrated.

Bottle to snifter.    LOOK: Light yellow; big foamy head.  AROMA: belgian yeast, esters, touch of citrus, touch of banana   TASTE: balance of hop and malt, touch of banana with the yeasty flavors.  FEEL: thin body, but a sturdy head keeps it creamy, excellent carbonation.    A classic. I think I can appreciate this more now. Still not my type of beer, but you can notice attributes here that are similar to great heavier belgians.    **

look: 1 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 | overall: 4 Review: 330ml Bottle of Duvel: ABV: 8.5%    Like the cutesy small stubby brown bottle, with the well known Duvel brand. Ideally to be drank in a tulip glass as all good Belgian ales should be, but I am not a connoisseur just a regular beer dude so an ordinary beer glass will just have to do. Sorry!    Got a massive head on pour, gee whiz a very big frothy head!     Good bit of carbonation, nice creamy white top, took a while to settle.     Colour was cloudy orange, doesn’t look great at all, looks shit in fact.    Head collapses and dies.    Some good lacing……..    On the nose has that usual Belgian ale smell, wheat, the yeast, the coriander, floral hops, fruits of lemon and banana. A very typical Belgian!    A very strong intense smell, really powerful stuff on the nose….which is too be welcomed as I usually smell fuck all from my beers, lol!    On the taste I found it very strong, with a sour taste, very bitter aftertaste and can definitely feel the beer. Yeast and firm hop bitterness. Very strong, got a powerful kick, alright.    Didn’t initially like it at all, but in the end I liked it, took a while for my taste buds to get to enjoy this beer. Found it a slow burner and not bad overall.    Wow, I was buzzing after the two. The 8.5% definitely kicks in.     Nice, I like it, strong to drink, but it does the business in the end.   Have a few of these and you are off your head!!!    One of the strongest I have had in a while.

Looks damn good with three fingers of stark white, fine foam plastered over a lively and clear golden body. The head is long lasting and has fantastic lacing that stacks up like shaving cream on the side of the tulip.    The nose is moderate in strength with light white grape and fresh lemon aromas over yeast and spice. Taste is dry and clean and is in line with the nose. Balanced and refined it finishes dry and slightly tart. Mouth feel is crisp then frothy, with fairly high carbonation that brings a bit of bite before finishing smooth.    Recommended, even if Belgian beers aren't your thing.

There's rich fruitcake in there alongside the farmyard notes. Flavour complements the smell, with only a touch of bitterness offsetting the sweetness. Savouring a longer sip reveals some candied and sherbet flavours Too carbonated for my taste but not for the style.

Poured with a huge, billowy, bright white foam that hung on to the bitter end. Sweet pilsner malt aromas with candy suger, floral hops, light peppery notes and touch of booze at the end. Medium light bodies with effervescent carbonation. Light creaminess beneath the aggressive carbonation followed by unmistakeable, pleasant, boozy warmth through the finish. Flavors of pilsner malt, sweet sugar, light under ripe banana, bready yeast and spicy pepper. Medium light bitterness through the middle tempers the sweetness fillowed by light floral hoppiness. Finished with some boozy warmth along with floral and peppery notes that linger a bit. Dangerously drinkable and refreshing considering the higher abv. A wide array of flavors, aromas and feel that combine perfectly.

Look: Poured a pale, clear golden ale into a tulip glass that foams with a good 2 inches of white head. Abundant lacing and head retention.  Smell: Lemon, grass, coriander.  Taste: Spicy, lemon, tart finish  Feel: Crisp start that extends into sour funk. Very smooth.  Overall: It's a pleasure to swirl this beer around the mouth picking out the abundance of flavors. If anything predominates for me it might be the sour funk on the finish. Not that it is overpowering. A very mature tasting beer.

Then, for lack of better description, I get a saison like spiciness followed by some alcohol presence. OMG. Love this stuff.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 No problem giving this a high score.    Drank from 750ml bottle sourced from Belgium (and dated 7/2017) into teku. Was concerned when I saw the date, presumably an expiration date, a month from now, but was not disappointed.    If you like foamy beer, this is for you! Poured from the bottle 4 times; each time was more careful to pour so as to limit foam production. Each time failed. Has a lemony orange clear color with a thick white frothy head that lasts longer than usual. It looks like something you would really like to try.     I wouldn't say the taste is strong compared to some other "burly" beers, but it is smooth and elegant, with a nice bitter finish. Bottle lists some of the hops used, which were unfamiliar to me. Yeast flavor is mild, but Belgian-type. Malt flavor is difficult to detect.    Top marks for a very smooth and drinkable ale!

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 330mL bottle into a fat-bottomed tulip  L- Surprisingly it is clear when coming out of bottle but settles into a hazy, muted gold when in glass. Has good carbonation with a thin white head sitting on top.  S- Spice, clove, cinnamon, garlic, lemon zest, peach, parsley, caramel, dark fruit, yeast, grass. Very complex.  T- Similar to notes as smell. Nice balance between sweet and spice with a nice creaminess carrying it to the finish.   F- Incredibly smooth and bounces on your taste buds.  O- A well balanced, quality beer that is rightfully a classic.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a golden bronzed yellow color with a slight transparency about it. Carbonation could be seen rising at a moderate pace to fill a finger's worth of white foamy head, somewhat fizzy but holding. Once it fell off, sly messy lace ran around my glass.  The aroma had a beautiful blend of sweet grass, Belgian yeasty/breadiness, light clove, floral hop bits, touch of herbal and some light Belgian candied fruits.  The flavor blended wonderfully between the sweetness to the spice and creating a well blended smooth aftertaste.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a fine sipping quality about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt fine.  Overall, pretty nice Belgian strong ale always lovely to have at practically any time of the year.

The beer pours a mildly hazy orange yellow color with prolific off white head. Lacing is strong from top to bottom. The aroma as this warms is apple, pear and slight generic Belgian smells. The flavor is fruity with mild tartness playing off sharp carbonation. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sharply carbonated and finishes dry. Overall, very good. I'm not sure the age of this but I believe this is best enjoyed fresh. It's nice, but not worth the premium over some craft options.

Very delicate on the palate, and the high alcohol content does not give this a boozy aftertaste. One of these days I will have to do a head-to-head comparison with Orval, which is a very similar Belgian ale, to see which one I like the best. I hope I like Duvel better because it is a lot cheaper than Orval.

look: 4.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 This is the first beer I've had whose head actually *increases* in size in the minutes following the pour. Looks like a highly effervescent champagne. Head is big, pillowy, and solid white. Awesome retention and moderate lacing. Grains, mild malts, and some yeast esters on the nose. Taste is much more doughy, with the same AAL-like graininess I picked up on in the aroma. Crisp mouthfeel, a little puckering on the finish. Overall very refreshing summertime sipper, but because of the importing/shipping costs, the price is pretty prohibitive in MA at ~$16/4-pack. Better without bottom sediment mixed in    85/100   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Beautiful hazy golden yellow with huge foamy head. Smells of ripe bananas, pear, a little orange and grapefruit, a little spice and yeast and wheat. Goes down absolutely smooth with no alcohol detected despite being over 8%. Taste follows the nose, with a nice little bready biscuity taste as well and a slight hop bitterness. Light-medium body with medium-high carbonation that adds to the crispness and cleanness. No unpleasant aftertaste though it does finish dry. Nearly perfect.

Alcohol has a gentle warmth towards the end and goes perfect with the spice. Finishes dry.   Feel - Medium bodied, loads of fine bubbles, dry finish with soft alcohol warmth.

Very similar to look at, crystal clear pale blonde brew with decent foamage at its crown.    Not sure there is a massive Aroma to speak of, I genuinely can't pick anything out, seems to nullify itself.     The taste is definitely on the fruity side, and the 8.5% abv is noticed, but not excessively so. The aftertaste is gone in a flash, and this is a very easy to drink brew.    I think I find it difficult to call this a top top brew due to it's availability and very cheap price. Just over 1 euro for a 330ml bottle, and stocked everywhere in Northern Europe.    That aside, it is a decent beer, and was certainly my first experience of a true none draft Belgian Beer.    Overall just Very Good.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Appearance: So perfect and precise, they had to make their own style tulip glass. Beautiful large head with a golden yellow and visible carbonation rising from the center. Has a similar appearance to champange.  Smell: Dominated by spice and alcohol on the front and followed by a mild fruitIness followed by bitterness. Very refreshing finish and a complex character for scent  Taste: A combination of bitter hoppiness matched with a mild fruity and refreshing dry finish. An incredible hybrid between a Beligen pale ale and close to champagne like. One of my favorite combination of flavors.  Feel: Crisp and carbonated but takes it time through your mouth. A great natural feel that is very easy to drink but has all of the complexities of a full bodied beer.  Overall: An all-time classic and blue print for how all beers should be. This has always been one of my favorites since first sip. You can say you lived without drinking many beers, but not this one. Duvel is a beer that all beer drinkers deserve to drink at some point in their life.

Some peaches, yeasty-spicy phenols (cloves) and nice amount of floral hops. Very citric. Flavor follows all scents. Well balanced and dry. Very fresh. Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. Creamy later watery. Long dry finish with strong bitterness at the end. Some spiciness, maybe grittiness. Perfectly warms a throat. High alcohol grade well covered.    Fantastic beer.

Pours hazy with a HUGE pillowy head. And when I say HUGE, I'm not kidding.This is BY FAR the biggest head I've seen on a beer so far, and it lasts for a very long time, which adds to the experience in my opinion. The taste is just what you expect from a belgian golden. Taste reminds me of apples for some reason, which is a good thing since I love apples. In my opinon, you haven't drunk beer until you drank Duvel. A great, great beer!

White grape, pears, and green apple or apple cider are the three prominent notes. A touch of the farm yard scent, as well. The beer is a very hazy golden apricot up to the light with a ton of tiny bubbles rising and a monster whipped egg white head that lasts and clings to the glass in like soap. In the flavor, white wine like, loads of green apple, a little funky, pears for days. The feel is medium body, dry, and an Alka-seltzer like carbonation effect. First time having this. Really an enjoyable experience for me.

Smells of grain and yeast. Reminds me of feed barrels in my grandfathers barn and bread.  Taste is awesome! Can taste apples, grain, yeast and hay. Sorta funky in a very good way.  As for feel++very carbonated/fizzy, but good.  This is a great beer! I will buy again as a treat to my self.  Wish it were less expensive at $15 for 4 pack.   Great, great beer!!!   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 I'll avoid redundancy, considering the number of reviews already here.    To me, this is very, very refined for the style. Nothing is present that doesn't belong or required. The yeast certainly carries the day.    I prefer my beer/ale not too cold, and opened a 750ml bottle at 60F. It gushed. The other bottle which was refrigerated at ~42F did not. Not a complaint, just a commentary on the degree of carbonation. Cheers!

Duvel is considered the paradigm of the style, and it's easy to see why. First of all, Duvel smell the way a beer should, and the tastes has a distinct and appealing character. This was a worthwhile experience.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3.75 From notes taken 12/16/16:    Have had this for about a year, from a four-pack. Unfortunately, I didn’t review my first one which I enjoyed back in January, and this is only my second. I am using a Duvel chalice/tulip I managed to pick up recently. Semi-clear, swirling with fine haze, metallic straw gold, capped in three inches of pure white seemingly weightless fluff that suggests effervescence. Moderately tart aromas, of vinegar and phenol, but also influenced by grain and booze. Main flavors are somewhat harsh grain and spiciness (from yeast or brewing spices or both?), strong Band-Aid, some lemony tartness. Balanced by fairly sweet malt and booze. Good but it is still a little too harsh for me, though appropriate for the style. I prefer darker and either more overt fruitiness or spiciness for my Belgians, not so much vinegar or medicinal phenol. Retro-olfaction is my second-favorite thing about this beer, just boozy and slightly spicy. My favorite part is the mouthfeel. Light to medium in body, thin for mere moments but level of fine effervescence passes it off as creamy, warming.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 11.2 oz. bottle    Pours foggy hazy yellow gold with a dense creamy white foam head.

Lovely peppery, clove, and subtle sweet aromas carry over perfectly to compliment an earthy and grassy addition in the flavor. Silky smooth, and light enough feeling to make this well balanced beer go down exceptionally well. Overall, this is a world class Belgian golden ale. Cheers!

look: 5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 I give the look of this beer a 5 because after pouring it into a tulip my beer looked just like the picture on the back of the bottlecand therefore this is the look the brewers intended.  Very foamy beer that sticks with it through the whole experience. A one of a kind for sure that has a liquor, mildly banana, mildly clove flavor with a tiny resemblance to chimay but I'd still prefer chimay. It's a bit like champagne and definitely had its wit appearance and flavor. And it is good for a hot summer day and very drinkable at 8.5abv. Very creamy and sweet with rum undertones. But must give credit where credit is due and that is this beer ages well. Had this again recently from a bottle dated from 2004 that was good til Aug. 2017; and, consumed it mid July 2017, held up very well and may have even improved.

And while he is no beer expert, he knew he was drinking something very special, and something worth savoring.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 330ml bottle into a 350ml beer glass - the usual massive fluffy white Belgian beer head and lots of lacing - very pale golden colour.    Nose is malty sweet with a hint of spice, a little bready and spicy.    Lovely light spicy palate with some nice bready malt and some spice.    Mouth is good despite the light body - very easy to drink but alcohol coming through - not a hge problem at 8%.    Overall a very well made beer - great balance, complex and very easy to drink. Highly recommended.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Poured--from a 330 ml/11.2 oz short. Relatively newly born--August 2016, so only two months old.    Look--Classic unfiltered cloudy (just beyond hazy) and pale-gold. Big rocky head, more like a wit than a Belgian strong. The head has some serious staying power, and the lacing is creamy and fabulous throughout. This is just a stupdenous-looking beer.    Aroma--Perhaps a bit subdued in the aroma department compared to some of its fellows, but still very complex. Fruity aromas mixed with spice and just-there maltiness.    Taste--The first word that comes to mind, sip after sip, is balance. In every possible way. Malty sweet. And fruity sweet. Yet just-so on the bitterness. There is also an herbal or spice note that combines with a distinctively strong carbonation to provide a dry kick to finish. The alcohol is definitely there, but strictly as a pleasing and additional drying element--no bite or burn.     Feel--Difficult to separately quantify or qualify from the taste, because it is such a strong component of that aspect. Wonderful carbonation and warming booziness provides a fine drying finish to a complex flavor. "Crisp" doesn't do this justice.     Overall--Everything that makes me favor the Belgian/Flemish approach to brewing is here and then some. If you haven't--you must and soon.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Pours a slightly murky gold with a big foamy head and high carbonation. Aroma is a little spicy or funky but not out of the ordinary for a Belgian golden. Taste was much of the same with a candy like sweetness while still being dry and crisp. I had read a bit about this beer and my expectations were a bit off as this was very subtle and there was no heavy handed funkiness like you might get from some other beers fermented with Brett. All in all this was a very easy to drink, balanced, enjoyable beer. One of the few beers I've had where the flavor has been very interesting and fulfilling while not being over the top.

CRAZY SOFT FOAMY CLOUD-LIKE HEAD.   FIRST POUR TASTE - ahh just OK. Maybe cause I'm not a fan of the Pilsners base?     Second half of the bottle - grew on my taste buds. Like drinking a dry Champagne-ish beer - if there is such a thing.     In any case - Duvel is co-brewed at OMMEGANG (spelling?) brewery in Cooperstown SO that is an AWESOME THING!!!!

Either way, hot stuff.    Same with the taste, super amount of alcohol and phenolic yeast. Bitterness is higher than desired. So much of that phenolic spice rack going on. The citric acidity in the mouthfeel seems to bring out the alcohol and sting even more.     Throw me in the unpopular opinion thread, but in Murica, we want our pale ales to have more discernable barley and hops as opposed to yeast and alcohol. YMMV.

It has been a wonderful 7.25 years 0n this site, and I really appreciate the world of beer it has opened up to me. Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of yeast, spice, fruit. Taste is spices, malts, light fruits, alcohol makes it presence felt. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer, but I was left feeling a bit disappointed.

Appearance: Slightly hazy but bright, pale golden yellow. Towering clouds of lasting, white sudsy foam, thick and creamy - almost like whipped cream - coats the glass with clumpy lace. Visibly effervescent.    Smell: Bright lemon zest, apple peel, fresh baguette, delicately spicy yeast.    Taste: Complex layers of malty grains, fruity esters, honey, black pepper, balancing bitterness and slight bite of alcohol.    Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy medium body and lively carbonation.    Overall: Possibly the best looking beer I've ever poured from a bottle. Complex and flavorful - a classic.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours a slightly hazy yellow golden with a frothy, rocky, ever lingering head. Bready malt, drinks very smoothly and finishes dry.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 25 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.    L: The label says to pour slowly, and you better believe it! A slow pour yields a very clear light-gold or yellow color, and a voluptuous pure-white frothy head. Excellent head retention, and the lacing was amazing. A beautiful beer to look at. The 2nd pour was a little hazier, due to the remaining yeast in the bottle.    S: Very fruity with some yeast/bread notes.    T/F: Very complex flavoring, mostly following the smell. Lots of fruit, balanced with the yeast and bread. Has some spiciness at the end. Didn't really notice much of a hops presence, but that is probably because I'm used to a very upfront IPA hop flavor. Clean and dry finish.    O: Excellent beer. I've been mostly drinking American style beers, leaning toward the IPA side, and this was one of my first tries at Belgian beer. Obviously not as hoppy as an IPA, but a very clean and drinkable. This one goes down smooth, and can pack a punch. I didn't even realize it was 8.5% ABV until looking at the bottle after feeling a little tipsier than I thought I should.

The taste is a sweet pear, followed by citrus, pepper spice, and a malty bitterness that is not too strong.  The alcohol is not noticeable.   The feel is not too thick or thin and watery.

I feel ashamed that it has taken me until now to drink & review this venerable classic. 8=( In fact, the last time that I remember drinking it was during a field trip to BAL with Bob & Karen Hollman, Sheesh! That's gotta be close to a decade or more at this point in time.     From the stubby bottle (that will be rinsed & set aside for use as a Molotov cocktail shaker): "Belgian Golden Ale Bottle Conditioned"; "Patience - In Your Pour - Ness"; "If you've ever done something in a hurry, you know it often ends in disappointment - and sometimes a full body cast. So here's to an unhurried pour. Not only will it release Duvel's essential aromas, you can use the time to write a short poem: 'Pour slow there you go.' On second thought, no poetry, please."; "Share your #masterfulness ".    I Pop!ped the cap and went with a very gentle pour as directed. I know that it may be hard to believe, but I actually can follow directions. It is simply that I just choose NOT to do so. Even a gentle pour brought forth three-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with good retention. The remaining lacing was spectacular. Color was a slightly hazy Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4). Nose had a dry mustiness, like those old newspapers up in my grandmother's attic. I really do mean to bundle them up and put them out for recycling one of these days. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a pleasant effervescence on the tongue. The taste had a light tartness, like green apples. Boy, howdy, it is one dry beer! Phew! Just one sip later and I felt really parched. Man, I am all for dry beers, but this one is almost vinous, like a really dry white wine. Finish had a long, lingering dryness that led me to hear the zephyr winds blowing across the sands of the Sahara. And I still have half of the bottle yet to pour! Wow. Plus, I am doing a side-by-side today with their Tripel Hop Ale (Belgian IPA).

Voluminous snow-white head with retention that even Turritopsis dohrnii would be jealous of.     Besides that, I didn't really like it. I am a huge fan of trappist ales and this Duvel just tasted bizarre. Not necessarily lacking flavor, the flavor was just very dry and lacking in any big barrel characteristics. For the price, I would not recommend it. Stick to a Maharaja.

Strong aroma, maybe a bit too pepperish and malted. The taste is very characteristic, you can definitely taste the 8.5vol in it's dry end. It has a bit of malted smell that is complemented with some notes of citrus mixed with spices, the mouth end is very bready, malty and somewhat bitter in a pleasent way. A complex, different and very likely recommended beer experience. If you see it, don't hesitate, just go for it.

Nose is a spicy, herbal hop profile. The smell has a lot going on similar to a hefeweizen. Bananas, cloves, bubblegum. Belgian yeast in the taste, and all follows the nose very well. Bananas, cloves, and more of that spicy herbal kick with linger around for a while. Mouthfeel has relatively medium to high carbonation, and an overall easy sipper.

Nose of candy malt, light bubblegum, subtle citrus notes, and light herbal notes of clove with a healthy dose of classic Belgian yeast. Flavors exceed the nose with candy touched citrus notes on the front and middle featuring lemon zest and light banana flavors from the yeast, more candy on the sides and then a nice warming glow from the strength of the alcohol. Crisp and effervescent mouth feel, excellent carbonation, and a dry finish. Overall an excellent ale from a great brewer.    Cheers

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from 750 ml bottle into tulip glass. Despite pouring "gently," I produced an enormous, frothy, milk-white head that puffed up and looks like gelato. The color is a hazy gold straw with significant bubbling. It has a champagne look. It smells of Belgian yeast, clove, and lemon peel, and a whiff of sweeter fruit. The taste is sweeter than the smell with banana and some honey, along with lemon, coriander, clove, pepper, and malt. All the flavors blend beautifully to produce a full taste experience. This ale is highly carbonated, crisp, dry, and the 8.5% ABV is barely noticeable. Overall, it is easy to see why Duvel is considered world class. It really has no flaws.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Color is a nice hazy straw-gold. Head is white and seems rather weak; lacing is minimal. Nose offers a blend of bready and spicy yeast notes, with some floral and fruity aspects moving through as well. Taste likewise offers spicy, bready, and tingly flavors, and a little honey sweetness as well, all twirling together. Perhaps some bananas or other tropical fruit are hiding in there and coming out for a peek also. Given the sweet, spicy, and bready flavor, the tongue is left feeling surprisingly clean and dry once the beer is gone. Great beer. I'm surprised that the head was somewhat weak in my bottle, or the rating could have been even higher.    Drink-by date was 11 2016, and I had this on Drink with the Duvel Day, 4 June 2016.

Hop aroma, malty with spice accents.  Taste: like aroma, notes of malt and hops combined with spices and herbs. It is slightly peppery, spicy.  Hop bitterness at the finish, not too intense, dry and clear peppermint. Saturation high, fits. Alcohol perfectly hidden.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pours a stunningly clear and bright straw yellow with a two finger head of fluffy foam.    Toasted biscuits, slightly herbal spicy hop character, banana, clove, and slightly lemony citrus character.    Bananas, lemon, clove, peppercorn, biscuits.    Light-bodied, high carbonation, soft, creamy smooth, prickly carbonation.    Overall, a truly world class Belgian and worth every penny. Incredibly drinkable for 8.5%, it would be too easy to have a few too many.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Pours a slightly hazy golden wheat color. Lots of small bubbles course upwards indicating decent carbonation. Two finger white head slowly dissipates leaving sticky lacing along the glass and a thin foamy head.    Smell has aromas of yeast, bread dough, wheat, slight hints of citrus zest and a slight peppery smell. Undertones of clove, spice, and coriander come through.    Taste is initially kind of yeasty and doughy - lots of wheat and bread notes come through, however this is quickly tinged by a nice citrus zest flavor eventually giving way to a slightly peppery and spiced yeast finish. Slight booze taste becomes apparent after sipping for a while, but even then it is sublet and quite nice.     Feel has a nice robust carbonation that somehow does not overpower the flavors. Very smooth, crisp and refreshing.    Overall this beer is amazing in and of itself, but rated against Belgian Strong Pale Ales - this is the standard that all others aspire to be.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Light clear yellow color with World class cap and lacing.    Aroma is like sticking your nose into a bouquet of fragrant tea roses. Speaking as an amateur rosarian I can say that. As an amateur cook I can also find Herbes de Provence, particularly lavender. I can't think of any other beer that has such a delightful fragrance.    Taste is marvelous. This is so good on so many levels it's hard to find a place to start. Floral hoppiness is in perfect balance with the rest. Malt is rich without being heavy, sweet without being cloying, full while remaining clean and a perfect example of when just enough is enough. Malt, yeast and hops all work together in a harmonious complexity that is seamless from start to finish.     Texture is medium.    Overall this is a head and shoulders above the rest sort of beer. A blazing pathfinder that still out distances it's many imitators.

The head reduced slowly leaving some dynamic lacing. The smell is yeasty, fruity (apples, pears) and spicy. The taste follows suit with some medium hop bitterness tangling with a peppery bite. The feel is dry and a bite thin. Overall, this one earns it's classic status.

The notable thing coming back to this after years of trying many other Belgian beers is how impeccably clean-tasting it is. There's almost none of that Belgian "funk" (which I sometimes love) and all of the complex flavours -- this time around I picked up a flowery scent, some black pepper, pears and green apples, and freshly baked white bread, in particular -- just seem so bright and un-muddied.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Duvel Belgian Golden Ale, 8.5% ABV, 32 IBU, style Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Pours thin, hazy golden with huge persistent white foamy head, decent lacing. It was 80% head when first poured but took a while to get a decent picture. Not picking up much for nose, taste is malt, a bit bitter, a bit sour. I note it is highly rated, but for me it's just OKish.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours an opaque yellow, with a thick, bubbly, white head. Head retention is strong, with good lacing left behind. Aroma is of Belgian yeast spice, dark fruits, and raisin. Taste is Belgian yeast spice, with dark fruits. Very rich and complex flavor. Mouth feel is medium thick, with good mouth coating and filling characteristics. Overall, it's a lovely brew that makes for great sipping and enjoyment.     Served in a 12oz snifter.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Pours an enormous and very fluffy head, probably the largest I've seen. Has a light golden color that is slightly murky. The aroma is very yeasty, and a bit spicy as well, with some hops thrown in also. The first sip tasted like champagne, likely exaggerated with the high carbonation. From there it started to taste more beer-like, yet very yeasty the entire time. Crisp and mellow, and nice for sipping slowly, yet not necessarily my style. As mentioned, a lot of carbonation, but with a pleasant feel in the mouth. Overall I respect this beer and its high quality. I think it's something that every beer lover should try. That being said, it was quite a pricey bottle and I'm not sure I would personally value it as high as I paid. A lover of Belgians would probably disagree with me.

This combination contributes more to promoting the Belgian tradition in America than any other factor. As a Belgo-phile and quasi-evangelist, I admire both as greatly as I know how.     Duvel is reviewed in "Michael Jackson's Great Beers of Belgium" in which he describes it for 5 pages and uses it to define his entire chapter called "Wicked Ales." Read the chapter (or at least those 5 pages) to know how we should be reviewing.    Then in his 2003 "The Brewmasters' Table", Garrett Oliver continues this tradition saying "Ardently imitated, but never quite equalled, Duvel is the sole progenitor of the strong golden ales". My experience is that he is quite correct in pairing Duvel with garlicky foods whereby the bubbles and hops clean the palate for the next bite. I am eager to try his suggestion of pairing with Indian and Thai spices.    Following the lead of two master reviewers and completing the highest accolades of any ale I know, Duvel is also listed in the global listing "1001" and certainly deserves to be there.  Across the Channel, Duvel is reviewed at length in Roger Protz's "300 Beers", published by CAMRA.    As for my review? Well, I stand on the shoulders of giants and 2,828 other reviews. The best compliment I can make is that even the one or two things that I could suggest that might improve Duvel probably should not be changed. Duvel sets such a high standard that to change it will diminish the category. If any brewer matches this strong golden, as a Belgo-phile, I will be certain that I have gone to Heaven. And if I end up going to Hell, it will not be because I loved this incorrectly named ale.

I find myself trying too hard to compare it to La Fin Du Monde, a Belgian triple not a pale ale, seeking some sort of clove tint. Very clean drinking beer all in all. Cheers

Golden hazy beautiful beer, big fluffy pillow of a head that sticks around for the entire duration of the beer. Some nice Belgian yeast on the smell, kind of like a La Fin du Monde, but much more pale. Taste is light, inoffensive, and bright. As others stated a little pepper like with the classic Belgian yeast. Carbonation is at a perfect level like champagne, not sure how it is so dialed in but the feel is incredible on this beer. A near perfect medium that succeeds in many different aspects and fails at none. Alcohol is devilishly hidden. Glad I was able to cop a few so cheap, these are expensive and I feel blessed.

It was a nice surprise. Again, a little peppery, which may be accentuated by the higher abv. A clean grainy flavor.       Feel - High volumes of co2 of course. Velvet, dry, cloudy mouthfeel.     Overall - It deserves its world class distinction. It had more pepper than I would like, but as far as style goes it is sensational.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 This brew gets a lot of praise but, for my tastes, it's way down the list of Belgian Beers that I'd order.    It is a pale straw yellow, which begins clear and then the chill haze takes it.  It has abundunt white head and foam, initially, but it quickly dissipates into thin and non-clingy leavings.    The aroma is all yeast up front. The flavor is full of banana-like esters, and clove notes; more yeast on the palate, but the 8.5% alcohol is well hidden.  There is a short period of sweetness after sipping, but it becomes sour and then goes bitter after that.    Even still, it's a very drinkable beer. But I can think of three other Belgian Strong Pale Ales that I'd rather have.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 The Duvel (Devil) lives up to its name, please have a seat especially if you're drinking the 75cl bottle. It's 8,5% ABV and delivers the most beautiful head with the proper glassware, Triple Karmeliet close second. It's tasty, complex and balanced. It's the kind of beer you want to do a marathon on, and that you will for sure buy again. World-class

I would never ever guess this is 8.5 ABV; tastes so good you should sip it but it sure goes down easy.

Nice malt upfront light peppery lemon finish. The thing that is amazing is this beer retained a 2 finger head for a solid 30 minutes. Will definitely have this beer in the future. One of the better looking beers that taste damned good

Crisp bright flavor with a light mouth feel. I personally felt this one was a little deceptive on the alcohol side in that I couldn't tell it was 8.5%. This is a beer I would drink after shoveling the driveway... or maybe a few. Refreshing.

look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours clear and gold, huge white head and very visible carbonation. Another review described the smell as a tire fire and I'll be damned if that's not a fair description. Not scared though, got some citrus smells and I've had it before so I know it's good. Light body, but that carbonation is a mouthful. Dry, crisp and super smooth; I could drink this all night, what booze?    Finishes super clean with just a touch of bitterness lingering on the tongue. This may not be the sexiest old girl, but she's worth bumping into from time to time.

Smell: herbal hops, a bit spicy, grassy and floral.    Taste: malty, spicy, sweet and dry, but all very balanced, addictive.     Mouthfeel: highly carbonated but so creamy and smooth it makes you want drink more and more.    Overall: delicious, amazing beer, as I said, it's addictive. This is really good beer.

Any complexity or fruity character is masked by the overall harshness of the dominant flavors and aroma.

T/F: Belgian yeasts are all over this brew... complex esters with an almost fruity-citrus character without being sweet. Mild hop bite... just enough to keep things honest. Spicy character. Light and creamy on the mouth... carbonated yet smooth.     O: This is a delicious and complex beer, and one that's meant to be sipped and savored. You can't go wrong with Duvel, and it's one of the Belgian standards for a reason.

Aroma of fruity esters, floral hops, and bread. Taste follows the nose with a slightly tart yeast, floral hops, spicy hops, and biscuit taste before the dry finish. Medium-full body and medium carbonation. The alcohol is completely hidden and the feel is creamy and luscious.  The feel is what really makes this beer. Everything is well done, but the creaminess and hidden alcohol make this a gem. I could really savor this and I don't see how this beer could get old.

But now that I've tried it I believe it's worth every penny. I was actually able pick up two bottles along with a Duvel glass gift packaged for $8 ! This is classified as a Belgian Pale Ale but personally I have no trouble considering this a tripel. Gorgeous golden appearance along with a crisp feel. Tastes like a tripel and is comparable to many fine Belgians that are out there as well as La Fin Du Monde. Overall, just a fantastic Belgian even if I'm confused by the style.

Beautiful lacing and a clouded pale straw color to the beer itself.    Smell -- Fruity esters lend a banana and clove nose to the beer. No alcohol whatsoever in the nose.    Taste -- Banana and clove again, hints of bubblegum buried in there as well. Initial sweetness quickly gives way to a delightful bitterness that persists just long enough for you to take another sip. Alcohol is hidden.    Feel -- Creamy on the tongue due to the carbonation. The body is light, surprisingly so given the ABV.    Overall -- A beautiful beer. It looks good. It smells good. It tastes good. It feels good. It's the beer equivalent of sex in a glass. A wonderful brew. It may be possible for it to be improved but I'm new enough to the style to feel unqualified to offer any suggestions.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 My brother in law slipped me a couple of these with the tulip glass and told me "best beer I've ever had." Now he knows his German and Belgian beers so I listened. The next thing I did was check out the reviews here. I get a little skeptical when something scores this well because my tastes tend to run a little differently than others. Porters and light stouts are my favorites. Anyway, I chilled them and got ready. I screwed up the pouring a little and wound up with way too much head so I had to wait a bit but it was worth it. I'll let the other guys give all the flowery evaluations of subtle notes and such and tell you that this is the ale that all other ale makers should shoot for. It's light, clean, and refreshing but somehow doesn't skimp on flavor. I don't mean that over-hopped crapped that's all the rage these days but real beer flavor. On my beer tasting list I've got a category for beers I would drink every day and this one made it. Saving the other one for another day until I can find some more.

I cannot stress how important it is to pour this beer correctly, or the suds will be quite overwhelming. Pours a light golden, with a very creamy, foamy, and thick head that does not go away. Ive seen some reviews of this beer in that it dissipates quickly and does not lace. This is because it was poured incorrectly. The lacing on this beer is extreme, almost can't see through the glass at times. The nose is very complex, a lot of deep fruit notes. First thought on the tongue, wow. So much going on here. You can almost pick any note out of this one. It's Duvel, it's well known and popular for a reason.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This was poured into, none other, a Duvel tulip. Hey, go figure.  The appearance was a hazy golden color with a finger's worth of foamy white head. While the head caves out a bit to allow a mushroom cap of a head, the dissipation picks up the pace in the wake and barely any lacing is seen. Its always a nice show to watch a Duvel head die off.  The aroma takes some banana, apple, lemon and Belgian spices to tighten a grip over some Belgian sugars. To sweeten the pot, gentle sweet grassy and earthy hops slide in to balance an overall wonderful unprecedented complexity.  The flavor yields a full sweetness coming from the fruity esters, and Belgian sugars colliding into the spices to build an eventful luscious aftertaste and finish.  The mouthfeel is about medium bodied with a slightly sticky sort of feel. However, with that in mind, I do feel the alcohol a bit cherishing its return to my tongue.  Overall, what gets me the most with this beer is that though the alcohol is noted in the feel, one can still drink this beer with its respected food.

look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 330ml bottle into the appropriate Duvel Tulip. Paid £2.00 for a single bottle.    Pours a slightly hazy, pale, golden-straw coloured body with masses of intense, fine, streaming carbonation. A huge, four-finger in height, foamy, pure white coloured head with fantastic retention, gradually sinks to a dense cap, leaving clumps of thick, sticky lacing on the glass.     On the nose, delicate, fruity esters of banana, apple, and pear as well as spicy notes of clove and pepper float above a trace of crisp, light malt. Taste follows the nose almost exactly, adding just a touch of lemon rind to the fruity and spicy flavour profile, while in the mid palate, crisp, pilsner-like malts are bolder than the aroma suggested. A gently spicy, grassy and earthy hop bitterness builds towards the finish, joined by a touch of alcohol that adds a little warmth to lingering spices. In the mouth a light body and masses of endless sparkling carbonation give a champagne-like-feel, that’s crisp, dry and refreshing from start to finish.    Overall this is a fantastic beer. Strong and complex but delicate and hugely drinkable, widely available at an excellent price point. My go to Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Recommended.

Large, fast-moving bubbles race throughout the beer, and it's topped with a huge fluffy white head.     Herbal notes of grass and hay pair with lemon zest and yeast to round out the aroma.    Flavor is bursting with complex fruit flavors. Sweet lemon, banana, clove, apples, white grape juice, and too many more to try and separate individually.     The carbonation on this beer is a whirlwind of magnificence. This must be the highest level of carbonation I've ever felt in a beer. Truly refreshing. I can't think of another beer I've had that is quite like this one. And then add in the fact it's 8.5%?!!!? Pure excellence.    *Note: The big white frothy head is a BEAST on this beer. It never leaves the glass, and leaves thick foam-sealed lacings everywhere.

Very complex flavour, apricotty and flowery. And dry, complex. In terms of it's complexity, this is one of the best. Rationally a very good beer...    Definitely very apricotty.    For me, probably the best commercially available beer in the world. I have had this in Australia, England, France, Belgium...they sell it everywhere. Respect. Best cold in my opinion

Poured yeast into the glass to produce a light haze. Some carbonation. Head is immense.    A ton of yeast in both nose and taste. Banana. Spices. Fabulously well balanced bitterness.    Slides down beautifully. Tingle is present from both carbonation and alcohol. For an 8.5% ABV beer there's no hint of syrup however. Dangerously drinkable.    One of my all-time favourites. So gratifying that a beer of this outstanding quality can be produced in quantity and distributed worldwide. Well done the Moortgat family for keeping this business privately owned!

I have had the beer on quite a few prior occasions and have always enjoyed it, but that was before I had much experience with other beers within the category. I still like the beer but I find the taste a bit overpowering and I prefer the subtleties of La Chouffe, Delerium Tremens and La Fin Du Monde (yes I know, it's a Tripel, but what is a Tripel after all, but a Belgian Strong Pale Ale?). Would drink again but would prefer any of the 3 just mentioned.

On the end of your tongue, you sense a very harmonic taste of it, with not so much sourness, which make you wait a second before you swallow it. In your throat gives off a strong malt smell in your nose with a stronger bitterness sensed in your mouth. Very impressive.

Look: pale yellow with a massive foam head, great lacing.    Smell: a smoky lemon/banana that I often get from this style.    Taste: sweetness, banana-esque but more complex, leads the way, with citrus, confectioners sugar, and faint malt following.    Feel: fluffy and just a hint of dryness. Enjoyable.    Overall: a really nice beer. Solid all around. I was probably a little harsh, but I imagine this as Belgium's version of, say, Anchor Steam—a very good beer, but not a world-beater.

Prolonged salty and alcoholic taste near the end. Biscuit malt taste long after drinking.   Feel: fuzzy, somewhat creamy due to the carbonation.     Overall: Good mix of belgian ingredients. Though not a great fan of pilsner, great choice for it's kind. European history class in my mouth.

A barely perceptible sediment at the base of the bottle.	  Smell: Sweet floral and fruity belgian yeast aromas dominate with some mineral quality. Alcohol becomes apparent as it warms.	  Taste: Sweet and tart fruity maltiness with spiciness and floral belgian notes throughout. Finishes with a moderate tingly herbal bitterness.   Feel: Medium-full body with very tingly active carbonation    Overall: I'm not too familiar with this style but having really enjoyed Saisons over the summer I thought this would be another belgian style to try. I came to it with pretty high expectations, and while enjoyable I can't say it lived up to whatever I was thinking... It just seems like a solid belgian ale to me. Plus, it's pretty expensive. Still, it seems to be considered the standard-bearer of the style, so it's hard to recommend against it.

Popping the top I get a smell of some biscuit an sweet tarts. Pours into an Apostol tulip to a very pale cloudy straw color with a massive merange-like head that recedes like molasses in January lacing like a root beer float. On the taste this brew is spritzy on the palate up front with a sweet candy and grape middle followed by a clean slightly clingy finish. A classic among classics.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Appearance: thick 2 to 3 inch white head. Cloudy champagne color. Lots of carbonation.  Smell: apples and pears..oh my  Taste: apple pears and bread  Overall: this is a perfect example for this style. This beer is so well balanced and very easy to drink.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A- This one looks exceptional overall! This has a 3 to 4 finger thick head that is super puffy and cloud like, before eventually settling into a thick, very dense film over the beer! Lacing is simply perfect to be honest, with clumps of thick bubbles clinging to the side of my tulip glass. Carbonation looks to be fine and very lethargic in this relatively clear, super golden colored Belgian Ale!    S- There is a fruity nature about this in the aroma profile that lingers into the apple, pear and banana smells....on top of this, there is a very genuine yeasty biscuit smell that reminds me of fresh bread dough that hasn't been baked yet. Mild peppery spice notes round out the finish....a very well rounded aroma profile that goes between sweet and savory....quite nice and pleasantly unique for a golden Ale in my tastings to date!    T- The flavors are simply superb, following the aromas closely. The fruitiness of the brew really shines, and in particular the pear/apple flavors become much more prominent. The yeasty bread notes also shine through and follows through straight to the finish, which becomes just slightly dry and spiced.....clean on the palate.    M/O- Well I'd never know that this was 8.5% beer...simply delicious! The creamy nature of the carbonation and medium body make this almost dessert like and this needs nothing to accompany it. This sets the bar for golden ales in my opinion and is so highly drinkable....I'm afraid of how quickly this would catch up to one during a session. Highest regards and a full recommendation!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 750ml bottle, best before March, 2017, poured into a Duvel Arne Quinze Arist Series glass.    The beer pours a nice golden color, nice clarity with a large stream of bubbles rising to the top of the glass where a huge, foamy, thick, white head sits, about 3 or 4 fingers high with great retention and lace. The aroma is wonderful, yeasty, lightly fruity, peppery, assertive cereal grains with just a light banana character. The flavors match well, fruity esters coming from that signature yeast character, light banana, pale grains have a touch of breadiness to them with a nice peppercorn zing, mild noble hop bitterness and just a touch of clove. The mouthfeel is nice, very lively, moderate to high carbonation, coats decently well, medium body that is lightly dry at the finish.      Verdict: Definitely a benchmark for a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, nice complexity, balance and it definitely drinks easier than the 8.5% ABV, very refreshing. This is definitely earned it's keep as one of the finest Belgian Ales around, a true classic.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 11.2 fl. oz. Bottle  "Best Before" February 2017 (Printed on the label)  Reviewed on August 6th, 2015  Served in a Tulip Glass    Eyes  Poured a pale yellow body. Cloudy and bubbly. A towering bright white head formed and slowly collapsed, leaving plenty of frothy lace behind.     Nose  Bright notes of apple and pear were followed by thicker notes of banana. A spicy layer of yeast served as a backbone for this brew.    Mouth  Sweet notes of apple and pear instantly collided with sharp notes of hops. Sweeter notes prevailed, almost taking a juicy turn. Clean notes of alcohol flared up, finishing semi/dry. Peppery notes from the yeast lingered in the finish. Incredibly crisp. Medium-bodied. High carbonation.    Notes  One of the best beers I have had the privilege of drinking. One of my highest recommendations.

The appearance was a hazy golden yellow color with a one finger foamy white head that dissipated and left a clingy foaminess glazing around the sides of the glass.   The smell started off with sweet to spicy apples, pears, light bananas and a light amount of Belgian sugars. Some clove lightly embeds itself into the mix of things.  The taste was mainly sweet, light biscuity to bready (semi-yeasty tones) slide through to balance and then has a little kick of the clove in the backseat. There's a sticky sweet aftertaste leading into a semi-dry sweet finish.  The mouthfeel sat about a medium on the body with an okay sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly light and construes a nice sweet apple feel running over my tongue.  Overall, for its entirety, it's a stellar brew and should be on the list of Belgian fans if you haven't had this yet!

Decent carbonation and a yeasty tart flavor that tastes a bit like ripe bananas for a moment then turns bitter from the hops. The taste does a great job of hiding the 8.5% alcohol. All around easy drinking beer that could get you in trouble on a hot day.

Taste is quite complex with white grape, lemon, clove, and earthy herbal notes combining with the yeasty banana apparent in the aroma. The mouth feel was light with tingly carbonation, but something seemed slightly dull about it like when hops die off in an old IPA. I'd like to try it again to see if I just got a bad pour. Overall, this has some really nice qualities but seemed a little stale at times.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3 I'll be honest. I know it's considered the defining beer of the style, but I've just never cared that much for Duvel. It's the light lager of Belgian ales, even down to that lightly sulfury aroma. It's clear and pretty with a billowing head, high carbonation and light body, little flavor but a slightly sweet graininess. An easy drinking 8.5% but so boring. If I'm going to have this much alcohol, I'd prefer to get flavor along with it.

No much past this.  Mouthfeel is light-medium. Can't tell if it's closer to an imperial Pilsner or a full bodied light lager  Overall a simple beer, maybe that's why people enjoy this beer. I need more depth, and flavor this seems to be nice and clean but not too much more than that
