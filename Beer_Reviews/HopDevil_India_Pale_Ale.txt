Very tasty and unusual; not west coast and not New England. More of a brown IPA/Scotch ale profile.

The floral notes are really nice, but they quickly give way into an astringent bitterness that isn't exactly as nice a follow up as some other IPAs I've had. Beyond that, I didn't much care for the oily mouthfeel. Overall, an okay beer. Not one I would buy again.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 From notes 3/6/14: Pours clear medium amber producing 2+ fingers of frothy, off-white, somewhat lasting head that leaves rings and wisps of lace. Aroma is floral and citrus hoppiness with caramel malt tones and hits of dog urine. Taste like the nose is floral and citrus with a hint of tropical fruits, moderately lively spice and backed by sweet caramel malts. The dog urine hint is in the mouth as in the nose. Starts hoppy and slightly sweet, balancing toward bitter hips/sweet malt in the middle, gravitating slowly towards bitter again in the finish but transitioning t o a full bitter hop bite and slightly astringent aftertaste. Just enough malt sweetness here to call this brew moderately balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a little oily and spicy with moderate carbonation. 4 stars.

If Pete's was still around, I bet they would have improved and evolved into this. This pours slightly brown and coppery. Hint of caramel with a perfect balance of hops. Good choice if you are in the mood to have more than a few. I would call this an American Brown IPA. Like it.

Leaving nice lacing. (4)    S:  Caramel and spicy herbal licorice. (3.5)    T:  Nice flat bitterness on a vaguely bready malt middle with some grassy-medicinal bite in the finish.  (3.75)    M:  Mediumish body with bright carbonation and a dry hop-shellac finish. (4.25)    O:  This is a nice "old school" IPA. I don't necessarily like that term, but here we are.  Looks exactly like you'd hope, clear with all right retention. The aroma and flavor are both of spicy, somewhat earthy hop flavors intermingled with bready/caramely malt flavors. It is dry and drinkable with medium bitterness. Whenever I have beers like this these days it is a breath of fresh air. I adore NEIPAs as much as the next guy, but being so swamped with them makes beers like this that much more enjoyable. Nothing too fancy, a straightforward profile, dry and drinkable, bracing and tasty. (4)

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 HopDevil India Pale Ale brewed by Victory Brewing Company with an ABV of 6.70% This American IPA pours out a deep golden amber color with a nice white. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness and a slight sweetness. You also pick up a good amount of earthy grains and malts in the smell as well. So far this brew has the look and smell of most American IPA's on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first get a blast of hop bitterness, then this brew mellows out to a smooth sweetness. There is a lot going on in HopDevil India Pale Ale. The body of this IPA is a solid medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a nice balance to it. It is really hard to pick up on the 6.70% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth. The mouth feel is Bold, Hoppy, Rich, Smooth, Clean and Refreshing. Overall I'm going to give HopDevil India Pale Ale a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown, did a real nice job with this American IPA.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Excellent, delicious IPA. Looks nice, amber color with nice head and some lingering lacing. Smells of citrus hoppiness. Tastes of nice hops, more orange, lemon and grapefruit than floral. Also some sweet malt to balance everything out, as well as mild grain and caramel. Smooth finish, thin mouthfeel with just the right amount of mild carbonation throughout. Very little bitter aftertaste. Very impressive!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Bottle best by 2-7-18. Nonic pint.    A: pours a clear dark orange/copper bordering on Amber with a pretty sudsy 1 finger sandy head. No visible carbonation. Lacing for days.    S: sweet caramel malt and some floral, borderline soapy hop aromas. Kind of like the old school pale ales I love so much.    T: wow, it kind of tastes like the old school pale ales I like so much. Drinking this is a little like going back in a time machine. Slightly sweet, orange/citrus peel arrival; pleasant bready and malty off-dry middle. Finish is slightly bitter and piney. Very pleasant and would pair well with pub grub.    M: heavier side of mid-weight. Moderate carbonation. Slightly slick finish.    O: i like this beer. It is a relic of sorts; a classic and easy-drinking IPA. Not trying to impress you with magical tropical hops, 1000 IBUs, or even a refreshing crispness. Just lightly malty, pleasantly bitter, citrus and pine combo that says IPA. Will drink again next time I want a spin in the wayback machine.

S: Bitter pine and citrus, earthy, slight fruity notes, toasty almost roasty malt, and toffee sweetness.     T: Pine, bitter citrus, grapefruit and lemon, some underlying fruity and floral notes, earthy, backed with a pretty fair amount of toasty almost roasty malt, maybe some hints of dark fruit, and caramel/toffee sweetness.     M: Medium body, moderate carbonation.    O: This one almost ventures into red IPA territory with that big malt back bone. Old school, but still tasty in its own way.

Really easy to drink  F: Victory beers always are incredibly well executed in this regard. Nice carbonation level, really easy to toss back. I bet this beer is more bitter than perceived, although the mouthfeel keeps things rounded out nicely  O: Great IPA, surprised I haven't had it yet. Definitely something worth revisiting.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Format: standard 330mL brown bottle with a reasonably funky label - not taking itself too seriously. Very American, and suggests heavily-hopped, which suits me fine.    Appearance: pours a deep orange-amber with plenty of carbonation visible. A fantastic two fingers of tan head pops up and drops to a rocky finger. Looks good.    Aroma: big notes of pine hops with resin and caramel behind.    Taste: I'm quite surprised at how much caramel there is here, still dominated by those hops though, which stands to reason. Very well-balanced, the caramel really adds something to a heavily hopped beer so you don't risk the potential of hop bitterness overload.    Aftertaste: some hop bitterness with a lingering sweetness.    Mouth feel: medium in body with good carbonation, very easy drinking for a beer so high in ABV.    Overall: a very enjoyable American IPA with a fantastic malt sweetness behind that blends well. Very easy to put away for a higher ABV. AU$95 for a case of 24 x 355mL (2017)

Appearance: Clear, bright copper brown with a billowing head of off white foam that leaves terrific streaks of sticky lace.    Smell: Malty, toasty aroma with some caramel sweetness and slightly dank, light citrus hops.    Taste: Pleasantly round, malty base of toasted grains and sweet caramel barely balances the bright and earthy hops: lemon peel, pine needles and black tea leaves. Finishes with a spicy bitterness and just a bit of residual sweetness.    Mouthfeel: Medium body and moderate carbonation with a creamy smooth feel.    Overall: Terrifically balanced IPA, with toasty malt and spicy, bitter hops. Older East Coast style, but still so drinkable and enjoyable.

Taste follows the knows well with a hit of bitterness up front with some pine and citrus that is immediately followed by a fairly strong malt backbone. mouthfeel was sort of thin but it was what I expected. Overall a very good entry level ipa that won't scare off people who think ipas are all totally bitter and undrinkable. very well crafted

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Pours a transparent copper color with a thick foam - not much lacing. Smell is faint on the hops as compared to other beers of the same style. Taste is certainly reminiscent of your east coast or new england IPAs. Much heavier on the malt but the balance is clear in this one as the finish is very smooth. A decent IPA especially for the price - but there are better choices for the style.   
look: 4 | smell: 1.25 | taste: 2 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.75 I had this in cruddy bar, so I hope the negativity is product of poor taps. Looked great, smelled awful. Had two and smell was same. Ruined taste, most likely. Again, review could be skewed due to poor taps   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Dark hazy orange amber colered beer with a frothy bone colored head of about on finger.    Smells of pine and some sweet citrus. Just a touch of dankness. Some breadiness here as well.    Taste follows the nose with that sweet citrus and pine type of bitter. The bitterness on the taste is far from overwhelming. The bitter seems to come towards the back of the taste.    Mouth feel to me was a surprisingly lighter feel than some IPA varities. There is a bit of an oily finish and some resin coating the lips.    Overall I like this IPA and glad I gave it a shot. When I poured the last of my can into my glass I got a shit ton of sediment. I already have some favorite IPA's and do not feel as if I would bump one from my list for this IPA. That said it is a well done IPA and may be the one that gets your motor started. I reccomend this for any fan of the style.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Poured from a can with a best by date of Nov. 20, 2017. The beer pours a deep, clear amber color. There is a thick off-white head with thick lacing.    The smell explodes with citrus hops but there is also a strong malt backbone.    The taste is deep, bitter pine hops with a decent malt backbone. There is not a lot of citrus that comes through in the taste, just tons of bitter, floral hops.    The mouthfeel is thick with medium carbonation.    Overall this is good but a bit more floral hops than I expected from the smell.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.75 L: Clear amber with a tight beige head. Moderate retention, with some splotchy lacing.    S: Super sweet toasty malt, tons of caramel and toffee and toasted brown bread. There's a little bit of grapefruit juice and woody, pine as well, but it's mostly tons of malt.    T: Caramel, toffee, and toasted bread throughout. There is a little bit of grapefruit juice and grapefruit in the mid-palate, but overall this is cloying. There's some earthy and piney bitterness near the finish, but that cloying caramel malt just sticks hard.    F: Medium-bodied, medium-carbonated, very sticky with all the residuals sugars.    O: Not my cup of tea. This is bad IPA, in my honest opinion. Victory makes a ton of great beer and I love most of it, but this is not one of them.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 It pours a translucent amber gold body with a head that disappears within a couple seconds. Even with an aggressive pour, the head didn’t last. Some light lace ran here and there. The smell has an earthy hoppiness that isn’t overbearing. I noticed a bit of clove and cinnamon. The taste has the earthy hoppiness again along with the clove and cinnamon. The palate has a low to medium amount of carbonation. Between light and medium bodied. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, a pretty good IPA that I would come back to.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Had Dirt Wolf earlier from Victory so I knew I had to try their other staple IPA. A very nice and nostalgic experience indeed - athough they are from Pennsylvania, this beer reminds me some of the great craft IPAs that have been recently made in Hungary - though just a mere coincide.  Looks also follow this, I noticed that Hungarian IPAs tend to be filtered sharp and clear with a golden brownish, caramellized malty hue. Although on the hoppy side they are unbeatable: this Hop Devil is full of Citra, and it has been shamelessly dry hopped with it as well.  The more I drink it the more it reminds me of the good old IPAs of Hungary, East Coast style from East Europe. Good to know that we had such an example to aim for.  It is quite different from your "average" American IPAs, in a good way. Although for me personally it might not be something shockingly brand new, I am glad for this one. Very well done, and the hopping puts the icing on the cake (or on the beer).

The flavor is much the same, dominated by resinous flavors of pine and cannabis, and highlighted by bitter grapefruit peel. The bitterness is nice and high, and well contrasted by malt. The mouthfeel is full, rich, and sticky. Overall this is a true classic IPA, with sticky, rich, piney flavors.

An excellent IPA.

Some pine in the front with pretty solid carbonation     Overall a very solid beer, it is very easy to drink and does not bash you on the head with lots of bitterness, something that is often overdone in this style. Would gladly drink again.

I've always been a fan of the devil du hops artwork.    L: Clear copper/caramel pour. Thin off-white head. Spotty lacing.    S: Rich and biscuity grains... pungent pine, grapefruit, and herbal hops.     T/F: Follows the nose. Caramel malts and grains which lead to a big bitter hop profile. Grapefruit and pepper... resinous pine, and a bit herbal. Very assertive... reminds me of baking. Medium body and solid carbonation. Finish is spice and pepper which lingers on the palate.    O: One of my first favorite IPA's, and just as good now with a belated re-visit. I tend to hit Dirtwolf more frequently but you can't go wrong by hitting up the classics. This was the beer that made sitting at Phillies games a joy.

Taste: Notes of citrus and pine are present but I wish there was more. Sweet malty finish along with some bready notes. Definitely not the hop devil as the label indicates.    Feel: Medium bodied.    Overall: Very solid IPA from Victory. Wish this had a bit less sweetness and malt and more hops so this could be the devil as the label indicates. I would definitely pick this up again though and consume.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 Is it unfair I ultimately knock this for untruth in advertising? Because I do. To me, "hop devil" says blast you in the damn face with hops, and this does not. Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass.     Looks beautiful. Amber red, full head. Nice lacing as I drink it.    Smells of malt, and in fact a nice sophisticated malt smell, light hops, there's some biscuit in there but what do I know, I have slight cold.    As a dedicated hop head, here is my beef: to me the malt is much stronger than the hop. Now, that's wonderful if you don't call your beer HOP DEVIL. It's a very light hop and citrus balanced with the malt. Call it something else and I would be raving about it. Twenty years ago and I would be raving about it. But today you kind of expect something else when promised the Lord of Darkness Himself of hops. That's why I have to knock down the overall score, it is not what is promised, although it is very good as a beer in and of itself.     Feel is about right. It's lightly carbonated, slight oil and dryness on the finish. I could drink six of these. Refreshing.     Again, I temper this review with my thoughts on the name. I don't think that is unfair. A real hop head will not be getting what they think they are with a name like that. But this is a damn fine beer, very balanced, very drinkable, very satisfying. I would drink this again, and I would drink a six pack of this. Just know what you are getting and you will pleased: a very balanced almost malt heavy AIPA.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Look- Dark golden to amber with a light tan head  Smell- Hops and citrus with a nice malt and wheat complement  Taste- Complex. Hops are balanced out with a sweet malty finish.  Feel- Light-Medium bodied despite color and malty finish.  Overall- Fantastic beer. The hoppy citrus flavor is balanced out by a sweet malty finish. Definitely worth a try and could be a go to brew.

It's still good though.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 Malty aroma with some apricottyness coming through also...    Complex taste with multiple layers...an initial malty bitterness followed by a more fruity orange peel and apricotty bitterness.    Very good overall balance, works well

It's got the citrus but there is a more malty smell mixed in here. Not the bitter devil you might think, the taste has some citrus with a nice malt balance with some very slight bitterness. Feel is quite carbonated with a wet lingering citrus/malt taste.

As I drink this sassy IPA once again, this beer reminds me of... believe it or not, a chihuahua.     This beer has the label, promise, and attitude of a dangerous bite of hops. Although this is not a nuclear explosion of hops as expected, this is a phenomenal IPA.    An attractive amber, ever so slightly cloudy/red pour, a minimally discolored pretty head rests at one inch or less.    This beer has a respectable citrus kick that immediately floods the mouth. You feel the intensity that tries to breath through. It's not quite the devil that it proclaims, but still a taste that leaves you smacking your lips and reathing through the mouth to enjoy the strong hop accents that try to punch through this bold, summery (and dare I say..playful?) IPA.    It has the attitude and initial punch of a triple IPA, but quickly forgives with citrus and summer character. One of my favorites.

Very very drinkable.

The head is less than 1/3". The aroma doesn't pop. Seems like a lager bill hopping.     A good amount of toffee/caramel like malt impressions. The hops just aren't cutting it though given the label and beer name. If you wanna go malty, this might be up your alley.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass:    Appearance: dark copper, with a slightly reddish tint in different lights. Pours a plenty thick head, with an off white color to it. Lots and lots of sticky lacing while drinking. The body is mostly translucent; maybe a touch of haze to it.    Aroma: kind of disappointing....some bitter hops, some malty sweet notes, maybe a smidgeon of citrus underneath. Definitely more of a "classic" IPA in its scent.    Taste: thankfully, this beer hasn't aged badly at all despite not being en vogue at the moment. Packs tons of hop complexity and is perfectly balanced and delicious. Begins lightly sweet, with some nice citrusy and dank notes, and finishes piny and bitter. Moderate malt backbone doesn't overwhelm or over-sweeten the beer.    Feel: silky smooth and full-bodied for a less than 7% IPA, this drinks super nice.    Overall: everyone reminisces about how this was their go-to before the recent hop haze and juice revolution, but this beer is still fantastic.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 For years, this was my go-to beer. Remember being blown away by the hops when I first tried it at Bob and Barbara's in Philly around year 2000. Today, it's not all that outrageous, but you've got to respect your elders and appreciate the classics.    Pours a nice copper color with an off-white head that leaves decent lacing. What I get in the aroma these days is actually a wallop of malty sweetness, but there's fairly grapefruit-ish, earthy hops in there, too. These hops continue to the taste, with a strong malt balance, that's somewhat nutty in character. Medium to heavy bodied for an IPA.    What can I say? The newcomers have surpassed it in the decades that have followed, but this is still a damn good beer. Thank you, Victory.

When I tried it, really bad compared to west coast hoppy IPAs. Maybe fresher it's better, but due to my location, why is a west coast IPA fresher than a Philly IPA?

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 A: Beautiful copper-amber with a tinge of ruby. Crystal clear and with medium carbonation. I didn't pour with quite as much gusto as usual since I was using a different glass from normal, but I got a finger of dense, creamy off-white head. Great head retention, I poured this baby up, let it sit for about ten minutes and it still had a thick film of foam across the top. Wonderful lacing, it just won't stop clinging to the sides of the glass.     S: Very good caramel creates the backbone of the scent profile. Sweet and malty like a good IPA should smell. Really 50/50 on the malt/hops ratio. I also detect spicy notes and some slight (emphasis on slight) estery scents, like banana. Some grainy notes come through but remind of fresh whole grain bread. Hops aren't huge on the nose, but don't really need to be. I get some resinous, deep notes, and as a whole it definitely edges on piney and general "dank" earthy tones, but there is a tinge of lemongrass.     T: Counterintuitive to what I expected on the smell, the hops are forward here. Malt does a great job of supporting and balancing the bitter and deep green hops. At first, the resinous, earthy flavors are very pronounced, but don't overstay their welcome. Medium bitterness overall. Malt is subtle, but I do get definite caramel and a little bit of a brown sugar flavor. Again, reminds me of fresh baked artisan bread. As the beer warms, the spicy, fruity flavors come out to play. Pepper tingles on the tongue toward the end of the taste experience.    F: It tastes like a DIPA but doesn't feel like one. Medium bodied overall, not something that I could pound down but it's crisp like any good IPA should be. Doesn't finish remarkably clean, but it has some astringency from the slightly higher alcohol content which helps give it a slightly dry bite after the swallow.     Overall: Easily one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of reviewing. Balanced, complex without going crazy, and overall a joy to savor. I don't have much else to say about this, I've already written an article.     To good health and good beer.

Taste: Big hops, a teeny-weeny bit of bread/crackers, but no complexity.  Mouthfeel: some lingering bitterness in a nice way.    Overall: This is one of Victory's beers that got them attention and it's a lovely introduction to their line of hoppy beers. I hope they continue to make it for the next 30 years!

Has that typical hoppy smell of an IPA. Initial taste is pleasant but gradually finishes quite bitter. If you like IPA's, this one's for you.

Still, there's a definite punch of awesome hop bitterness in the finish with grassy, pine hops blending with the sweet syrupy malt flavors.     F- Very smooth, medium body without too much carbonation.    O- Excellent West Coast IPA, a classic for sure.

The sweet, caramel malt balances it out and the floral hops add some spice. 4.5  F: Medium body and agressive bitterness give a big feel to this hoppy, malty ale. 4.5  O: It's so good even 20 years after I first had it. Balanced yet both the hops and malts get a chance to speak. This should always be in my house. This beer didn't stop being awesome because there are lots of hoppier beers available now ;) 4.5    Enjoy by: 7/2/2016

T = Lighter than I thought it should be for an IPA. Not as much piney-ness as I would have expected.  F = Again, lighter here than I thought, but is still refreshing.  O = I actually really like this one because it's not as much like an IPA as the other I have tried. This one was considerably more mellow than others, which I liked, but it didn't seem as much an American IPA as it should be.

Fabulous piney nose that gives you a hint of what's to come. Fabulous hops with just enough malt to give it a hint of balance. I first had this beer at the Philly airport and after that I visited the Victory taproom any time I came to town. This was the IPA that hooked me on IPA's and made me a hop head; and for that I thank you.

S: Floral hops and wild grass, some earthy notes, also quite a bit of caramel malt. The aroma on this one isn't nearly as strong as some other IPAs.    T: Starts out with a very strong bitterness, followed by floral hops, some pine and then ends with a lot of sweet malt. Kinda odd how the beer goes from very bitter to quite sweet by the finish, quite interesting.    F: Medium body, nice and creamy carbonation a pretty easy drinking IPA.    O: A very malty yet bitter at the same time IPA, which isn't bad but doesn't blow my socks off.

NBS BIF#3  Rich amber hued liquid pushes up a meaty buttermilk biscuit colored head 2 fingers-plus high. Slowly recedes to an afterthought. Smell hints at a little malt sweetness after a wash of piney, grassy hops that move to citrus. Taste is more of the same with a finish that lingers with the piney notes. A good old school IPA. Mouthfeel is full enough for my taste. Overall, a very good IPA.

Chilled to 39 degrees, allowed to sit for 5-10 minutes before opening, poured into a large wine glass.    Look: Pours a nice orange/red amber color with a 1inch tan colored head. Noticeable carbonation held the head up longer than some other beers and continued until the end. When head finally dissipated it left a light foam coating with some lacing. Very promising visuals.    Smell: Hard to determine, some floral/grassy notes, bit of spice, hint of pine.    Taste: Hops and malt seem to be balanced at the start, lightly resinous, grassy but not totally unpleasant aftertaste.    Mouthfeel: Medium body, carbonation is noticeable throughout.    Overall: Drinkable but unimpressive. Cool looking label seemed to promise more than I got. It really held it's carbonation well, always a plus. Not a bad beer by any measure and would certainly like to try this again. Curious to know if draft would be different from bottled.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Good example of a beer with lots of hop flavor but that doesn't overwhelm the drinker with bitterness. It's rich copper in color and with a thick, fluffy off white head. Smells grassy, citrusy (grapefruit and lemon), piney, and with some bready sweetness. Taste has lots of different hop flavors, starts fairly sweet on the palate, and finishes very dry. Feel is medium as far as thickness and carbonation, and leaves a resiny coating on the tongue. There's obviously a lot of different styles of hops going on here (I'm not seasoned enough to pick out which flavor is which) but there's enough balanced sweetness to keep it from being a palate wrecker.

Not that much foam, but fine pored. Smell of honey, pines, more like forest-honey, very sweet on the nose.  The start is really bitter, didn't expect that, but then also malty and sweet. Little bit of mango; Very smooth and crisp, but I miss the fruit notes and the balance of the body. The only Thing thats special here is that the start is really bitter and the aftertaste is not bitter at all, more sweet...

Amber golden once the waterfall of a nitro pour subsided.    Nose had a surprising light citrus note to it. Wasn't too strong, but was there. Generic vegetal notes otherwise. I'll blame the nitro.    Generally avoid IPAs on nitro, but was in an adventurous mood. This came across as a lightly caramel honey malt opening backed by the hops from the nose, but more bitter than the nose indicated. This was not a bitter pour, but the hops played nicely and did win the battle by the end.    Feel was what would be expected from a nitro pour, smooth with any harshness muted.    Actually a better experience that I was thinking I'd have originally. Definitely need to revisit this with a fresh regular bottle of this beer.

Smells of strong citrus hops, strong floral hops, slight resin, sweet malt, alcohol, and a hint of caramel malt. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong citrus hops, strong floral hops, alcohol, sweet malt, hint of yeast, hint of resin, and a hint of caramel malt. Overall, strong body and aroma, good blend and appearance.

Appearance: It poured a clear copper orange colour with an off white one finger head that dissipated quickly but left nice stringy lacing.    Aroma: Citrus orange and lemon, pine with hints of tropical fruits and light caramel malt.    Taste: Grapefruit and pine bitterness with quite a strong malt sweetness backbone. The finish is a nice lingering bitterness.    Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with medium carbonation.    Overall: A nice IPA with good bitterness but maybe slightly too much malt sweetness.

There were some gems in the box, but Hop Devil was my favorite (though I am biased towards IPAs). Great value for such a well executed IPA. Highly recommended.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Victory brewing is quite a nice brewery. This Hop Devil I have seen many times on the shelf, but the label is a bit cartoonish and so it took me awhile to finally give it a try. This one is 6.7% ABV.    Look-It pours a beautiful dark copper amber that glints with hues of red in the sun. The lacing is sparse lending to the thin head that settles quickly.    Smell-It smells of malty breads, molasses, oak, and a bit of sweetness. The hops aren’t as noticeable as the malts. It is a bit fruity and very malty. A bit of worry overcomes me.    Taste-The worry fades away as I taste a medium to full bodied hoppy brew with excellent flavors of pine, grassy hops, caramel, some fruits, and some mild citrus. The malts can really be described as dark breads and oaky deliciousness, but the hops do come through nicely on the palate.     Mouthfeel-It is, as I’ve said, medium to full bodied and has an oily hoppy finish. Nice lingering on the tongue that captures its hop essence.    Overall-It is a really nice beer. This IPA is going to sipped on again by myself in the future. Cheers!

On the nose, it has a spicy citrus character. The hops were definitely immediately apparent. I found that the palate had a very pleasant hoppy character without being too bitter. However, the finish had a somewhat bready, malty character that made me think this bottle might have been a tad stale. The feel was very pleasant--a nice, crisp bite with no apparent flaws.    Overall this was a very pleasant beer and remains a staple of my everyday-drinking IPA lineup.

The appearance was a clear deep amber, with a one finger white foamy head that died off within less than a half a minute. Light messy lacing slides into the beer.  The smell had some bright citrus and piney notes over some light spice and then the caramel malt.  The taste was moderately the same with a sweetness coming from the malt and the hops. There's a soft bittersweet aftertaste leading into the finish.  The mouthfeel was about light bodied with a sly herbal quality lending a hand to a nice smoothness not normally associated with AIPA's, but hey, here comes the bitterness and it hits my tongue nicely.  Overall, this was a pretty nice AIPA. I heard before I was into beer that this was a top 10 beer of the world at one time, well this noob hopefully will get more of this to drink to all of the beer veterans who have gone before me and gave it the more than solid marks it deserves.

Smell is dominated by caramel malt, with citrus hops coming in second- not really enjoyable. Flavor is more toffee than hops, although some pine does show through on the finish and brings some good bitterness with it. Feel is wonderful- fluffy and ethereal, even without the head present. Definitely the high point.  Surprised by this beer, in a bad way. Unbalanced in the completely wrong direction. This was not the freshest sample, but it was well within the brewer's best-by date, ergo, I expect more hops. I marked down extra for not being even close to style guidelines; it was still an enjoyable brew. It has the look and feel of a world-class IPA, just the olfaction and taste sorely disappointed.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Serving: On tap into a pint glass  Served: August 2016    This review really fell through the cracks, but thankfully I had it at my friend's wedding so it was a memorable time.    Appearance: The bar I was at was pretty dark, so it's difficult to provide a good review of the color, but the beer appeared clear and deep amber, with a soft head that collapsed under the ABV after a reasonable time but not too fast. Looks like a solid IPA.    Smell: Bright citrus and pine hoppiness. Very little malt presence in the nose at all.    Taste: Pleasently 'juicy' but also maintains a pleasant bitterness on the very back end, drying out the palate and prompting another sip. Hop flavors are predominantly citrus, though I also tasted solid assertions of pine and a soft note of herbalness. Medium malt body carries the beer nicely, without getting cloying or thin.    Mouthfeel: Medium to medium-high body. Medium carbonation. Very drinkable without feeling thin or heavy. Really great for an IPA.    Overall: A fantastic IPA, no doubt, and one that I think should definitely be talked about more! Another great beer from Victory.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Lovely, clear amber but not much head. Smell bready, pepper, mango and a bit of banana. When I first poured this IPA, it was more malty and on the sweet side but as it warmed it opened up and the complexity and balance came through -- a bit of pine, citrus, ever so slight bitter at the end. Mouth feel pretty perfect. Don't drink over-chilled. Will have a again.

The unexpected thing about the taste is that I detect some ground coffee. I had this in a blind tasting and I was convinced it was Stone Mocha IPA. Nobody else seems to think there's any resemblance between these two, or that there are any coffee notes in this beer.

The warm, rich, malty flavor coats and warms your entire mouth as it passes through. There is a bitterness in the after taste that increases as you exhale and let outside air in. I definitely enjoyed this IPA and would recommend it to those that are considering trying a new one. I would buy again for sure.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Let me preface my remarks by saying that I am a students of brews rather than an expert, and that despite all the hype, IPA is not my favorite style. I liked this IPA more than most I've tried--definitely more than Stone IPA. The color is a pleasing amber. The smell is pepper and spice, and reminded me a bit of a Bloody Mary. No smell of fruit that I could detect. The beer was pleasingly bubbly on the tongue. The taste began as malty and mildly sweet, without much citrus taste that I could detect. The finish was mildly bitter and spicy. However, the aftertaste was very bitter, and lingered long on the tongue. If Stone is a "bitter bomb," and Sculpin and Bell are "citrus bombs," then this is somewhere in between: not perhaps rising to the level of a "spice bomb," but close. I have a feeling that I'll be coming back to this one.    EDIT: Sometimes the malt smell is more prominent, although whether this is from the batch or the glass, I don't know. Also, the bitterness does not last as long sometimes. In any case, I've decided that this is my favorite IPA, even though it does not conform to the current ideal of the "Hop bomb." It reminds me of an ESB in its maltiness, an IPA in its bitterness, and a lager in its drinkability.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This was the first IPA I ever had, way back in 2004, and, if I remember correctly, was the first real craft beer I tasted. Obviously I'm a bit biased, but this is an American IPA classic. Poured a bottle into my new nonic pint glass. Beautiful deep amber color with a smaller head that dissipates quickly and doesn't leave much lacing. Aroma is full or toasted malt and various earthy notes, which is exactly what you get from the taste as well; great, balanced earthy and malty hops. Really nice mouthfeel, perfect carbonation, very smooth.     What a throwback, I would enjoy this any time! Can't wait to have it on draft again.

I loved it so much that I had the Sikkens paint company (manufacturer of Mercedes paint) color match it with their spectrophotometer device to perfectly match a gallon of paint for my bike. The best.

look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Serving type: 12 oz bottle into a shaker pint    Pours a clear honey amber color. Smell is of dry hops, slight smokiness, with some earth scents. The earthiness isn't my favorite. The taste reflects the smell much better. Great hops punch, followed by smoky and earthy flavors. The earthy flavors work much better in the taste than the smell. The body is medium light with ample carbonation that leads to a semi dry finish. Overall, this is a nice IPA with great hops and smoky attributes that work much better in the taste than the aroma. Would definitely have again paired with BBQ.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Appearance: dark amber/orange with a very thin somewhat soapy head that doesn't persist    Smell: slight hints of molasses and toasted malt lead into piney earth notes    Taste: surprisingly yeasty and malty with a constant underlying pine hoppiness. After sipping there is a definite toasty note lingering on the tongue. Id be interested in seeing the grist bill for this brew. Not going to lie the taste threw me off a bit. It had the malty richness or a trippel but the bitterness and refreshing hints of a very hoppy IPA. Not unenjoyable, just unexpected.     Overall: An IPA to break the mold. Hoppy and complex. I can see why people love this brew but to be honest it wasn't my favorite. It has a certain heaviness in the flavor that I think appeals to many and almost feels like a "winter ipa" if you would. Still would drink again though   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Amber colored with little head. Aroma leans more towards the earthy and grassy. Taste I'd floral, dank definitely an old school ipa. Not in your face with bitterness or grapefruit. I like it a more malt forward ipa.

Normally my reviews are longer, more detailed, and define each and every part of it. But all I'm going to say is this: It's hoppy, flavorful, and yet easygoing enough to please the masses. It's a phenomenal staple beer, and should stand the test of time as Victory's best, and as the perfect drink to transition a normal beer-drinker into a hop-head. It's not the greatest, but like I said, it's a drink to remember.     Enjoy.    Drink if you want a great, hoppy pale ale.

Not picking up much citrus here, this is more on the pine than citrus side. Taste is somewhat dank. It is good, but not really what I like in an IPA. Feel, this puppy taste thick. Has a real nice mouthfeel, but a little on the sweet side. Nice IPA, would get it again on tap

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 The body is a very deep Amber, bordering on red, that is top with a lasting white head. The nose is sweet and malty for an IPA, but the hops are prevalent and nicely balances. A strong sweet malt flavor dominates from the start with a toasted sensation, but the key is that hop flavors are playing along the whole time. The complexity of this is wonderful. This beer has been around for a while and should not be overlooked in the way of the hop bombs of today.

Good for an IPA...mild hoppiness and only a mild headache afterwards - I'll call that a success. Definitely not "devilish". Enjoyed while watching Peaky Blinders on Netflix.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 L -- Pours copper with a small off-white head that quickly fizzles out. No lacing on this pour.     S -- Immediate, bold grapefruit scent, along with a minute lemon zest ending, right after pouring. Develops into a more balanced hop aroma with resin joining the fray. There's a minor sweetness to it as well that adds complexity to the hops.     T -- Flavor very much follows the aroma: grapefruit, pine, with a strong bitterness to go along with it. The end notes are very much resiny, but the sweetness from the aroma melds with it to lessen the overall bitter-blow. The malts add a bready component, sorta like a tasty honey-nut flavored loaf, plus some minor caramel notes.     F -- Medium body, crisp, refreshing: very drinkable. I'll actually call it full-bodied for an IPA as the more I drink it, the "richer" it starts to feel in my life. It leaves a fairly dry palate and the bitterness leaves a light zing on the tongue.     O -- A very good beer. It's a great east coast IPA example, with plenty of hops and a solid malt backbone to go with it. I'd be happy to have this in the fridge all the time.

Would not describe as a "heavy hitting" IPA but has a alcohol presence. If you like malt-forward IPAs I would recommend. Wish I could have had this from a tap fresh!

Aroma of pine, grapefruit, caramel and sweet malt. Medium bitterness, light sweetness and a hint of saltiness. Noticeable alcohol. Light to medium body; thin, slightly sticky texture; average carbonation; noticeable malt backbone and a long, slightly dry, pine bitterness in the finish.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 Hop Devil by Victory Brewing.    Never had one outta these guys. Let us hope it works out in my favor.    Look - Pours clear amber with a two finger slightly off white head that sticks around like a good father. The carbonation is on low with this one. No cloud formations to speak of. Yet at least. Leaves good lacing. 4.     Smell - Dominated by the malts and a half grapefruit mix. There really isn't a whole lot to say here. Half and half wins this race. 3.25.    Taste - The grapefruit pith is most prevelant really. The malts are certainly there but it is absolutely nothing to write home about. Basic IPA. 3.25.    Feel - Medium carbonation with a slighty watery body. Only thing saving this aspect is the creaminess. 3.    Overall - Blah. Generic as can be, nothing new here. Uninpressive, even for the style. I'd pass in the future. 3.

Apparently though, not as pleased as others, but I still enjoyed this offering.    I had it as a draft - great golden brown coloration with a weak head but strong lacing down the glass - quite impressive really. I noted some citrusy scents that mixed well with the strong hoppy aroma. The brew was well carbonated (more so than to my liking) and the aftertaste was a big surprise to me, since lately I've had some strong IPAs and haven't had the aftertaste I experienced with this beer. I didn't note the citrusy odor in the beer itself, which I expected, but IPA was definitely bold in flavor. Overall, it was a very good beer and would definitely partake from it again.

Not quite as good as langunitas ipas though.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 12oz bottle. Code date of 8/9/15. Appearance: Deep amber and clear with a light khaki head. Aroma: relatively faint hop aroma for an American IPA. Some floral and herbal notes, but it’s minimal. Caramel malt also noticeable. Taste: Rich caramel and toasty malt flavors dominate, with a sharp hop bitterness that has some herbal and resinous notes. Mouthfeel: Medium body with some viscosity and low carbonation. Finish: Some lingering herbal bitterness and caramel malt. Overall: Definitely an east coast as opposed to west coast IPA. More malt balanced than a west coast IPA. Drinks like a slightly hoppier American Amber   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 First of all, wow!    A deep Amber copper color. Creamy off white head that never fully dissipates. Beautiful lacing.    The smell was good, but it didn't prepare me for the taste. The smell was underwhelming. The taste was certainly not.    Very hoppy. Finishes very sharp. A little salty, even.     Feels almost creamy, but not heavy. My favorite aspect of the beer.    Overall, a beautiful beer. If you like IPAs, give it a try. If you don't like IPAs, save your money because it's truly an IPA.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 I have been wanting to try this beer for a long time. In Philadelphia on business and finally got my chance. Beautiful hazy orange color with thin white head. One of the best aromas of any IPA I've ever had. Bold, floral exotic taste with lots of things going in the finish. Absolutely amazing. In my top ten.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Decent IPA from Victory. Floral, spice, dank bitterness that lingers on the palate. Prefer Dirtwolf anyday however. Not a bad offering though. Always available in my area which is nice.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Maybe it's just me but I found this beer to be way too malty and boring. The thing was I could tell this was going to be the case from the aromas alone . . . and this bottle still has 4 months until it's best by date. The appearance is nice enough. It glows and even looks attractive and inviting in the glass. But the taste and flavors are far from being a good ipa.

I decided to give it a second chance and was surprised by the how much better it tasted this time around. Hoppy, piny, citrus deliciousness. Reminded me of Great Divide's Titan IPA but a bit sweeter and not quite as hoppy. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and can see where the hype is coming from. I believe batches vary in quality but if you get a good one your in for a treat.

Poured out of a bottle a nice amberish color with little head. Smell was floral with apricot, slight banana, and pine. Taste was a blast of hops! It dissipates giving way to a citrus and apricot hint and finishing with just a hint of pine. The hoppy taste lingers for a bit after the finish. A must try for hop heads!

This is followed by a nice biscuity malt aroma with a hint of alcohol.  Incredibly hoppy taste, bitter, piny and resiny. The malt presence is slightly felt in the background. Dry, hoppy, bitter and resin like finish that leaves a lingering aftertaste. Full mouthfeel. Creamy and smooth.

S: Pine, orange, malts, zest.     T: Slightly sour apples, hint of charcoal, fruity but initially it didn’t have vast amounts of bitterness. Finished with a hit of wheat and eventually there was some bitterness which lingered, the malt to IBU balance was slightly on favour of the malt.     M: Light to medium body, not too much carbonation.     O: Good but not memorable, would get buried under the all the good east coast IPAs.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Poured into a Dogfish Head IPA glass.    A - 4.25 - Pours a nice caramel orange color. Forms about a finger of lightly yellowed white head. Medium head potential and retention. Spotty lacing.   S - 3.5 - Nothing too wild here. VERY light hop aroma, a touch of spice and a strong herbal note.  T - 3.25 - A little on the weak side for me. Very lightly sweet arrival which quickly fades into a quite weak bitter hop ending.   F - 4 - Good smooth and decently oily mouthfeel.  O - 3.5 - This is what I call a food pairing beer and a shower beer. This would make a fine transitional brew for beginners, but experienced IPA drinkers may find this a bit weak due to its lack of bitterness and other flavors. A decent little session IPA, but nothing to write home about.

I'm not a big fan of the style personally, so I'm already biased against it, but I find this one lacks the sour milk aftertaste that ruins most IPAs for me. This has a strong, crisp, grapefruity bitterness balanced with a nice malty sweetness. It is like Victory's Prima Pils but with a much more intense hoppy bitterness. I don't know if I'd go out of my way to buy this number again, but I do like it.

Big hops in your nose and rolling across your tongue, but a nice malty backbone to support it. It's closing in on 20 years since I drank my first bottle of Hop Devil and crowned it the best India Pale Ale I'd ever had, and it remains one of my favorite IPAs still today.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Lovely deep copper in color, brilliantly clear. Pours a nice tight white head with good retention.    Nice slightly sweet hoppy aroma with a bit of mango and pine. Hop aroma a bit subdued, but may be sampling this beer at too cold of a temperature.    Nice maltiness up front is immediately balanced by a lovely nutty hop flavor. Hop flavors more pine than fruit, and has a nice bitterness all the way through. No harsh bitterness break on the back end. Bitterness and overall hop flavors are well done.    Medium body and carbonation, no astringency or harshness from the hops. Maybe a very slight alcohol warming.     Super drinkable for a hoppy IPA. Not overpowering despite being intensely hoppy and quite bitter. Sufficient malt from which to hang the hops. I suddenly have a new contender for my favorite American IPA.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a nonic pint glass. Beautiful clear copper color w/a finger width of creamy pillowy head which diminished but lasted to the last drop and left some nice lacing on glass. Very piney aroma. Grapefruit at start and finish. Leans to the hop side on taste but still has good malt balance. Carbonation just right. Excellent IPA.

From the second I opened the bottle you could smell the pine. A very hop forward smell.  Very balanced taste that left just a slight aftertaste.   Could drink this beer all day as it is very tasty. In my mind this is a perfect IPA.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours a cloudy, copper with a nice soapy head. Minimal, fine lacing. The head eventually settles into a nice, tan foam on top.    Smells surprisingly malty for an IPA; lots of fruit and brown bread notes before the hops kick in. It tastes even maltier, which is nice albeit a bit shocking from a beer called "Hop Devil." Lots of raisin and brown bread notes on the tongue with floral hops up front and resiny, bitter hops at the end, punctuating the heavy sweetness of the malt.    It feels somewhat heavy for this style; it's a smooth, medium brew, but with a somewhat aggressive carbonation to even it out. It works well here. But, to be sure, it's a heavier feel for an IPA.    Overall, this is an unusual IPA with the heavy malt presence and feel, but still refreshing and different. I was tempted to rate this lower, but I really like the originality here! I will get this again. I can see this going well with a nice beef or lamb roast.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A - Clear orange with a nice thick head.   S - Piney, malty with a little citrus.  T - Taste follows the nose with maybe a little orange.   M - Medium mouth feel and medium carbonation.  O - Very drinkable beer. Not over the top like some West Coast IPA's. Very solid, I can see why this is the go-to IPA for some drinkers.

Smell: piney and citrus hops    Taste: Fairly traditional American IPA palate with strong caramelly malt sweetness that nearly balances the strong piney lemon tangerine hops. Lingering bitterness on the tongue.    Feel: Light to medium body and smooth mouthfeel.     Overall: A well-crafted traditional IPA. However, the sweetness approaches excessive for my taste, and the hops while good are nothing to rave about. Although it would have stood out on the shelves 10 or 15 years ago, there are enough interesting alternatives out there now that I don't see myself returning to the Hop Devil.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Nice orange color. Pale head, off-white/tan. Beer looks filtered.    Very nice bouquet of apricots, orange, peach.    Mouthfeel has some nice richness.    Flavor is solid, foursquare. Hops, mostly. Hint of peaches.     Deep but not intense bitter notes on the finish. Almost cocoa, but not a hint of sweetness.
