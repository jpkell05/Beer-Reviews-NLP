look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 12 Oz bottle poured into glass  Look - very dark almost black as expected. Medium foam head slowly fades, some excellent glass lacing  Smell - Mocha, lots of chocolate and coffee. A bit of caramel and grain.  Taste - Very bitter chocolate and hops. Creamy coffee and oats. Slight metallic flavor like cherries. It has a full profile, I personally don't think it goes down easy because it is filling. Carbonation is medium. A bit of alcohol warmth. I would like even more coffee flavor.    Overall, it's very good, bold flavor stout. It really is a great morning brew and i would like to try it a few more times to get a consistent idea of what it is. Grade is an A

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Ok, so let me start-off with a preface. My wifey brings home a lot of, free, dark chocolates...which we always end up giving away.     Now back to the review.     I always drink my stouts a little cooler than room temperature. I do this because I love the head, and because I get the best aromas off the head this way.     First-off...the color was spectacular. The oats gave it a super full body/richness, which also made it super thick and dark.     I grabbed a 350-lumen flashlight, and I could FAINTLY see a dark tan around the very edges of the glass. With a regular flashlight, I could not see any light at all.     Awesome! I love my stouts super dark and full-bodied.    The head was also thick. (I tilt the glass 45° and fill it half way. Then I straighten the glass and slam the rest of the bottle/can into the glass for a nice head).     The bubbles were super small and tight. And it also left a super nice lace.     Mind you, this is a smidgen cooler than room temps. I’m guessing at around 65° F.     As for the smell...it was also great. But sadly (like I started with my preface), I dislike dark chocolate. And the smell was very prevalent with dark chocolate.     The taste was fantastic. I loved that it was not overly bitter at all. As a matter of fact, it was creamy and smooth.     But that dark chocolate taste was extremely prevalent...which I did not like.     Mind you, this is just me. If you like the dark chocolate smell and taste, this might be for you.     But it wasn’t for me.     May I also add that it had a high 8.3. ABV. But both me and my wifey did not feel that it was that high at all.     We both agreed that it felt less than Founders regular porter (my favorite), which is only 6.5 ABV.     So the ABV on our 4-pack was weaker than marked.     Weird.     Anyhoo...it was a bit expensive at $11.00 (BevMo) for only 4 bottles.     I guess it had extra ingredients. But I could not get past the dark chocolate taste.     I’m looking around for a clone recipe of this, and I’ll substitute the dark chocolate with cocoa nibs (or maybe caramel), and it’ll probably rock.     But that’s just me.    Great oat stout otherwise.

It's excellent, though I split part of my bottle with a generous host.

Bit of bitterness up front with a bit of carbonation and finishes smooth with nice little taste of chocolate. Glad I finally tried.

Fairly boozy and sweet, with a moderate bitterness that blends nicely with the chocolate for a real cocoa experience. Pretty thick and oh so smooth with moderate to low carbonation bite.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 Look - Dark Dark Dark Black.... light does not stand a chance getting through this one. I got a 1 finger head upon pouring from a Founders squatty 12 oz bottle. The head receded slowly and the lacing and foam ring stuck around the whole time. I can't imagine this one looking any better for a Imperial Stout.    Smell - Nice rich blast of coffee - not too dark of a roast of coffee it seems, but more of a caramelly medium roast. Smells sweet and dessert-like. A lot of Chocolate and a bit of caramel also come through.     Taste - There is a bit of a bite at first but I can't really determine if any come from hops or if it is from the heavily roasted grains and coffee. Somewhat sweet towards the middle, but dries out and gets more 'stout-like' towards the end. Pretty strong chocolate flavor - which is great as most 'chocolate' beers barely show hints of it. Coffee flavor is quite forward here, but not so overpowering that you don't get other flavors - this is very well balanced. Very complex - some wood, nutty, campfire notes fade in and out and increase towards the end. Awesome beer here!    Feel - This is a full bodied beer, but I was expecting it to be a bit thicker. I like my stronger stouts chewy. Can't fault them too much though, it is still pretty thick and rich - carbonation never completely gives out.    Overall - This beer is one that must be tried. Founders recently started distributing this way westward (Colorado) and this one was on my beer bucketlist. I'm very happy to have gotten the opportunity to grab a 4-pack and will continue to grab as many Founders' beers as I can.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 The best damn stout I've ever had. The color is a deep black. It pours almost like a light chocolate syrup, with a dense brown head. The initial flavor really snags your attention and is... hard to describe at first. Good. Yeah, that's the word. Really delicious! Luxurious coffee flavor with a kick of spice, followed by an intense chocolate creaminess, roasty malt, a lick of dark currant, and warm hops. A myriad of bold flavors, all in perfect balance. The drink-ability of this beer is really impressive for the thickness... dangerously alluring. A perfect compliment to this cozy, dark holiday season!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from bottle (bottled on 9/4/18) into a snifter on 10/15/18. Inch of foam on top which took approximately 45-60 to dissipate. Color is black, srm 40+. Aroma is deep sweet maltyness. Taste is complete and full with extra chocolate, very limited alcohol taste as well. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth with mild carbonation and the last notes of flavor floating around just after completing the taste. Overall an Amazing beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Founders Breakfast Stout - 8.8%ABV- 60 IBUs. 12oz bottle dated 7/30/18 - poured into a snifter at slightly too chill.     Pours a pitch black, opaque shade. A hard pour yeilds a finger of cinnamon colored head, receding fairly quickly. Edit: Now that it's mostly gone (the beer), I can see that it's truly a dark dark brown. It looks like coffee concentrate. Deep brownish black, a brilliant sheen, and slick.    Nose is dark chocolate and a heavy hit of cayanne chili. Subtle notes of ground coffee beans and maybe some vanilla. The chili pepper is big though. There's a slight acidity that I'm guessing might be from the coffee that's in here.    Palate is huge bittersweet cocoa and java. Mocha. Finishing much more coffee than chocolate. I'm also getting a touch of that chili pepper, but not nearly as much as the nose would indicate. That hint of acidity translates, to a minor degree, to the palate. Like oily black coffee. It's sweet upfront, and then the roasty toasty comes in and cuts that sweetness in half. There is a slight bitterness to it that is a byproduct from the huge amount of dark roasted malts, rather than from hopping. The big sweet kick keeps that bitterness in check, and helps keep it moving without becoming unpleasant. For an imperial stout, I'd actually say the bitterness is on the lower side, but definitely expect a little more than your favourite 6ABV milk stout.  Warming up, that chili is coming back out, and it truly reminds me of Mexican hot cocoa with a pinch of coffee in it.    The mouthfeel is soft and silky. Rich, slightly viscous, with a nice mouthcoating quality. Thick outmeal character. Carbonation is low, naturally, having to fight through the heft and viscosity of this beer. It's nice and thick and chewy, as the style calls for.    Overall, this is very good. The alcohol is well hidden. The chili pepper note throws me off a tiny bit, but the sweetness works to its benefit. It's well rounded, and not too much of anything. There are stouts I much prefer, but all in all, this is definitely one of the better ones I've had. I'm glad I got to try this one, and it has quite a bit going for it (mouthfeel), but I cannot justify buying a 4 pack, and I can't quite call it world class. This is all subjective. I can see it being the holy grail for some, I guess I just prefer lighter milk stouts. Cheers.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 I am frankly incredulous that I have not previously reviewed & rated this beer! How did I allow it to pass me by for so long? I sought this one out even though it only comes in a Bottle while I am trying to eradicate my backlog. That is indicative of how important it is to me to get this one in.     From the Bottle: "Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout"; "60 IBUs"; "The coffee lover's consummate beer. Brewed with an abundance of flaked oats, bitter and imported chocolates, and two types of coffee, this Stout has an intense fresh-roasted java nose topped with a frothy, cinnamon-colored head that goes forever."    I began by Pop!ping the cap & knowing that it was a very fresh bottle, I proceeded with a C-Line pour. Man, it came up quickly with a pseudo-cascade that formed two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-brown head with excellent retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled like my morning coffee - a mélange of deeply roasted beans from different locales that I blend together each day & fill the basket to the point that the water has to be coaxed through the filter. Rich, strong coffee with hints of chocolate & smoke. Mmm. Mouthfeel was thick, full, rich & creamy, like a dollop of coffee-chocolate ice cream had been scooped onto my tongue. Mmm. The taste was at once chocolaty and coffee-like with a hint of smoke. Mmm. I have had this many times over, but always out in town, where I rarely do field reviews any more. It is always a treat, just like it was tonight. Loads of lacing formed as I drank through the beer, savoring every sip. I guess that I have taken it for granted in the past since my time with it for this review makes me feel like a born-again virgin. It was like I had never experienced it before, while I know that such was not the case. Finish was more chocolaty than coffee, so I am going to say that it was semi-sweet, but if you want to go with semi-dry, I am not going to put up much of a fight. This was a truly enjoyable experience.

Very frothy and very fizzy. Loses it's head pretty soon.  S- Chocolate, vanilla bean, molasses, caramel, oatmeal, and coffee all melded together. Wonderful combination of aromas.  T- I get notes of bitter dark chocolate, sweet vanilla bean, creamy oatmeal, caramel, candied yams, and bitter roasted coffee. A slight alcoholic bite is also noted.  F- Decently thick bodied beer. Wholesome with slight carbonation. Pretty much what you'd expect.  O- Overall an extremely well made stout. What did I expect? CBS and KBS are absolutely phenomenal and some of the best beers I've ever had. This beer is literally the youth version of those. Of course this stout is great.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 5 I like the label design. The picture of the baby eating oatmeal for breakfast is quite appealing. There are a lot of adjuncts in this stout. Some stouts have one adjunct in it like oatmeal, chocolate, or coffee while this stout manages to cram all 3 adjuncts into one stout. I like this beer better than the bourbon barrel aged KBS by the way. The oatmeal gives it a creamy frothy head. I am tasting some chocolate but the main thing that I am tasting is the sumatra coffee. I would not age a stout that has adjunct like coffee or chocolate because both flavors will dissipate over time, matter of fact this beer is better when consumed fresh. This taste like a World Class stout to me. Cheers! A

Sticky and fizzy lacing on glass.    Smell  Nutty, coffee notes with a little booze/hint of alcohol.    Taste  Roasty, chocolatey, with a warm finish and esters; Slight sherry and raisin. Chewy.    Feel  Smooth, velvety, undercarbonated, with a thinned out body (bottle was 2 years old)    ----------    Overall  It was very enjoyable and I would welcome another taste. I think a newer/fresher bottle would do better. This felt very flat and thin.

Smells like a candy shop for adults    T: Creamy malt that plays oh so nicely with the chocolate, coffee, and oats. The bitterness of the roast is the heartbeat of this beer, and bows out with an extended standing ovation.    O: World class stout indeed. So rich and yet so well balanced. This is an extremely drinkable stout. One of the best in class.

But not cloying or sticky. I just don't recall the strength of the coffee hit and it was impressive. F. Smooth, and a little oily, little carbonation. O. Deserves the rating and just so easy to drink and such a flavour hit!

You immediately taste the richest, most delicious black coffee you've ever had in your life, along with premium dark chocolate flavors and a touch of raisin. Full body and creamy mouthfeel with a semi-sweet finish. Absolutely phenomenal.

Saw "founders" on the tap and just asked for whatever it was (thought it would probably be the IPA), barman goes "It's the breakfast stout, it's like 9% alcohol are you sure?". It wasn't the morning (breakfast time) but I of course said "sure" and got a nice pour of this silky black beer in a little snifter glass.     I joked to the wife that I don't think this is something you'd have for breakfast (unless you were a raging alcoholic) and she informed me that the name was ironic and that was the point of the name and I missed it. We sat at the table and I sipped this beer. Smooth as heck with a coffee aroma and heavy body. Went down almost without a trace, not leaving any heavy metallic residual taste that I sometimes find with a stout. Enjoyed this beer while waiting on the steak with not a bad buzz to boot. Good stout.

Simply delicious and satisfying. Top notch!

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 I was able to finally procure a 4-pack of this here in my part of North Carolina... And it was worth the wait. Upon opening the bottle, the aroma was absolutely intoxicating (in a good way) and enticing. The heavy (also in a good way) chocolate flavor was smooth and not thr least bit heavy (the bad heavy, the one that bloats). It was actually a bit light on the palate, shich I did not expect. As a long-time fan of Guinness Stout, this was a very satisfying pour. Will definitely grab all of it that I can find here and suggest that you do the same if you're reading this.

On the nose you get strong aromas of roasted Kona and dark chocolate. Coffee aromas are pleasant in this one. Coffee notes hit the palate very distinctly as notes of chocolate that are almost mocha-like in balance finish the experience. This stout is not overly thick or sweet and is quite smooth. There is a touch of carbonation that balances very well with the smoothness and balance of the beer. I’ve had this beer many times and each time I do it reminds me why this one is timeless for me.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 355 ml bottle, from Vinmonopolet Kvadrat. ABV is 8.3%, IBU 60. Pitch black colour, moderate to low tan head, not the best retention.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This is different than other reviews you can find as rather than regular gas carb, Brass Tap added Nitrogen making it a Nitro Stout. The addition of Nitrogen to a beer gives way to much smaller bubbles, creating a smoother, creamier experience. Beyond mouthfeel, there are variances in appearance and smell as well. Because of that, this has a much more defined taste! Poured a dark tan, thick head that lasted! I let it sit for about 10 minutes before tasting. The nose is ALL roasted malt and coffee with dark or baker’s chocolate. My mouth watered just from the smell! The taste was exactly what the head precluded it would be. The right amount of bitterness with the coffee up front. Smokiness from the roasted malt and I caught a bit of vanilla on the back. Drinking it cold and right from the tap, I doubt the vanilla note would show itself. So much flavor! Mouthfeel was creamy with the right amount of lactose sugar to make it almost like a good chocolate milk. Very well done!! I could pour this over Cocoa Puffs and enjoy, as this IS a breakfast stout, so why not?!

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Wow! I picked up a 4 pack of 12oz bottles. Poured into 16oz snifter    L: deep dark black with a dark tan head. Not very much head, especially for a snifter, and it dissipated quickly.     S: deep roasty malts blended seamlessly with coffee, with a definite presence of semi sweet chocolate. Very, very deep, rich smell.     T: very much like the smell. Coffee is most present, but a distinct taste of malts and an obvious lingering of chocolate afterwards. Very smooth. The 60 ibu advertised on the label is extremely misleading. If anything there is a slight bitterness from the coffee, but i think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone describe this as bitter. Very well balanced. Truly delicious.    F: the mouthfeel is just right for the style. Extremely thick, almost creamy, and just enough carbonation to not make it seem watered down. Excellent.    O: I love a good stout/porter, and I think this might be my favorite next to bell's. The 8% abv is very well hidden. It's almost too smooth really. Id recommend this to anyone. It would even be a good one for someone new to craft beer.

I actually enjoyed this beer almost as much as the KBS, quite possibly because it wasn’t as hyped (and perhaps my expectations were much higher for the KBS). Nice deep rich black color, scant head with nice lingering lacing. Smells of dark chocolate and coffee, tastes even better. Nice notes of coffee, caramel, dark chocolate, some malt and molasses. Very faint alcohol taste, which is also present in the lingering finish. Great mouthfeel, quite smooth and not too thin. Mild carbonation throughout. A pleasure to sip and savor.

From the strange Rockwell-GarbagePailKids artwork, to the price/quality ratio of the four-pak, to the taste, this just rocks. Pour is honestly a bit boring, pitch black with not too much head. Pour on the Ale Smith Stout is much better, for example, but the taste is fantastic, as is the mouthfeel. Super smooth chocolate/malt -> sweet oatmeal -> quality coffee transition. Fan-fucking-tastic. Mouthfeel is full, like a good breakfast.

The head slowly dissipates and there was nice lacing on the glass.    Smells of sweet coffee with some stone fruits dancing around.    Picking up some chocolate on the taste up front. Taste is more sweet chocolate with the coffee relegated to play in the background. As the beer warms the coffee starts to come out a bit more. Still that chocolate is pushing the front of the taste. Stone fruits like raisins show upin the far background.    Mouth feel is on the heavy end of medium yet very smooth. The oatmeal makes the mouth a bit heavier but adds a luscious creaminess.    This is a pretty complex stout. I like the addition of the oatmeal for the wonderful mouth and a touch more sweet. For fans and advocates of the darker beers Founders does these so well and this is a very good example. There is a slight touch of alcohol warming to it that I like. This tells you this is a big guy and would also work while sitting around a fire at the ski lodge to take off the chill from the slopes. Cheers!

Taste is outstanding; again chocolate, coffee,vanilla ,anise,toffee? Feels super smooth. I am assuming that their is oats in the mash. Oats give it that super creamy luscious feel. Overall this still rocks! Revision: 1/15/2019 Not sure why I waited until last year to review? To get to the point in my opinion both KBS and baby Breakfast stout have been compromised. They were like the restaurant that opened with stellar reviews and gourmet food. They made there millions and now we are left with this in it's place. Not nearly as luxurious chocolate feel, what happened to the decadent creamy coffee? Overall I think their marketing technique sucks. Great,they now have a home in the Caribbean and we are left with this mediocre beer-   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 This is one of the best Chocolate/Coffee stouts you can get, and it's created with oatmeal as well.

Smells of roasted malts and coffee, with a strong dark chocolate aroma and just a hint of spiceyness: nutmeg, cinnamon, coming through as well, Taste follows the nose, with a very nice balance of roasted malt, coffee and dark, bitter chocolate. There's also a certain earthy note and mild spiceyness to this that is reminiscent of nutmeg/cinnamon. Finishes with a strong bitterness for the style. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. Honestly, I think this is great, but not amazing. Very nice balance, but not that complex. Also, mouthfeel/body, while not bad, could be a little thicker. I definitely prefer Narwhal.

One of the most opaque stouts I have seen, with a rich burgundy red  head to boot, which had dissipated within minutes, leaving behind a  ebony jewel. A truly bold example, and a textbook stout aesthectic.    Smell  Chocolate! Creamy, succulent, mouth-watering cocoa hit me immediately, followed  by coffee, some nutmeg, oats, concluding with a roasted hoppiness. Truth  be told, it is the most dynamic smelling stout I have tried! Aeration brought the  coffee front and center, revieling what seemed that of dark fruits (blackberries,   black cherries, etc.)    Taste  My goodness, we have a winner! This stout is remarkable! A frighteningly dynamic  pallet hits you with haste; the most outstanding flavors being chocolate and roasted coffee,  with almost the consistency of cappuccino. Slight aeration within the mouth dug up overtones of  blackberries, honey, and nutmeg, which was a wonderful surprise. With a pallete as varied as this,  the breakfast stout could please just about anyone. Given its ABV rating, the taste of alcohol was far   down on my list.    Feel  Incredible, and thick! An amalgamtion of creams and soups - almost as rich as steamed machiato. No alcohol burn  at all, going down easily. The warmth of this stout is strong, sitting heavily in the stomach. It was   a comforting experience making it perfect for the bitterness of January.    Overall  Founders has yet to deter my interest, although this stout sticks out with such tenacity. I have  yet to try a stout as exciting and open ended as this. Well done, Michigan!   
look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 An exceptional stout, the flavor is balanced, and the chocolate and coffee jump right out, with just the right amount mealyness in the background. The first half of the beer is a solid 5 in every category. The only reason I dropped the overall to a 4.25 is because the second half starts to become a bit overbearing in terms of sweetness and heavyness. Not a beer I could drink back to back but still an exceptional beer

Almost no lacing. Full, lasting, head and thick lacing would boost the score higher, but personally I place 80% of my opinion on taste, and this tastes great Tastes of chocolate and coffee, and the finish is moist, alcohol with a hint of bitterness, but not overbearing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Aftertaste is gone quickly and leaves no lingering bitterness which is really nice. There is way less bitterness than the 60 IBU would indicate. The ABV is 8.30% which is pretty high. The beer doesn't taste that alcoholic, but you definitely feel that alcohol after a glass. (Well, at least I do). Overall a great beer, with my only wish being a lesser price than the $12 I had to pay for a 4-pack. Founders makes a great, beer, though, and they deserve every penny.

Thick fluffy tan head on top about the size of a thumb.    I smell a strong scent of roasted coffee beans, toffee, molasses, vanilla, dark chocolate, and oats.     The taste has a strong espresso composition. Oddly I taste black olives but it's welcoming. Along with that, there are notes of molasses, vanilla, raisins, prunes, roasted nuts, and dark chocolate. Altogether pretty bitter, but excellent. Feel delicately creamy.    A great treat.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 It seem quite silly, in my opinion, to drink this beer cold. I had one at fridge temp yesterday and I was profoundly disappointed. I have basically been saving the experience of trying this beer for later in my life since two years ago. Trying it for a second time now at room temperature and it is considerably more complex and balanced, but idk, just not blown away. I think I'd like KBS or CBS much more.    L: Incredibly dark. Just a trace of reddish cola color can be noted at the edges of the body when held to light, but it's as dark as espresso. A thin film of cappuccino foam lingers on top, and leaves sticky waves of lacing on the glass.    S: Roast coffee, espresso, black olives, dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, toffee, prunes, raisins, vanilla, milk, oatmeal, cloves, and coffee. The coffee don't quit. It's a fantastic aroma, but if you wish to appreciate it, I hope you like coffee.    T: Salty as hell. Oddly enough, there is just an edge of oatmeal flavor right before the anticipatedly huge coffee note, which dances around the vanilla, dark chocolate, molasses, toffee, dried fruit, and black olives, all the way to the finish. It ends in almost entirely plain charcoal with a touch of unsweetened chocolate and coffee acidity. Alcohol is difficult to make out in all of that. If it was flat, you could easily mistake it for a mildly sweetened cold brew. Btw, when cold, the only detectable flavors are the chocolate, coffee and olives.    F: Super drinkable. Nice thickness. To my taste, it could be just a smidge thicker and more syrupy, but that's probably exactly how KBS is.    O: This brew reminds me very much of my first ever Russian Imperial Stout, Old Rasputin by North Coast. A touch less salty and with much more coffee flavor, it is also a delectable offering, but not one that I see as superior at all. If anything, I think I prefer Old Rasputin. In my honest opinion, BCBS, Narwhal, Victory at Sea, and even Founders' own porter all blow this out of the water. I'm still eager to try the barrel-aged editions, but thus far, I don't see what all the hype is about.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 355 mL bottle from an LCBO 4-pack; best before July 8 2018 and served barely chilled. First 'had' in 2015, though I've re-sampled it roughly a half-dozen times since then. Needless to say, It's long overdue for a review.    This jet black stout comes equipped with a quarter-inch of frothy, tan-coloured head that fades away within 90 seconds; the only significant remnants are a tight, creamy collar and some foamy patches of bubbles floating upon the surface. Smells quite rich and rather sweet - I'm getting subtle notes of prune and date underneath a torrent of roasted malt goodness. Dark chocolate, treacle and toffee are more prominent than notes of earthy coffee grounds; there are also minor aspects of ethanol, vanilla, coffee cake and herbal licorice.    Seriously yummy stuff - there's an array of competing flavours, but that's fine by me because they melt together perfectly. Flavours of dark chocolate, cocoa powder and oatmeal sweetness come through at first, along with some molasses and caramelized malts. This is followed closely by fruity hints of fig and date - an important inclusion, because we all know that fruit is a vital component of any balanced breakfast. The coffee grounds start to kick in towards the back end, offering up an earthy bitterness as well as a pleasant roasted quality that will bring a smile to the face of any coffee addict. Coffee and chocolate both linger into the aftertaste, almost completely masking the alcohol content. If I didn't need to drive to work in the morning, I think I would actually be tempted to substitute this for my usual 8 AM java. In the vicinity of full-bodied, with light carbonation that meekly nudges the surfaces of the palate, to little effect - feels silky-smooth and soft in the mouth. I can't think of any other imperial stouts I've tried that went down the hatch with such sublime ease.    Final Grade: 4.38, a superlative A grade. Founders Breakfast Stout lives up to its hype. This is an excellent imperial stout with deep, complex, well-integrated flavour combinations - yet it's also one that I could drink on the regular. Ontario BAs should probably buy this one in bulk while it's still available - there really aren't any genuinely comparable alternatives (domestic or otherwise) at the LCBO right now.

Smell: For such a complex flavor the smell is very light. Some sharp sweet tones with a very subtle under tone of chocolate and oats.    Taste: This beer is probably my new second favorite under the locally brewed West O CocO stout for its bold and incredibly rich taste alone. The oats, coffee and dark chocolate mix perfectly giving it a balance between sweet and bitter without being over powering. There's even a whisper of hopps in the mix, but for those who dislike IPAs or overly bitter tastes this may not be a good beer to test the waters with. The after taste is, on its own, a unique feature and reminds me of biting into a piece of a Dove dark chocolate bar or taking a sip of Zak Wilde's Death Wish coffee.    Feel: The feel is heavier than your typical milk/cream stouts, but not like chugging a bottle of maple syrup.    Overall: This beer is fantastic and pairs well with a bowl of actual oatmeal or toast; however, light weights be ware of the 8.3% ABV and save this brew for after work. With the balance of sweet and bitter, roasty oats and dark chocolate, with just a touch of hopps and latte, this brew is more than likely not for the beginner stout connoisseur, but can easily become a favorite, and coffee drinkers are sure to love this stout. Another tasty beer from my northern neighbors in Michigan.

It is very good, but the lack of notable malts is disappointing; the malt is why I love stouts. Still a good beer overall though.

A touch of good funky booze in the background.   T: Spiced, but not peppery heavy roasted chocolate coffee, more dark and bitter than sweet. Has a unique funkiness to it.   F: Strong and robust but not rude and unpleasant. Has a creaminess to it.   O: Pushes the envelope like any Imperial should. Not my favorite of this genre but must be experienced by any connoisseur.

It is very well hidden. I guess I'm not a big fan of stouts (my highest rated beer is a stout.. go figure! I'm confused too). I can respect what is being down in this beer but it just doesn't suit my palette that much. Every time I sip this beer it reminds me of another beer I've had that I really disliked but this tastes better than that. I think it was Oskar Blues' Ten Fidy. I'm going off memory I think it tastes like that minus the ridiculous amount of hops. I can imagine this beer being really enjoyed by stout drinkers who also like hops. There is some bitterness in this beer. I think that's where it loses me a bit. If it was boringly smooth (malty with much less hops) I'd probably love this stuff.    One word that keeps on coming into my head when I sip this beard is "tangy". Not exactly sour, but I sort of want to do a salsa dance for some reason. haha.    When I taste this beer I taste coffee first. It is certainly coffee dominate, then a little bit of cocoa, hops, and a tangy/acidic (probably from the coffee since coffee is very acidic) like after taste.

You could never say this is lacking on the body as far as style goes. It’s thick.   Overall, this is always a treat.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip. Bottled 10/20/17.    Appearance: totally black with two finger of frothy dark-tan foam atop. Dig it!    Smell: rich, smooth coffee right at first, segueing into a sweeter, chocolatier, maltier character. Very nice indeed.    Taste: tons of coffee at first, transitioning into a more chocolate-based flavor at the end; it's got the same dynamics as the aroma. Finish is deep and bitter, very much like a dark chocolate. Nicely complex and very tasty indeed.    Mouthfeel: rich body with a low-to-moderate carbonation; it's not super creamy, but it's not bad either.    Overall: a very good beer indeed. I am very happy we now get Founders distributed in Washington.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 (Poured moderately from a 12oz bottle into a snifter)    Immediately as the beer exits the mouth of the bottle, you notice how dark and oily the Founders Breakfast stout is. Pure jet black appearance and spawns a fine, flat beige head that lingers for a minute or two after hitting the glass.    The nose is dominated by unsweetened espresso followed by extra dark chocolate and yeast. The aromas are not overbearing but pleasantly noticeable during each sip.     For the taste, the dark chocolate begins to shine through along with the roasty espresso. As the beer warms after a few minutes, notes of heavy cream and minute spikes of smoke and salt can be detected at the tip of your tongue. The flavors are all evenly distributed over a creamy texture creating a mellow and very drinkable stout thats not "in your face" by any means, but has just enough complexity to lure you in for a second sip.

Drink it fresh if you prefer a strong coffee taste. Wait a few months for a perfect blend. Wait over 5 months, or up to a year, if chocolate is your thing and you want a more complex taste.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.75 I feel kind of bad about not being wild about this beer. Founders' stuff is almost always a notch or two above average. This one is just not too appealing to me. Yes, it smells of coffee. Yes, it is malty. Yes, there is chocolate. But the overall taste is of very bitter, extremely dark chocolate that kind of bites at the back of the throat. Obviously, from the reviews, that kind of flavor appeals to many.    It looks lovely, though. Oil black - viscous. The smell is... kind of acrid. It sure is not lacking in flavor. But it's not a flavor that I find pleasant. My ratings are on the generous side, probably because the beer is from Founders.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Color is so dark I'll call it black. Small tan cap.    Aroma of roasted malt and coffee but not heavily so. There is something almost sweet in the background which I presume is chocolate.    Taste is roast malt/coffee on entry and this holds until the end. Bitterness from whatever source is a bit more pronounced at the finish and in the aftertaste.    Full texture with balancing carbonation.    This one is better put together than most Stouts I've tasted. The flavors are simple but so well knit together it gives off a sense of complexity even though it relies on simple flavors. IBU is listed as 60 but I really don't taste that level of hopping present. Brewer mentions imported chocolate which to me means dark, bitter chocolate in the European style and while I don't actually taste that in this brew there is decidedly something extra in the overall flavor. I understand why this is so popular.

Pleasant mild bitterness complements the flavors nicely. If there is a perfect marriage between beer, coffee, and chocolate, this is definitely it. So well balanced and buttery smooth. After trying this for the first time I decided to see how well the breakfast thing would work. Had it late morning with a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. Don't judge me and, yes, it was freaking phenomenal!

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 For a non-barrel aged stout it's about as good as it can get when drunk fresh. I've had this beer with some age in it and coffee and chocolate fades leaving a harsh alcohol bite. But when drunk fresh it is super creamy with flavors of vanilla, coffee, chocolate, and oats along with a gentle dose of smoked malts. Can barely taste alcohol and is quite delicious. Only complaint is I wish it got shipped in late November vs October. October is still a bit warm and this would be perfect to drink in the winter morning watching the snow fall but by the time that happens it's no longer fresh and therefore won't taste as delicious.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 .Appearance: Pitch black motor oil, one finger tan head. No visuable carbonation. Head dissipates quickly. Great looking beer.     .Aroma: Powerful scent of roasted coffee/freshly ground coffee. Notes of toffee, carmalized sugar, caramel, molasses, but mostly just a beautifully rich scent of gourmet coffee.     .Taste: Roasted coffee, raw coffee bean, molasses and a slight malt sweetness upfront. A complex combination of flavor all giving way to an earthy, smokey finish. A nice subtle bitterness towards the end really adds beautiful balance. The finish is long and lingering, with a warm alcohol exhale.     .Palate: Luxurious cream like texture, velvety, rich, sticky. Medium to full body. Subtle carbonation, just right.     .Overall: A    .This beer is something else. A coffee lovers dream, but so much more. Great complex flavors, a perfect subtle sweetness, and a nice amount of bitterness. A long, smooth finish leaving a delicious taste that won't go away. Coffee bomb.     Fantastic   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Bottled on '09.01.17'.  Dark tan head on very dark, opaque body, Thicker head with good coverage of lacing.  Coffee and chocolate dominate on the aroma, dark roasted backbone.  Very balanced flavor of dark sweet chocolate, slightly bitter but flavorful coffee, and roasted malt. Fades away with all tastes in balance.  Smooth, somewhat creamy mouth feel, on the dry side.  A wonder for those who enjoy a heavily coffee infused stout with chocolate balance.

Taste: Immediately stout malt. Heavy overtones of deep, dark roast coffee and smokey roasted bean. Ends with a sensational dark cacao sweetness that lingers.  Feel: Sticky and dry. Bitter dryness sticks to tongue with each sip. Remains very heavy in the stomach. Sip this beer or suffer. And keep water on hand.  Overall: A delightful and very stout beer from Founder's.

I don't detect as much chocolate as I do coffee, but it might just be my taste buds. This is my go-to when I don't want to buck up for Dragon's Milk because it's 90% as good at 2/3rds the cost and 2/3rds the alcohol content. Pick your poison. I'm too cheap to do Dragon's Milk all the time, so Founder's Breakfast Stout does right by me. I really love it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 I agree with everyone else- fantastic beer. Best Oatmeal Stout out there! Pours black as pitch - looks like it ought to taste. Attractive carmel head that lingers for a while. Aromas of chocolate and roasted grains. Taste - amazing. Pleasant and rich on the front end - lingering bitterness on the back end. The most flavorful Oatmeal Stout ever. Aptly named - full of breakfast flavors.

Have not the willpower (or nose) to stick around, onto the taste ...    The Coffee outshines even the vanilla-Oat, as the chocolate approaches with zest around the bend. With all that flavor,(Especially Kona: the subtle, second coffee, see pining for Pipeline!), it's booze sneaks up a bit. 8.3% seems a wise choice, one among many for this brew!!

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Appearance: beer was bottled 10/18/16 according to the label. Been in my fridge for a couple of months, not sure how it was stored prior to my acquisition.   Beer is dark as FUCK. Nice mocha colored head, fell pretty rapidly. Lazy lacing throughout session.    Aroma: tons of chocolate. Dark fruits. Plums. Hint of dust.    Flavor: heavy chocolate notes. Medium heavy slightly stale coffee notes. Medium sweetness. Just a touch of booze.    Medium bodied beer, slightly warming alcohol sensation. Moderate carbonation.    Overall: Ironically I had the KBS over a decade ago, and I'm just now getting around to trying the basebeer. It was pretty underwhelming. One dimensional chalky chocolate and stale coffee flavors dominate. This might have been mind blowing 10 years ago, but there are some serious coffee stout and porter contenders now that this thing pales in comparison to. Still have love for Founders, but in 2017 this beer doesn't deserve a second look. Could use a major refresher from the brewery--there are better ways to incorporate chocolate and coffee in the brewing process that would massively improve this beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I am comparing two bottles, one bottled 9/26/17 and the other at 8/22/16 - having held on to this one for over a year now.    8/22/16: Pours black, very carbonated - more than expected; tan colored foam. Aroma is sweet, some chocolate and even a syrupy bourbon linger in the nose; not detecting any coffee... flavor may have faded during aging. Flavor and mouthfeel follow the aroma and over-carbonation. Not picking up any coffee flavor again, other than the stouts dark nature granting similarity. Not a bad stout. ~7.5/10    9/26/17: Pours just as dark, much less carbonation with less head. Aroma is COFFEE. I am amazed that these beers are the same. Coffee dominates and chocolate is quick to mix in giving me the impression of mocha. First sips are congratulated by an awesome rich dark chocolate and coffee blend. A masterpiece! 10/10!    In the end, I am tempted to dump the rest of the older product as it seems to have much less character; not well aged I suppose? The 2017 release seems to have captured the coffee and chocolate more than I remember - having consumed these for a few years now. I continued to compare these side-by-side and the results are confirmed.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Pours nearly black with a slow forming & soon gone dark tan head. It’s aroma is chocolate candy bar. The flavor is as advertised & much more intense than the aroma: oats, dark roast coffee & dark chocolate. A perfect balance of sweet, salty & bitter. Perfect viscosity & adequate carbonation for a very smooth feel. Finishes with a dry coffe bitterness that is very pleasing. No need to brew the French roast & pour a bowl of cereal, Founbers Breakfast Stout is the perfect way to start your day.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 This is my all time favorite stout. The balance of coffee and bitter sweet chocolate is incredible. It tastes like oatmeal with chocolate syrup. The drinkabaility of this stout is unmatched.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12oz bottle dated 09/29/16  Dark opaque brown body allows no light through and is capped with a persistent light brown 1/8in head.    Aromas include bitter roasted coffee bean and cocoa powder.  Flavors match with less emphasis on the coffee after a year.  Mouthfeel is creamy, if slightly thin and barely chalky with a nice dry finish.    Overall waiting a year was a good experiment. Still a fantastic beer.

The beer pours dense dark brown, nearly black with red tinted mocha head. No light penetrates this beer at any angle. The head recedes to a thin ring and paper thin island. Aroma is as advertised. Chocolate, coffee, and roast malt abound. Taste is slightly tangy sweetish malt and chocolate giving way to a bitter coffee finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied, adequately carbonated, creamy and dry. To pull of a perfect tasty dry finish in a beer like this is somewhat magical. Overall, great. This beer is really good but anyone adverse to coffee or bitterness might want to wade in gently. This presents itself more bitter than any 60 IBU in my recollection. Note: This beer became more enjoyable and balanced as it warmed. If you don't love the first few sips, let it warms a bit and retry.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 had out of the bottle. a sharp stout with a little thinner body but has a bite with the coffee and chocolate flavor. the finish has a bit of a vanilla taste which leaves a nice aftertaste.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured into various glassware over the years, the appearance was a jet black color with a one finger tan foamy head that slid off to allow a glistening spider web lace in the wake. The aroma had some sweet to grainy oatmeal then a mix of chocolate/coffee blend underscored by an earthy hop base, then a moderate roast. The flavor was a lively blend of the sweetness of the oatmeal to chocolate to coffee and subsequently lead into the aftertaste with a fine smooth roast. Hops seem to be extremely faint. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with some sessionable traits to it. Semi-dry finish with a good carbonation about it. ABV felt as projected. Overall, I have aged many of these over the years, but they never really seem to age past 9 months as the coffee portion does end up becoming acidic. So drink fairly fresh, friends!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Pours solid black with some ruby highlights into a gravity pint glass the same temperature as the beer. Nice solid two and one half finger mocha head thats hangs around. Nice lacing. No legs. Dark coffee hits the nose first followed by semisweet chocolate and dark roasted malts. Licorice. Maybe some smokey molasses?    Taste follows the nose with bold dark roasted coffee, bitter chocolate malts, and some sweet grains. Sweet oaty goodness. Very smooth despite the bitter coffee. Full mouthfeel with good carbonation. Definitely not a stout for non coffee lovers.    Overall a good solid stout. Big enough but not boozy. Very drinkable. Enjoy! Cheers!!   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 2.5 This has a very good taste. Sweet and coffee taste, low carbonation, and looks good too. The problem is the richness, this is not something that I would want to drink an entire 12 oz serving of. This is like a very rich chocolate cake, just a little bit is all you want or you will be sick and bloated. There is no real bitterness to counter the sweetness and it becomes disgusting after too much.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Pours silky and rich, pitch black. No way you're seeing through the glass with this tasty chocolate, hoppy, coffee blend stress reliever. The coffee blend compliments the chocolate well once it hits your nose. Just let the next drink rest in the back of your mouth and breath through your nose, phenomenal! This gives you the full hop you need, coming from a long time IPA fan. The only downfall for this beer is that it is olny a seasonal, as I have wiped out every store in our city:) That was in May! I would love to be able to purchase this year-round! Cheers To Founders!

I'm just not into the charred/burnt coffee thing and bitter finish. Guess I'm a sweet stout guy... BUT I still always buy you when I see you Founders BS - maybe it's better when it's first released. I always get it like 7 months into the year. I will keep trying you though...I will never give up!    Update: tried this again at room temp (65 degrees) and it was much much better. That burnt coffee bitter finish was gone. very tasty beer. keep this one away from the fridge

Recently purchased from a reliable source, this was bottled 7 months ago, hopefully it’s ok at 8.3 percent. Pours a hearty, two finger, milk chocolate colored head into my can-style glass. The body is completely black, with an odd amount of carbonation sticking to the side of the glass. Looks beefy so far.    Yeah I mean the nose doesn’t get much better than this. Huge coffee, and enough chocolate to keep my mouth watering. Fresh, dry, roasty, bitter coffee is the dominating aroma on the nose, but there is a sweet backbone to it. It smells amazing.    The flavor is huge. Coffee flavor is even more in your face on the flavor than in the aroma. Not what I would call a sweet beer for the most part, bitter coffee definitely dominates. Finishes with a slight cinnamon flavor, almost reminds me of mexican spiced coffee. Chocolate is just barely here. It’s a fantastic flavor, though I would have hoped for something slightly more balanced, as the aroma was suggesting.    The mouthfeel is alright. The body is honestly a little thin for a beer that is supposed to be your breakfast. Carbonation is just a tad below medium. It works, but something more chewy would be preferred.    The drinkability is very high for an 8.3% beer, you don’t get any heat at all, and it tastes fantastic.    Overall this is a pretty simple beer to review, it’s loaded with coffee, and not a lot else. Again, I would have hoped for something slightly more balanced, and maybe a little more complex, but what it does, it does well. Anyways, it’s still a fantastic beer.    The appearance turned out pretty good. I got lacing from the top to the bottom, though it was somewhat inconsistent. The head was average, as was retention. Overall a good looking beer, nothing more.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Bottled on 9/29/16 printed on label.  12 oz. bottle poured into shifter.    Poured thick and dark like black gold, with 2 fingers of lasting, reddish brown, cinnamon colored bubbly head that is quick to build with a swirl of the snifter. Smells and tastes of coffee and chocolate with slight notes of roast and a hint of booze. Moderately bittersweet and well balanced. Finishes clean with semi-sweet chocolate flavor. Mouth feel is full bodied, smooth and creamy with low carbonation. This one lives up to the hype and is great for breakfast! Pairs well with breakfast sandwiches and chocolate covered raised or cake donuts.

Taste is still good but has lost half of the chocolate and coffee flavors. The feel is also thinned out a little with excellent carbonation still. Overall I can really enjoy this even though I feel more like I am drinking a coffee ale than the rich stout it was when brewed in September. This stout is best fresh within four or five months.

I prefer prairie coffee noir over this. Stronger coffee and a thicker feel. But for the price this is a top notch beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 I had big expectation about this beer, but it couldn’t meet mine due to lack of complex esters from yeast. taste is overly dominated by bitter coffee and it begins to be bored after first sips. on the other hand it’s really quality brew and has nice big head retention.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Bottled 09/08/16. Head doesn't last forever, as the bottle says lol. Smells of chocolate, coffee. Nose is very sweet. Reminds me of lactose/milk stout sweet. Chocolate, coffee, roasty. What more is to say, the beer is well known for a reason. Like a more affordable Trinity chocolate river.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Vice dark appearance. Little head. Definite coffee aroma. Coffee taste is not the best I have ever had. A little thin for a stout. No alcohol taste.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 A-Strong black colour with a moka brown head that lingers  S-Aroma of coffee and chocolate with vanilla and caramel undertones  M-Thick and viscous and heavy, carbonation is low and obedient  T-Sweet and rich upfront with a coffee and dark chocolate bitterness that balances things out. The bitterness remains as an aftertaste, like fldribking that morning cup of Joe...  O-Amazing brew.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A thick, near-black pour with a finger of tan head.    Nose is coffee, dark chocolate, tobacco, and cherry.    I'm a daily coffee drinker who can appreciate something bitter, but I think this is almost singularly bitter mid-palate. I say mid-palate because it finishes fairly smooth. The finish is when the raisin, cherry, and bakers chocolate come through. But it opens a touch over-carbonated, with stiff pine.    Overall, 8/10.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 this is a great bear, it looks great. dark just the way it should be. smells wonderful and tastes even better. It is so smooth and you can really taste all the hints that they say. i really smell the coffee but am happy that i do not taste it all that much.
