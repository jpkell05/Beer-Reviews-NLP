look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 16oz can. Brewed 1/02/19  Poured into English pint glass producing an inch of fluffy off white head, with light lacing on side of glass. Color is deep copper hue with some light filtering through. A bit darker than I expected.  Nose gives up a red ale scent, caramel, a bit of hop. Toasted malt with a bit of biscuit.  First taste reminds me of an imperial red ale. Big, bold taste. Flavor melts to a smoot malt background ending with a slight bitter finish and a delightful alcohol warmth.   Medium mouth feel with just enough carbonation to tickle the tongue.    This beer sets the bar for a year round strong ale. A bit in your face but for a beer that’s available year round, a superb choice. If you are looking to shake up your taste profile and are a fan of ales, than you need to try this one. Nothing fancy. No barrel aging, no coffee, no gimmicks. Just a kick ass ale with a depth and complexity to keep you coming back.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Reviewed as part of BJCP training, 22B American strong ale. Enjoy by 4/09/19    Pours a huge frothy tan dense head with great retention and lacing, clear but dark ruby copper color    Nose brings hops out front, citrus, pine, then malts, toasted reddish malts, plenty of caramel and toasted bread crusts, almost coffee like roast    Taste big sweet like malts, rich reddish toasty malts, toasted bread crust, plenty of caramel and a little toffee, hint of malt derived fruit, big hops, very bitter to balance the big sweet malt, hops again bringing citrus, pine, and spicy flavors, a touch of warming alcohol, drier medium full attention, huge bitter spicy piney hops, touch more alcohol    Mouth is fuller bodied, just a touch of warming but smooth alcohol, astringency gets a little high but not too much, fairly high carbonation    Overall def within style although less of the new world hops but that's more likely because this beer came out long before there were many new world hops and essentially defined the style. It's in its own world of beers, enjoyable but almost undrinkable

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Poured from a bomber into a glass tankard.    L - I really like how this beer looks. It's a really dark amber red with just the tiniest bit of haziness. It has a nice creamy head that stuck around for some time. Not much lacing, but the mug was still a little wet when I poured the beer in, so that might have something to do with it...    S - It really smells nice. I don't drink dark beers very often, so smelling a grain forward brew is kind of refreshing. Toasted, rye maybe? (still learning to distinguish grains). Sweet, malty, nutty, caramely. It smells nice, pretty simple aroma, nothing special.    T - WAY more hops forward than I expected. That piney hop bitterness really dominates the flavor here, with just a background of the malt I go with the smell. Coffee flavors are right up there with pine hops...It's a really bitter beer, which I don't exactly hate, but there's a right way and a wrong way to incorporate bitterness. I feel like this beer just went out of it's way to be almost offensively bitter.    F - I really enjoyed how this beer felt. It's silky, creamy, and coats your mouth in a good way.     Overall - This beverage looks and smells great, reminiscent of a stout, although it's clearer and a bit less smokey on the nose. It's a very bitter beer, and I guess they warn you on the label "This is an aggressive beer. You probably won't like it". I don't hate it, but it feels like it's stuck somewhere between an IPA and a stout. Not bad, just not for me

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 This is my first and only review. I created this account just to give this beer a review. First of all, I am biased. I used to live in San Diego and have always like Stone Brewery. Secondly, I am not a beer aficionado by any means. I cant go deep into articulating what makes a beer good. All I know is if I like it or not. I actually drink Hefeweizens a lot more which is the complete opposite of IPAs in term of taste, but ABA still ranks #uno for me.    With that out of the way, I usually drink it out of the 22oz bottles. Their branding is a little trollish imo but it doesnt really take anything away from the experience. Love the dark color. Hops instantly fill your nostrils when you pop the cap. Other reviewers smell fruity aromas, I dont. Its straight hops for me and kind of musky smelling. The first sip is always the best...BOOM, a freaking atom bomb in your mouth. Yes, its hoppy and its strong. Deal with it. The taste sticks with you the whole time, it never abates and is always at full mass. I agree with other reviewers who say there are hints of coffee. I have been to the brewery near San Diego and I know they don't use coffee as an ingredient, but the flavor is there somehow. This beer has a bite to it, bitter and sticky. Not to be binged or chugged. A nice beer to chill with and maybe use as a beverage for a meal, though, I tend to like it by itself. Drinking to whole 22oz should get you nice and warm but like I said, it should never be binged and you shouldn't be sauced off you butt.    So thats my rant. Very personal beer for me. Good taste and a good experience. Cheers!   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Popped the cap on a bomber of this one while relaxing in my hotel room. I can see where some may really enjoy this one, but I can't get the appeal. There's lots of malt, and a certain aggressiveness. But rather than a hop aggressiveness it tastes rand feels more like a rake across the tongue. I assume this is what they're going for, but it's not for me.

I honestly hated the beer at first. Bastard really is not worthy for us mere mortals, I imagine Thor getting fucked up on this in Asgard. My father only drank this beer and it’s brothers. Over time I came to appreciate and respect the demon ale. Bastard will always stand the test of time as a brewing achievement. Thank you Stone for blessing us low life’s with the nectar of the Gods. For Life!!!!

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours clear brown/red with a medium head of tan foam. Not much aroma; not particularly enticing. Taste is complex. Flinty copper metalic up front morphs into bitter hoppiness which remains on tongue. A bit of toasty, buttery malt. Alcohol is not pronounced in taste, though ABV of 7.2% A hint of smoke. Low carbonation. A bit Guinness-like, but more intense flavors. The prominent take-away is the acerbic hop bitter aftertaste. 16 oz can lasts a bit longer, obviously. Good beer to have when you're having only one.    Note: I tend toward the more citrusy, floral, refreshing qualities, like in a good IPA, so maybe I'm a little harsh on beers like strong ales. Arrogant Bastard is a good beer, just not my style.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3 Look: Clear, deep ruby with a nice off-white head of foam. A little visible carbonation.     Smell: Strong hops, with a little toffee sweetness.     Taste: Sharp hops, overpowering much of the rest of the drink with bitterness.    Mouthfeel: Average thickness and carbonation.     Overall: As usual, West Coast brewers fail to let a beer’s complexities stand alone without completely covering them in hop bitterness.

S: some slight grainy notes right off, followed by some caramel malt, very grainy, not really getting any hop aroma in the nose.  T: immediate munich, vienna and caramel malts followed by a pleasant clean bitterness, I cannot stress how grain forward this beer is, the hop profile is not; to my palate; particularly distinct however, opting for bitterness before any real flavor, though some slight piney, resinous notes do creep out as the beer opens up, along with some slight peppery flavors. I also noticed later some berry notes coming out through the malt.  M: Just the right amount of carbonation, with a medium body that feels slightly sticky.  O: This was not my first experience with this beer though it may as well have been, since it has been such a long time since I had tasted it. I have to say, I don't really like stone, and I think this is by far the best stone beer I've ever had, that being said I don't love this beer either, it's very nice, and I do quite like it, but I don't love it. It manages a real lack of personality in the hop department with a good amount of grace by having an exceptionally curated grain bill. This is definitely an important beer, and an interesting relic of another time not so long ago, that being said there is still much to enjoy here, and I for one hope that the approach of the earlier craft breweries like stone is picked back up by the younger generation soon.

I never liked this beer all that much or the tagline of "you're not worthy" or the arrogance of the description. I know, it's supposed to be Arrogant b/c of the name, but it still rubs me the wrong way, Yes, it's got a good amount of bitterness and it's in your face and it doesn't try to smooth that out in any way, but something about the approach turns me off.     That being said, I learned to like Stone much more sometime after this when their IRS and regular IPA and things like Xocoveza became available near me. Also, given some time to cool off from being deemed "Not Worthy", I can look at it with some perspective.    Can to Snifter. (4/11/18)  LOOK: dark amber. medium beige head with excellent retention.  AROMA: biscuit and vegetable; leaves, hay.   TASTE: more biscuity/crackery malt upfront; wood and sap in the finish.  FEEL: medium body; excellent carbonation.    Still not a favorite of mine, but I'll give it props for some of the perepherials as it is well crafted. It is not for the light hearted.      **   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 The only downside to this brew is the fact that I can't buy it in a six pack. Overall it's a fantastic beer and one of my favorites.

Lots of carbonation, a light pour creates a rocky tan two finger head with sticky lacing that last throughout the drink.  Smell features piney hops and a mix of caramel malt and roasted malt.  Taste starts out bitter from roasted malt and hops. The middle taste is semi-sweet malt fattened up by the abundant CO2. The taste finishes piney and spicy from the hops plus a slight alcohol astringency.  Medium rich mouthfeel, lots of CO2 with a dry finish.  Big, malty, hoppy, the label braggery is over the top and so is this beer-in a good way.

The first time I had Arrogant Bastard was in a restaurant. The large bottle was past its drink-by date. I shared it; we enjoyed it. Later I bought a six of 16 oz cans. It was so arrogant I had to have a snack with it to sooth the aftertaste. Then I forgot about it in the back of the beer fridge and this one last can, the one I reviewed above, is way past its drink-by date. It's not my favorite ale, but it's not bad. I like it better when it's aged.   I get a kick out of the arrogance statement on the can. "This is an aggressive beer. You probably won't like it...." and on for two long paragraphs. What a hoot.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 1.75 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.5 A- Pours a dark copper color with deep brown hues noted as well.....it is clear but it looks chill hazed straight out of the can. The head is caramel eggshell color in hue and the head starts about one finger in thickness, eventually settling down to a thick-ish film over the brew. The head is rather good, showcasing artwork that looks mountain like, and the carbonation is difficult to see, but with some close scrutiny, I see tight, lumbering columns of foam trickling to the top of the liquid.    S- This has characters of brown sugar, caramel and dark toffee, slight warm spice and molasses malt sweetness right up front, with balancing notes of fresh hop cones, slightly Earthy spices such as black pepper and thyme, and a raw grainy farmhouse quality. Alcohol tinges hit my nostrils with a slight ting but nothing to embarrass the brew. Rather nice overall!    T- This is intense overall, and I'm not sure what everybody is so enamored about to be honest. There is a huge blast of bitter hop immediately followed by big metallic astringency that hits all points of the palate, especially the back of the tongue. If I try really hard, I get some sort of malt character, caramel and not much else really....I find the alcohol content overbearing in this one as well......the bitterness lingers much too long and simply put it is rather off putting.    M/O- This has a medium body, full flavored with booze and hops and is a 'tad' over carbonated. I don't think this is very drinkable and I'm not on the bandwagon....sorry. I will pass on this in the future and think too much effort was put on the 'arrogance'.....I think the brewery was too full of themselves on this one.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.25 Went down pretty smooth with a pretty classic ale, if a little muted, ale smell. Reddish-brown body, a little hazy, fun packaging. The aftertaste is the only real flaw since it's dry, astringent, and more bitter than the initial taste.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.5 I thought I did this one already... turns out it was the Bourbon Barrel-Aged Arrogant Bastard, easy mistake to make as in my memory the labels looked EXACTLY THE SAME [actually there is a slight difference in them]. So here we are Arrogant Bastard! What? No I wasn’t insulting you, that’s the name of the beer... jeez, Arrogant Bastards. That was insulting you, see the difference? No, well maybe I was insulting you then. As far as American Strong Ales go this is the most popular on a little site I go to called Beer Advocate - 10,712 ratings so for, here comes #10,713! Will it be as great as Bourbon Barrel-Aged Arrogant Bastard? Only minutes will tell, around 30 to be precise.    Poured from a 473ml can into a Duvel tulip.    A: This beer is truly arrogant from the get-go: exploding right out of the can and into my sink, jeez Arrogant Bastard. Colour is a deep tawny brown, cloudy or hazed? Hard to tell, I’m gonna say hazed, with a sand-coloured head that simmers down after the initial explosion leaving a nice thin blanket, and lace. 8/10.    S: Boozy from the off, with a mix of dark fruits (prune, plum, dates) and a freight train full of molasses - this thing is as unstoppable as a train with Jon Voight riding on it. Aroma comes across with a decent amount of sugar but not a truckload, it’s not Founders Curmudgeon in that respect (my dentist BANNED me from drinking that beer when I told him a piece of my tooth broke off while I was sipping it). Pretty balanced aroma based on several scientific whiffs. 9/10.     T: Booze, booze, booze. Dark fruits (prune, plum, dates) and molasses. Much like BBAAB (as in the other Arrogant Bastard) there are woody notes throughout. Sweet mid palate, but not overbearing, bit better balanced than Curmudgeon in that respect - Curmudgeon is a bit “all aboard sugar train heading for candy mountain!”. Finish is long dry, with a medium herbal hop bitterness. Overall flavour is tasty, the booze isn’t crazy in your face, and there’s plenty going on. 8/10.    M: Definitely no Curmudgeon when it comes to mouthfeel - medium bodied with a slight creamy carbonation - had better, had worse. 7/10.    D: Yes I know Founders Curmudgeon is a different style beer but it’s the beer that most springs to mind as I sip this... I miss my Curmudgeon days (which are paradoxically behind me). I feel after drinking half a glass that the hops are a tad aggressive now (I found that in BBAAB too). Still decent though. 9/10.    Food match: “Runaway train never going back, pastrami salad is a beautiful snack”.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Classic. A good strong ale to punch you on the face with some aggressive hops. This beer was big and hoppy before today's 21 year olds were even born.

Malt aroma with a note of earthy spiciness. Sweet caramel flavors infused with a peppery zing; some alcohol tones. Heavy body; coarse on the palate; relatively dry finish.    Over all these years I have no recollection of trying this beer. Regardless, it definitely has a strong, malt-forward character with a boozy quality. Old school and very appealing...

Smells faintly of biscuity, caramel malts, toffee and red berries, with a hint of pine. Taste follows the nose, with a firm, slightly sweet and caramelly malt presence backed up by bitter, piney hops. Hints of chocolate, toffee, red berries and citrus. This is an expertly crafted and balanced amber ale that has great complexity without sacrificing drinkability. The balance between sweet malts and bitter, piney hops is exceptional with some nice layers of fruitiness and slight chocolate and toffee notes inbetween.

I am very pleasantly surprised with ABA overall and it actually shattered my expectations. This ale is definitely on my top 10 list of market ales to try because it is extremely tasty and satisfying. Now with the bad reviews I feel a lot of people expect more of a nut ale or brown ale taste to this similar to like a Samuel Smith. This ale actually has a pretty high hop content to it and its closer to an IPA than something like Sam Smith or Newcastle. If you don't like hops then I recommend staying away from this particular ale. All in all I give it a 4.5 and its something I would definitely drink again.

A beautiful beer.    A: Substantial earthy nose, with a strong malt and caramel presence, along with a some floral hops.    T/F: Smooth malt, caramel and chocolate up front along with some sweetness, and followed with an aggressive hop bite at the end along with a hint of the alcohol content. Medium body, dry finish.    O: Very tasty beer. It has the look and aroma of an amber ale, with a taste that combines the best of ambers and IPAs.

Fades slowly and leaves behind lacing that coats my glass. Aroma is very earthy and piney from the hops then mellows into a sweeter caramel malt. Flavor starts bitter, very earthy and woody, some caramel in the middle. Hints of citrus and piney bitter finish similar to a hoppy barleywine. Feel is medium with good carbonation and a dry finish. I was hoping for a bit more malt, but it is enjoyable.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 I was at the end of my rope with my day, so I picked up a big bottle of this to take to the face.  I was supposed to have band practice, but after driving all the way out to the storage space, NO ONE showed up!  On top of that, the code for the gate wouldn't work, so I had to drive right through the thing. Luckily it was just a 2x4, so my 2000 Nissan 200SX took care of that no problem. I was at my boiling point. I called all the guys on their home phones - no answer (of course!), so I left a message. Then I tried sending them all a text message - no reply. Then I sent each of them an email to let them know to check their voicemail and read their texts - crickets.  It wasn't a total loss at least, as I was able to fire up the space heater and get some song writing done on Old Faithful. I guess you could say I have a songwriter in me, dudes. And once I got this Strong Ale in me, things really took off. I wrote a pretty F'n sweet tune! It sounds like a love song, but it's really about playing video games.  Anyway, I have always liked this beer - especially the name. You know what I'm sayin? You know what I mean?

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Overall a decent beer. Drinking from a Belgian chalice from a canned beer. Pleasant beer finish isn't too strong head dissipated  Quickly nice malty texture and flavor. Hop taste isn't too strong. Reminds me a little of wheat beer without the banana taste, here it's closer to a prune flavor. Would drink again but would run out to get them.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Though you are not at all told, this is an amber ale. Lots of heavier (caramel/chocolate/black?) malt, dark color, a classic looking winter beer.   And that's absolutely great.....if you knew what you were buying. Which this brewery does not help do in any way....other than to overtly insult you into thinking you're an idiot for anything less than loving it.  Well eff y'all.   I liked it, just don''t appreciate being bullied into what to think. How's that for 'arrogant'? There are lots of good amber ales out there....and IMO, this is nothing special enough to create a brewery over, even if it does make for a good website tale.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This is a very interesting beer! Deep color, leaning more toward a red ale...caramel? Very sweet note upon first taste, ending with a bitter hoppy aftertaste, like an IPA does. I'd pair this with red meats - steak, roastbeef sandwiches (beef on a weck) and burgers with really sharp cheddar cheeses. Quite impressive.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Amazing. Simply amazing. The only thing average about this ale is the colour—semi-dark. But all else—wow. Smells great, everything you would expect from a strong beer; malt, hops, slight fruity aroma, etc. The taste is on par with the Trappist beers—no way you would be able to discern that it packs 7.2 % alcohol. Such a shame that it is available all over Central Europe with Czechia being the sole exception.

I then quickly got into British, Irish, and German beers and forgot all about this one. Last night my girlfriend bought it for me on a recommendation of a mutual friend who knows what sort of beers I liked. I was amused to see it, so I cracked the top off, gave it a sniff, you could really smell the hops as well as caramel, slight hint of toffee, as well as some darker notes. As soon as I put the bottle to my lips and tasted the sweet bread it was exactly the way beers are meant to be, room temp and bitter is better. I instantly loved it and drank the pint happily, I'm def going to check out their other beers as well. If you want a beer the way beer should be than this is def it.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Arrogant Bastard Ale brewed by Arrogant Brewing, with an ABV of 7.20% This American Strong Ale pours out a deep, deep golden amber color with a nice off white head. There is a lot of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich, with grassy grains and malts. You also pick up a nice mild hop bitterness, in the smell. Now for the taste, it is bold with flavors. You first pick up on a hop bitterness, then grassy grains and malts. The hop bitterness is a nice note to this brew. There is a lot going on in Arrogant Bastard Ale, it is bold with flavors. The body of this brew is a medium to heavy, but not to heavy. This Strong Ale has a lot going on in it, there is a real nice balance to it. There is nothing overpowering about this brew. It is really hard to pick up on 7.20% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth. The mouth feel of Arrogant Bastard Ale is Bold, Hops, Clean, Smooth, and Refreshing. Overall I'm giving Arrogant Bastard Ale a 4.50 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the chance to. If you are looking for a bold tasting brew look this brew up. Arrogant Brewing, did a real super nice job with this one.

And one of the very best strong ales anywhere is their Arrogant Bastard Ale. The Bastard pours a thick head of tan that resembles light caramel that stays around a long time - really nice. Colour is a dark caramel like a well-aged congnac only hazier. Nose has (again) caramel, burnt sugar. The smokiness hides some of the floral notes, but it's there. And I detect a little bit of apple (granny smith?) that gives it a tiny bit of cider. Taste strong malt representation: It's smokey, dark caramel covered on a biscuit. Not much of a coffee nor chocolate as one might expect from a beer like this, but there is something of the two that was roasted in the process. Hops of floral and pine notes, woodsy like autumn. When drinking it starts off refined with a good carbonation to remind you that this is not a brandy, it's a strong American ale; It remains strong upon the finish, but gives the drinker a bit of a break by going down easier. OK, now I detect some chocolate on the finish. Man, this beer is so good! this ain't no Budweiser, this ain't no Coors, this ain't no fooling around. This is what beer ought to be and for people who know and appreciate drinking the good stuff. Highly recommended.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 I appreciate the message from this beer. "Perhaps you're mouthing your words as you read this." Great stuff. Message sent to those who think "cold" is a taste. A problem I suppose is that this message has already been sent. Repeatedly. Within the BA community at least, I don't think most reading this need to hear that message. And while it does have a nice bold taste, there are so many choices out there now for beers which taste better than this one.  Anyway, the beer pours a beautiful reddish-brown colour with tall offwhite-orange head with good retention & lacing.   You can just see how creamy this beer is going to taste. It is for the most part transparent, but in holding it up to the light I see a fairly fine uniform particulate. Not fine enough to call the beer cloudy, but too small to be floaters. This beer has a heavy sugary bready malt aroma and taste. The odour also includes a dominant sour fruit smell; plum I'd say. It's in the taste as well but it wouldn't be quite right to use the word sour for the taste as there are so many sour beers out there now which are truly sour. There is a nice creamy mouthfeel which leads up to the bitter clean ending of this beer. Overall I just don't think I would seek this beer out again but if you're one who wants a big malt taste and aren't into IPAs or any of the other styles which go beyond malt forward, you may like this beer more than I do.

L: Deep mahogany that is murky, two finger light beige head that is super fluffy, outstanding retention. Spectacular lacing.     S: Smells of pine hops, alcohol and rich bready malt.     T: Lot more malt on the palate, lots of caramel and toffee, grainy too, dark toasted ones, some good pine hops, alcohol is present yet not overbearing. Very complex.     F: Medium body, smooth and creamy, prickly carbonation. Grainy dry finish.     O: Stone is one of those breweries like Founders that can't seem to release a bad beer (yes I know it's happened but super rare). Really excellent brew.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 16 oz can into a glass.    This is an excellent-looking beer. Dark, reddish-amber with a perfect tan foamy head. It just looks like a good beer, and all that that entails. Not beautiful, but ruggedly handsome.    Aromas of hops and toasted grains are very forward, with just a hint of ester-y banana and a touch of booze in the background. Very aggressive bitter aromas, with the roasted and malted ones taking a bit of a backseat. Well-balanced, yet in your face.     The flavor is a study in amazing balance between a variety of disparate, and prominent notes. Whereas the nose featured more bitterness, the palate is assaulted on the front end with a healthy dose of diacetyl and cocoa sweetness, followed by toasted grain, and finished with some strong, yet judicious hoppy bitterness. The hops are strong, but far short of an IPA, lending a citrusy, but not quite piney quality that is just about perfect.     The mouthfeel is down the middle medium, but it is definitely a dry finish, helped along by the hops and booze that arrive at the finish. Neither cloyingly sweet nor overwhelmingly bitter.     I've passed on this cocky offering a myriad of times, for whatever reason. Maybe I thought the name and the description on the label seemed "gimmicky." Not so upon finally tasting this. It defies categorization. It has the malty sweetness of a dark ale, mixed with a hoppy, but not "hop head" crispness that keeps me coming back for more. Kudos to this brewer for combining so many strong aspects into one cohesive, cocky brew. I dare you to drink just one.

Initial impression is roasted malts and a hint of caramel, but very subtle. Medium mouthfeel -a lot thinner than I expected. Carbonation is medium. Finish is slightly bitter. Overall, an interesting but not particularly compelling take on the style.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 An arrogant brew indeed. A deep dark red ale with attitude. There was no aroma, no scent when opened. At least nothing that I could ascertain. It had a thin creamy light-brown head when poured, making it look inviting. I consider this a cross between an ale and a stout or a stout-ale hybrid; and certainly nothing wrong with that for that is what makes it a bastard in the first place. As for taste the taste lingered and overall feel was quite good. I also like that it was a full pint at the price of it 12 ounce cousins, making it a real good value for an amazing ale. I will be having more of these.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Taste: rich, smooth, malty, roasted flavors balance well with just the right amount of hops for this style. Mildly spice malt nose. Deep mahogany/copper hue, mostly clear, with a tan head and some lace. Medium/full body. Very drinkable.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Pours a copper brown into a fifteen ounce glass mug the same temperature as the beer. Two fingers of tannish head that lasts before settling to a creamy rime. Beautiful lacing.    Nose is fairly mild but very complex. An unusual blend of piney hops and sweet caramel malts make for an interesting brew. Some dark fruits. Maybe raisin and plum? Very dry hop finish but still leaves a sweet lingering caramel aftertaste. Very complex brew. Also very hard to describe. My guess is either you will like it or despise it. Too thin on the palate.    Overall a very complex beer with the citrus hops (pineapple) and the sweetish caramel malts. Although the brewers maintain a good balance it just isn't my style.

L: Pours a brownish red, nice and clear. Fluffy 2 inch head - not white, but rather with a reddish tint.    S: Hoppy. What really surprises me is the smell of the malt - very toasty?    T: This is a great beer - after all the run-of-the-mill pale ales and all their derivations, I was surprised by the toasty malt bill with hops; great bitterness    F: Love the dry! Slight juicy up front, destroyed by the dryness!    O: Awesome ale!

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 After all this time finally getting to this brew. Deep brown with a tan froth. Tea, caramel and big pine to the nose.

Lingering floral hoppy notes. Great complexity.   Coffee and toffee are the high notes.   Malty finish.   Raspberry hints in the nose.  Spicy alcohol scent.  Mmmm. So fun to drink.

First one of these in 10 years (?) and still very enjoyable.

Still, this beer is a pioneer in the Strong Ale category, and will always be world-class.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 On vacation and bought this ($5.99) thinking it would be a nice accompaniment to a steak dinner. Sat down to eat and cracked it open, only to later look at the bottle and notice a best before date: 7/10/14... Almost three years past. Oh boy, here we go.    Pours a dark Amber with a full off-white head. Leaves a nearly unperturbed sheet of lacing all the way down the glass. Smell is very sweet, sticky and syrupy, lots and lots of malt and no detectable hop aroma. Taste follows suit; very sweet malt flavors, slightly dry, little to no hops. Slight bitterness at the tail end, faint hint of booze but not overpowering by any means. Carbonstion is very light and leaves a nice coating on the mouth, not unpleasant.     Reminds me of some Barleywine ales I have had. Overall glad I tried it and surprisingly am not dissatisfied, however I may have some trouble finishing the entire bottle myself.

However, I am trying my hardest to judge unbiased because I review for myself, and like to rate accordingly.    The beer obviously has a lot of ingredients in it. It's got a high ABV and it's made by a well known brewer. The name is also super catchy. This is a recipe for a great rating. It's a good beer, if I could only have one beer for the night.    If I want to throw back a couple, it can become a bit much. It's bitter. It's strong. It's blunt. It tastes like all all the other imperial beers were thrown into a mason jar and you took a swig. I think this is a good thing?    I will continue buying this beer because of social proof / herd mentality and also because I think I like it. It's got flavor. I wish it had flavor and smoothness. It's not smooth. It doesn't have a really complex yeast profile either which would be awesome if it did. Lots of malts, lots of carbonation, and lots of hops.

Lovely dark amber colour with generous foamy head that leaves copious lacing on the glass. Sweet malty smell. Assertive dry, tart hop taste giving way to the malty sweetness.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 What you get here is hops. Intensive hops. Tremendous multitude of hops, mostly bittering hops. A wide variety of damn bitter hops.

This is the penultimate bitter, arrogantly overwhelming, bastard, bastard, bastard of an ale!  Nothing will be the same anymore.

Taste - Bitter pine, caramel, toasted malt flavor, light raisin or prune, slight citrus, caustic, finish is sweet and sour with aggressive bitterness, like chewing on aspirin or tylenol. All over the place on the palate, such a weird mix of flavors.  Feel - Medium bodied, sticky, slightly oily, lively carbonation, finishes on the drier side.    Overall - There's a lot I like and a lot I don't like. The malt and fruit flavors are pleasant, but the hops seem out of place to me. Bitterness lingers on way too long and becomes tedious. Not my kind of beer.

This is my first from the brewery and I'm definitely curious to see what else they can do. Good for a pint if you see it somewhere.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 An old school Ale, not for the faint-hearted. I poured one into the glass to observe its look, but the rest, I drank it right out of 12oz. can. Highly recommended.

It surprises me that people focus on the hoppiness of this beer when what struck me the most was malt, malt, malt. Heavy malt backbone of toasted caramel, a bit syrupy. The hops certainly provide a nice opposition to the malt with a bitterness and some dankness that in the end makes for a great balance. Body is rich and full, mouth coating. Remains balanced in the finish, leaving a lingering bitterness and sweetness at the same time. Definitely enjoyable.

Overall not bad, but it looks great! I got a 3 finger thick tan foamy head that sat on top like a memory foam pillow. Otherwise it poured a clear reddish brown that let light through. It smelled malty and sweet, roasted malts and caramel maybe. In the mouth it is medium bodied with low carbonation. Bitter front to back and finished with some hops and that bitter aftertaste that I usually like with grilled venison or beef. The flavor and aroma are so strong I had a hard time picking out individual notes.    I will have a bottle on hand for my next time I grill some steaks.

I have found beers that rate better, but I am a loyal and true "Arrogant Bastard". It looks bold with a nice arrogant head, smells somewhat sharp & fruity at the same time, taste smooth yet hardy, feel is smooth and ful-filling on the palate. Get away from the yellow beer and be a bastard!

Held to the light, a nice ruby with a thin, persistent head and lively bubbles. Easy on the eyes.     The sent of malty pine. (Pine tends to dominate)    Feel/Taste ... follows the nose, with added fruity aftertaste. Sharp and pungent, sour and tangy. Proud and defiant. Beyond aggressive. After several gulps, a lingering malty goodness at the top of the throat, and serious Lemon on the mouth's roof.     Other fruits there may be, but I have been enjoying Lemon slices a great deal as of late. I was warned ahead of time about this ultra busy brew, and waited for the right time to savor it. Certainly not my regular cup of tea, to say the least, but this is quality stuff ... Now back to Guinness (& other Stouts) !

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Poured to a tulip glass.    A: The body is copper with some hints of red when the lights comes through. The head is beige showing some good retention and medium lacing.  S: The aroma has some toffee in hit and big backbone of malt. You can also find alcohol in this aroma which isn't that great but generally speaking it's cool though.  T: There's a giant malty touch with a generous yeast profile. You can also taste the toffee and the spiciness of this beer. Like cinnamon and some peppers I guess. The roastiness of the malt also provides a coffee-like basis for the whole flavours to show themselves.  M: The body is medium high. Carbonation is medium to medium low but perfect for the style. Bitterness is medium high.  O: I've had better from Arrogant Bastard, specially Double Bastard. But the historical power of this beer is all over the glass. You understand why this beer was so important to the craft beer revolution just by looking to the glass and having a sip.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 This beer is beautiful to look at. The darkest red (pretty much ruby) I have seen in a beer. The flavor was great but very strong. Hops, hops, hops, bitterness, along with some chocolate and roastiness on top of the hops.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A - Dark brown color, not pitch black. Poured into a pint glass. Good frothy light brown head. Slightly transparent and can see my fingertips behind the glass.    S - Definitely has a grain smell effect. Not too much going on with the smell other than hints of hops and malt.     T - Aftertaste is subtly bitter, but easy to drink in moderation. Little bit of a buzz on the tip of the tongue after every sip.     M - Tastes chewy, similar to a Guinness. Satisfying every sip, not too alcoholic. Slight creamy feel due to the heaviness of the beer.    O- Overall, this is an exceptional beer that I can recommend.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Wow! Big head thstbdissapent. Strong fruity smell, get a whif of alcohol. Super rich and malty....fruity taste....I'm thinking of dark fruit, plum and prune taste. Crisp balancing bitter finish with only a slight but pleasant aftertaste. Can taste the alcohol a bit, but it is pallet cleansing. For a strong beer, it seems like I could drink a few of these.....goes down very easy.     The is beer has the right to be arrogant.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 16 ounce can into a snifter. The color is a dark red with a light tan head. The smell is very citrusy. The taste is a heavy grapefruit hoppy taste with bitter aftertones. Very different from any " ale " that I've ever tried. I've been drinking this for a few years and it's a love it or hate it type of beer. I love it!

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 1.5 | feel: 2 | overall: 2 Let me begin by saying I like strong ales, barley wines, Ipa's, dIpa's, imperial stouts . It's not like I'm a bud drinker or afraid of a 11 percent beer. The first 6 pack I bought when I turned 21 was Bigfoot. That was just over 10 years ago.    Anyways, this beer is gross. It does not deserve anywhere near a 90. Ironically I am now the person the bottle says the brewery is not trying to please, but I feel o have a respectable palette and they simply are wrong. Their beer sucks.    The beer is thick and chewy. Like, imperial stout chewy but in a bad way. I choked down the 6 pack before I left this review in the hopes my pallet was off a couple nights. Nope, I simply think this beer is downright bad. The hops are all wrong, the body is like a barley wine gone bad, and basically nothing about this beer works for me.    Anyways, I won't be long winded, I just won't be buying this beer again. There are many better strong ales out there. Try one of them instead of this.

The appearance is a lovely reddish hue with a thickish head that soon thins out, leaving reasonable lacing in its wake. The aroma hints at a US IPA and a UK strong ale and the taste delivers both at first. However, the hops then kick in and crank the beer up to a higher level. The finish is wonderful, with sweetness and resin lurking on the tongue.

Mostly citric and bitter hops, with a hint of pine resin, burnt sugar, and quinine. Even for the hophead this might be too much... definitely was for me. Not enough flavor balance. Good mouthfeel and carbonation, though.    72/100

Lots of bubbles rising, and a tan, creamy head that lingers forever. Thick lacing hugs the glass. The aroma is dark dried fruit...cherry, raisin, a little bit of woodiness, and lots of crusty bread. Flavor again lots of dark dried fruit, a little brown sugar, and a sweet breadiness up front. That is taken over by a nice bitter bite, and they kind of play off of each other. The feel is medium full body, average carbonation, drying on the finish, but a little slick for most of the sip. Overall, quite an interesting, tasty brew.

Overall I disagree with the statement of "you're not going to like it" I find it delicious. It sort've fits many beer genres too: IPA, sour, scotch ale, strong ale, winter ale, and malt bev. Just delicious!

L: Pours a clear reddish copper color. 2.5 fingers of foamy off-white head. Gorgeous lacing.    S: Rich malts and vicious hops. Grains.. .a bit of booze.    T/F: Rich and malty up front... sharp... caramel and grains which gives way to some palate wrecking hop bitterness on the back end. Sticky and carbonated in mouthfeel... and surprisingly smooth. Warming but it hides the ABV. The finish is dry.    O: A classic... and just one of the finest beers available. This is one that changed how I both look at/drink beer. Still amazing today, and as the can says... not at all New and impossible to Improve. Arrogant... and deservedly so.

Still had to do so, because it was just that damn good...    Into an IPA glass, the bastard poured almost clear cordovan with very thick creamy and supple tan head. Persists long with sticky lacing that enhances the experience nearly to the bottom of a glass nursed for nearly 30 minutes.    In the nose, there's vanilla with a drizzle of butterscotch fairly early. It's sweet and then starts to turn to fruitiness, but never quite unleashing the citrus, pineapple, or evergreen of big hops. You can tell they are there, and a bit of orange blossom squeezes through to make that clear. But the aroma is complex with many layers, not allowing any essence to dominate. It's remarkable, but somehow a tiny bit of a letdown at the same time.    Over the teeth, the first sensation is of fruit; then almost scorched earth and toasted campfire coffee usher in a dry midsection that allows the hops to emerge. It's just bready enough to contain the bitterness and let you chew the grapefruit pith and pineapple that are stained with dark berry and kissed with white pepper. Persistent bitterness from hops dwells to give it a different sort of length. Too bitter for some, it seems, but I think it's malty backbone contains the bittering to make it absolutely compelling to taste more.    The body is just above medium with silky smooth mouthfeel and lively crisp carbonation. It tastes juicier than it feels in a way that is unexpected. Not problematic, but somehow I thought more squishy oils were coming, and then the soul of a Belgian poured out of this American Strong Man... Perhaps he really is a bastard.    Certainly, he is entitled to be arrogant. Overall, the blend of creativity and classic craftsmanship is superior.I can't believe it took me this long to try such a well-known brew. Now I'm begging for more.

This is a true stone classic! One of the reasons I love stone brewing...nuff said    I've had many of these beers before but chose to review a can from Stone's Berlin Brewery that I recently visited.     0.5 l can poured into a snifter.  Pours a beautiful dark maroon (almost a purplish brown color).  Distinct smell, very complex and hard to explain, almost like funky cough medicine.  Taste is very malty with a hoppy bitterness that's unlike an IPA, complex flavors as you let the beer warm up, very enjoyable.  Overall this has always been a go to beer for me. I like to sneak this in my rotation once every 3-4 months to change things up a bit. Long live the bastard!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 L: Pours out a ruddy amber color that looks a bit darker in the glass. Clear, with plenty of rising carbonation, topped by a big, pillowy beige head with near-perfect retention, and tons of lacing.    S: Aggressive piney hops; pine resin, earth, some herbaceous spices like clove and fennel. Backed by a massive malt backbone that is equal parts sweet and roasty. There's a sugar, caramel/toffee candy side, and then an acrid, baking cocoa and black coffee side.    T: The sweetness hits you upfront. You get lots of a caramel and toffee, which then transitions down the roasty side of malt spectrum. You get dark chocolate and dark roast coffee then. As soon as the roast hits you, so do the hops, bringing earthiness, massive pine, and clove/fennel. The malts disappear completely into a dry finish, bringing an aftertaste that is exceedingly bitter, just lingering forever of intense hoppiness. The pine sap, earth, clove/fennel, and even coffee roast lingers forever on your palate, punishing you for many long minutes until the next sip.    F: Medium-bodied, well-carbonated, full and smooth on the palate with gratuitous amounts of malt sugars and absurd hop oils.    O: Not quite an IPA, not quite a barleywine, not quite an amber ale, this unique beer still stands for what it is: an ARROGANT BASTARD ale. Not for the faint of heart or palate.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Big, big malt and a generous hop finish. Pretty nicely balanced and does a good job of accommodating 7.2% alcohol. Drinkable, but not for the faint of heart either.    Pours the colour of dark tea with a reddish hue. Hazy. Moderate head settles to a long lived full film and gives up a steady run of spidery lace throughout. Lots of malt up front. Burned toffee, dark fruit. Sweetness is immediately offset by a pretty substantial dose of bitter and drying hops. The difference between the front end and the back end of the brew is striking. Lingering fruit. Yup, lots of alcohol, but not at all boozy, so prepare to have this sneak up on you.    Tasty, but not for the faint of heart. This is a beer with a rather big presence.

Taste is malt with burnt fruit, molasses and caramel with hints of citrus and pine, almost IPA-like with stronger hops and some hints of a heavier English brown ale. Very smooth aftertaste, bitter but not overpowering. This went down well with a salty hot pretzel. Definitely lives up to the hype.

look: 2 | smell: 1 | taste: 1 | feel: 3 | overall: 1 This beer tastes like a bad home brew. Unbalanced, overly bitter, and nasty tasting in general. Just because you throw a bunch of ingredients into a beer doesn't make it good. I like hoppy beers, but there are too many bittering hops here. The burnt hop aroma is unappealing. If there is anything wrong with the American craft beer industry, this is it.

What the smell portends as its customarily solid, Redwood-like IPA loses its resonance almost immediately and unleashes instant cottonmouth. Better as it warms, but astringency prevails. The feel, follows suit. Perhaps not a good can, but almost certainly not as good a beer as when it flew under the Stone banner and was bottled. As a Midwest-based Stone fan who also recently enjoyed a 12-sampler featuring Ruination, IPA, and Citrusy Wit, and one who previously ranked this beer as among his top 5 overall, I am disappointed and would need a great pour at a bar to convince me to try this version again.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 After paying to have an inanimate can chastise me, I don't regret the purchase. Pours deep red as the blood of countless enemies slain since this beverage first placed beclawed toe upon this earth. Smells is huge amounts of dark berry, rasp and black and the like, with a little bit of that oatmealy grist scent like walking by a brewery's mash tun early in the morning. Tastes like pepper and bread crust, the exact mouthful I would hope for when drinking a beer that claims to stand atop the peak of Ale Mountain. With an ABV that won't ruin the familiar craft beer drinker, I could see myself having more than one of these. Well done, you snarky, egotistical pint, you.

T: Toasted malt, a bit nutty, sourdough, hops come in strong, lots of grapefruit zest and pith, pine, peppery, hints of dark fruit, and a touch of toffee sweetness.

Taste is like a Bigfoot Ale light, its that big brawny brown hop monster. Definitely obliterates any fizzy yellow beers in its path. It kind of defies classification. Its definitely hopped like a double ipa, but the malt bill is somewhere between imperial brown ale/porter/barleywine. Its real malty, real hoppy, ain't no skimpin on ingredients here.

Has a dark chestnut color with ruby highlights and a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, malts, light hops. Taste is malts, hops, pepper, dark fruits, light alcohol, not nearly as bitter as I expected. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good beer, but it didn't live up to the hype.

But, Lord, are there bittering additions. This lands firmly in the early 2000s “bitter is better” school of hop bombs; it actually comes across way hotter than the ABV because your taste buds are hyper-sensitized. It settles into itself, and reveals darker malt notes - a huge Premium Bitter or a less juicy American Amber, maybe - though in avoiding being overly sweet (a touch of chocolate rather than a ton of crystal?), it actually comes out a bit thin. Lagunitas does this kind of thing, but are a whole lot more fun with it. Still all about the naked IBUs, which just come across today as… unrefined.     A Gatling gun: deadly and dated. 4

I get citrus in among the malt, bitter, dry sweet/bitter aftertaste. Chewy feel, booze just enough to let you know to treat it with respect.

Not seriously getting any strong hop aroma. Reminds me of a brown ale.   Taste: Super bitter. Yet, not bitter like an IPA, it's more complex. You can pick out almost porter like dark malts and dried fruit in between the harsh bitterness.   Mouth: The hops linger on the tongue. I can't really get anything else from here.    Overall: This beer was a top 10 favorite of my fathers', and I was very excited to try the beer based on that alone. After seeing the brewery post "unworthy wednesdays" where they posted quotes of people who said AB was "too hoppy", I had to try it. Being an experienced IPA drinker, the bitterness wasn't a problem for me at all. Rather, the balance between the complex malt and chinook hops was welcoming. This would pair well with some fish tacos!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 650ml bottle poured into a sniffer.    Clear reddish brown hue with very thick creamy and velvety tan head, the head has exceptional retention and just slowly subsides to everlasting foamy crown while yields plenty of refined yet sticky lacing along the glass-side.    Caramel, vanilla, roasted coffee bean, toasted dark bread, chocolate, sugar, faint honey, some fresh fruitiness , overall the aroma is complex with many layers yet not too sharp and quite aromatic.    Start with fruitiness that is reminiscent of dark fruits and citrus, roasted and toasted profiles reminding of burnt wood, smoky, coffee, and chocolate thereafter exhibit bringing a dryness and astringency for complexity sake. Hops also lend a touch of peppery in the middle where same time malts provide a big caramelized sweetness and breadiness to keep the tempo of flavor in balance. Persistent bitterness from hops dwells at the end also lingering as a long tail of pleasant aftertaste along with a toasted and roasted traits that come back to together dominate with hops at the ultimate point.    The body is medium with silky smooth mouthfeel and lively crisp carbonation sweeping through the palate, very dry finish.    This beer is aggressive, arrogant, complex, no compromise, yet very tasty and hard to resist. Am I worthy? I don’t know but the beer itself is more than worthy.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 Pretty meh for the style. I really prefer the Lagunitas version of an American strong Ale in the form of an Investigation Shut Down. I think that the hops have been muted, and the malt is killed. Stone seems to think this is the next best thing to sliced bread according to their description on the can, but I cannot agree. Although the biggest redeeming quality is 6 twelve oz cans for under $13, the flavor and overall enjoyability is lacking. Probably wouldn't purchase again. I am looking for so much more with this one!

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured from the iconic gargoyle bottle into a tulip, this beer is a deep brown with a reddish hue. The head was ample - at least a couple fingers - tan color and persistent until well after the last swallow. Great cling to the glass. This is a visually appealing beer on all accounts - beauty in a glass.    Aroma - maybe I expected more, but it seemed a bit weak. Vaguely citrus/resin, sweet and bread-like, brown sugar leaning toward molasses.    The taste is the "ah ha" moment. Starts off pretty sweet with the malt dominating, then a smooth transition to a hoppy character followed by a retrained yet ample kick of bitter. The taste washes over the tongue in a continuum. I get some grapefruit peel, and an almost cedar-like resin quality that washes over the malt sweetness. Maybe a little nutty flavor chips in. As it warmed, the beer became a little more flat for me - the profile sort of mellowed out and the flavors seemed more muted. Maybe let it get a bit too warm though.    Feel - creamy, dry, a bit sticky on the lips. Carbonation moderate, medium bodied. Not a palate shredder.    The beer is beautiful to look at, I felt a slight letdown with the smell, but the taste is so interesting in how it evolves. Nothing dominates, the different flavors take turns - hard to describe, but there is definitely an initial, middle, and late taste to this beer with no arguments - just substitution. The bitter lingers a bit, but that just invites me back for another round of sweetness on the sip. I guess it has to be called something, so an American String Ale is as good as anything - certainly broad enough to capture what's going down with the beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 16oz tallboy can into a tulip glass. Color is dark brown, like a cola. Thick, off-white foamy head several fingers thick. Aroma is heavy on the malt. Taste is bitter, a little hops leading right into a heavy dose of malt flavor. Finish is dry and bitter, lingers for a bit at first but as you work your way through it doesn't seem to stay too long. Overall a nice ale that seems to well deserve it's reputation as one of the better ales out there.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a glass. Bottled on 03/03/16. Simply outstanding!    What else can you say about Arrogant Bastard? It's a beer I always come back to because it's delicious every time. Looks good, smells good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one....     If you see this on the shelf, buy it. You will not be disappointed.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Solid, solid stuff, not near as menacing as they'd lead you to believe, instead this in the hoppy [darker] red [IPA]. Nose of dark malt, almost a hint of chocolate, some earthy hops too, not a huge presence of dry hopping or anything. Palate is a nice mix of bitter earthy + grapefruit hops alongside some sweetened malt, really pleasing bitterness levels, maybe a little astringent but not necessarily to its detriment. I dunno, this is one of those brews that just work, and its continued to place in the craft beer pantheon, now 20 years running, is deserved indeed.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.75 Poured from 24 oz bottle into standard nonic pint glass, Pours a beautiful brown with slight amber streaks with a really nice foamy tan head.   Smell is a wonderful mix of strong hops and malt, a perfect balance.  Taste is just as good as the smell, with a strong hop at the beginning with a nice tasty malt middle and a small bitter dry finish. Absolutely wonderful.  Mouthfeel can be a little bit soapy but other than that it goes down smooth. You can kinda feel the booze with some sips if you leave it in your mouth a little longer.  Overall, This is definitely one of the best beers I've had so far. It's worthy of the hype, and I will have this again.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 22oz bottle served cold into a tulip. Enjoy By 4/14/16, so I'm a little late to this party, but fairly certain that this will still be good. This is one of those American classics... a beer that has been around for a long while (in craft terms anyway) and while others may have surpassed it, it is still brilliant and a beer that every advocate should venture a try.    Appearance - Dark and ominous, a muddy brown color is poured with mahogany and red highlights depending on the light. A small half finger of yellowy-tan head, which recedes fairly quickly leaving a little puff of film on top. Did I mention hazy?    Smell - This is well... different. Some fairly potent hop presence, although more of the earthy and pine resin variety, but there's also a floral component too. On the malt side, the grain is hidden and there's a little booze but i'm also picking up molasses, making this sort of like a hoppy-doppelbock but an ale instead of lager. Hence the American Strong Ale classification.    Taste - Initially quite bitter with and earthy and grapefruit rind type of flavor, just plain bitter. Some middling sweetness momentarily than a rush of booze kicks in. This definitely feels like a stronger beer. Finishes with a little black coffee and more earthy bitterness. Interesting and not quite my pint of beer, but unique in that I can't say I've had anything quite like this. Leather possibly?    Mouthfeel - Carbonation is modest, body is reasonably light all things considered with just enough stickiness to make it interesting. I like it a lot.    Overall - Arrogant Bastard Ale lives up to its reputation as one fine tasty beer, that's got a few things going on that don't normally seem to work (molasses and earthy hops), but they come together to form a unique beer that is quite enjoyable. Would love to procure a fresher sample for comparative purposes, but if it's this good after 4 months, it certainly has eared it's reputation. A must-try for any beer advocate.

Much to my surprise I actually enjoyed this brew, impressive given its price of five bucks for a bomber.    Look: This is a pretty beer. Dark red with hints of amber around the edges, and a respectable tan head.    Smell: Like a slightly sweet rye bread. Misleading given how much flavor it has.    Taste: Grain and malt come in first, followed eventually by a bittersweet finish. More complicated than I have come to expect from many ales.    Feel: Starts out smooth, goes grainy in the middle, finishes smooth.    Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. It's a tasty and affordable brew available in most places with a beer store.

I am happy for them. But, all these hops are not for me and detract from this brew's crafty blending of malts that I quickly sense are there... but the hops never let this be a fair fight.    Listed/reviewed in the book "1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die", Arrogant Bastard probably should be there to represent the west coast iconoclastic, entrepreneurial brewer that typified the second generation of American crafters. But, Arrogant Bastard would not be in my book.

A classic ale look    S: Hoppy with some fine hints of caramel and baked bread    T: A classic ale taste with a bit of hoppy bitterness on the back end. Make sure you try to let the head break down before drinking as the more foam you get per sip, the hoppier/bitter is the flavor of the ale.    F: very similar to your typical ale. Good carbonation but not too fizzy. Not overtly thick or thin.    O: I'm not with the norm that loves a ton of hop flavor and bitterness of their beer so while I enjoyed this ale, I'd probably go with less IBU ales. That said, this ale is a nice vacation from the norm that will appeal to both the standard beer drinker and the hop head as well.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 This was the first beer I reviewed on here, when my journey into the realm of craft brewing was young. Three years later, I am back, and I am re-writing my review.    This beer looks beautiful. I did not have the most appropriate glassware on hand, so it went into a standard shaker pint. Still, it was a dark ale color, a satisfying redish-brown. Poured from a 22oz bottle, it developed a light tan head that left nice lacing at first, but dissipated relatively quickly when compared to other beers I appreciate as much as this one.     It smells well balanced. I detect both the malts and the hops in equal proportion, but personally find it difficult to distinguish if the hops are more fruity or floral. One thing is for sure, I do not detect a pine aroma, and that doesn't show up later either. As the beer warmed, the alcohol made an appearance in the aroma of the beer, and it was very welcome to the party.    My palate is a bit rusty at the time of tasting, but the caramel hops are there for anyone to see. It finishes with the hops, and it is just as bitter as a solid IPA. There are much more flavors in there, but I am off my game right now. I will have to come back a third time. The finish seems to have a bit of dryness to it, and I think I detect that because of the contrast between rich caramel malts and the strong hop presence at the end.    The mouthfeel is also exquisite, having a light carbonation that allows the beer to still feel as though it has a heavy body, while tantalizing the taste buds with the buzz of carbonation.    I am a very big fan of this beer. It is one of the first that really awakened in me a desire to understand craft beer, and it continues to be an excellent brew, available nationwide (USA based reviewer), for a great price. If it is not a beer you have had, I urge you to change that. You will come back for more.

Taste: A bitter taste that left my mouth feeling a caramel effect.    Feel: Over the course of this drink I feel that it's a smooth drink that goes down the hatch quickly and that this drink is worth your interest!    Overall: I'd trade or buy more of this beverage with a smile on my face.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Sampled from a tulip glass at the San Diego Airport (Stone Brewing at Terminal 2)  Appearance: Brownish-red color with about 2 fingers of white foamy head.  Smell: Strong aroma from hops are easily detected. A more subtle mix of fruits is also noticed.  Taste: Similar to smell. Strong bitterness from the hops that is well balanced by the sweetness of malts. Mildly bitter aftertaste that is not uncommon to strong ales and IPAs.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Goes down smoothly.  Overall: Stone Brewing rarely makes a beer that isn't enjoyable. This one surely does not disappoint, and I highly recommend this tasty strong ale.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Served in a snifter, it pours a beautiful clear copper with ruby glare, with a one-finger ecru head, foamy, with good retention.   Easy to form head again after a swirl, you can see it is really carbonated. It also leaves a very good lacing.    The aroma is very intense as you can sense it without getting too close to the glass.  Very hoppy bouquet. You get notes that you would expect in an IPA or IIPA. Tropical fruits as in passion fruit, tangerine and melon. Earthy hop aroma too, caramel, and slight butterscotch. Very unique.     The flavor follows the nose.  Upfront the sweet notes of the fruits and caramel and some tamed bitterness, but quickly the earthy hoppiness and the butterscotch gain prevalence and transform into pure bitterness. A boozy note underlies the whole flavor and it almost gives it a vinous quality, and a malty sweetness comes through as well. A roasted character is also perceived.  The aftertaste is long and mostly that of caramel and earthy bitterness.   Oily mouthfeel, full body, very smooth, nice carbonation.    A complex and Sui géneris beer.   Scrumptious.

But it's a stretch to cal it remarkable. The smell isn't overpowering, and it goes down very smooth for a beer over 7% ABV. However the taste just isn't there for me. I found it to be boring and bland. Overall a good beer but I would not call it world class.

Not quite as impressive looking as I had hoped but it still is pretty unique and I can't think of any other beer that quite looks like this one. Smell is intriguing. A lot of sweet and malt based flavors come through: caramelized brown sugar, toasted bread, some dark fruits, etc. But there's also a definite hop oil type aroma to it. Lots of complex roasted, caramel, and earthy flavors that develop all throughout the palate. The bitterness slowly comes in and is strongest right on the finish. Feel is full and rich, some alcohol is noticeable and gives a warming feel. Finishes dry, leaves a lingering bitter aftertaste. Surprisingly easy to drink, I didn't struggle at all to finish the whole 22 oz and came out feeling pleasantly buzzed! I was very impressed with how balanced the flavors were and how surprisingly delicate and complex some of the flavors were. Will definitely drink again.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Overall, a fine and satisfying beer. Nicely balanced, it hits all the right notes from beginning to end. A bit low gravity for my usual taste, but good enough for me to see that the advantage here is that I can manage the whole big bottle without (much) impairment. One I will definitely do again!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bottle dated 1/07/16, and enjoy by 4/06/16. Upon opening bottle a unique intense hop/malt rush met my nose that quickly subdued to the air, especially after being poured. Translucent copper beer with a fluffy head consisting solely of micro bubbles. Immediate lacing all around the glass, sudsy-est lacing I've ever seen.    Smell after pour consists mostly of pale and roasted malts with a little bit of bitter hops. Taste is pretty much exactly on point with the smell, but is just oh so refreshing. Bitterness becomes apparent in the semi-dry finish, starting a vicious cycle of rinse, repeat until the whole pint and 6 ozs is finished. Did I mention I have work in a couple hours? LOL.    Reading the history of the beer, it seems like an industry standard of sorts, and I can see why. I definitely can respect and enjoy the shit out of this beer regardless if its not my favorite type of ale or concoction. It is in a league of its own, I think.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 I just had a bottle while walking in the woods, didn't really look at it, but the taste and feel are just outstanding. Remarkable that such a strong flavor can be so well rounded and balanced. Great lingering aftertaste. If you're only having one beer and you want a lot of beer, this is it. I had some of the Oaked version and it's maybe even better.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A - Nice clear reddish brown color with an off-white head, that sticks and leaves great lacing.   S - nice nutty and chocolate malts balanced out by a American grapefruit hop profile.   T - nice grapefruit and pine happiness balanced by a good chocolate and caramel malt backbone. Reminds me of a toned down American barleywine.  M - drinkable, medium mouthfeel, alcohol covered, aftertaste is grapefruit hops and nutty malts.   O - good beer, I don't know if this is really 93 worthy. Nice bitter taste, complex, but an entry level craft beer if you ask me. I do like the Bastard boxes and Oaked version of this better.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 I was surprised to read on the distinctively Stone Brewing bottle "Arrogant Bastard Brewing." Whatever the organizational structure, I've always enjoyed Stone for their aggressive and bold approach to brewing. I'm not always in the mood for a beer that takes itself so seriously, but this bomber of stiff brew hits the spot after a long week.    Iconic screen printed bottles are a nice touch. This beer pours an opaque dark red with lots of browns in my snifter. It takes some extra agitation to coax an off white head that fades to a thin bubbly slick. Not the prettiest beer, but it has a unique look.     Smells are hoppy and boozy. I'd never guess this is "only" 7.2 ABV. They say smell is the sense most linked to our memory, and this reminds me of some of the barley wines I've had. Flavored also remind me of a hoppy American style barley wine. Lots of malts that toe the line between caramel and dark roast with mostly citric, lemon-rind hops.     Feel is slick and full, with a long bitter finish. Not the kind of brew you forget what it tastes like after the last swig--the flavor sticks around a long time. For this reason it could easily overwhelm a food pairing.     Overall, I'm really enjoying the aggression because I drank it when I knew it's what I wanted. Very well crafted and a break from the norm.

Perfect blend of hops and malt, dark but not stout, strong but not too strong.    If I had to drink one beer only for the rest of my life, this would be it.    Seems like one of those "either love it or you hate it" sort of beers. I'm okay with that - you don't have to love it, but I do.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 Arrogant Bastard pours a rich plumb color, with a thin slightly off-white head, which leaves behind a fancy ring of lace. It smells like dark fruit, with a little bit of nuttiness. It sure has a strong, bitter taste. A nutty mild flavor opens up before it finishes a bit fruity. The feel is rather pleasant. It feels strong and robust, and yet isn't harsh to drink. Overall, meh. I know this beer has a large following, but I'm not a fan. Sure, I'm glad I tried it, but the harsh bitter/hoppy taste really drives me away.     Served in a 12oz snifter.

Leaves a pretty good lace on the glass. The taste is carmel and nutty with a sort of burnt flavor. It has a somewhat bitter finish, but I find all the Stone beers have that. I like the feel of this one a lot, it has a nice foamy sensation. I find myself picking up one of these every few months.

Smells of slight hoppiness, generic sweetness, a small alcohol scent, with a slight nuttiness. Taste is superior to the smell, initial malty sweetness fades into a slight charred/smoky flavor which leads into a semi-dry bitter/herbal taste with a lingering nuttiness. It's quite different but tasty! Feel is slightly watery though it isn't off putting. The charred/nutty flavor coats the mouth and lingers. Overall this is an interesting beer that is strong yet tasty and easy to drink.

It gets better as I drink more but it's like going from bad to decent at best.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 I can't believe I have not yet reviewed this timeless classic, so here goes:  Amazing and dynamic pour! Coming out of the bottle it looks like a medium to light copper, however, once in the glass it looks like a lovely combination of brown, mahogany and ruby red. A big foam head tops things off as does a frothy and sticky lace that retains throughout.  Very pleasing on the nose. The dark fruits hit me first and remind me of strawberry jam. I also smell citrus hops. Also, throughout there is a bready and biscuity malt aroma.  The taste is truly dynamic and complex. It is initially sweet on the tongue like dark fruit and caramel malts. However, a big hops flavor and bittering soon envelops the mouth, making it almost IPA like. In the hops there is some citric grapefruit like zest along with pine. The finish alternates between dry and sweet fruit. Overall, the bitterness is moderate to high but with excellent malt balance. The alcohol is barely felt.  The mouthfeel is truly amazing. I would describe it as medium bodied and dangerously drinkable. Unbelievably smooth and almost creamy. The carbonation is just about perfect; soft but with some tingling on the tongue.  This is one of the best beers out there. It is absolutely delicious and one of my all time favorites.

Smells of hops hops hops. I was surprised because while I was pouring it, I thought for sure it was going to be a malt bomb.    Tasting it wow, I think this is the first beer I can recall where you get hit with both the malt and the hops right up front and at the same time. The malt fades but the hops linger on the tongue. This beer has remarkable balance.    Great lacing too, every layer remains after each sip.  Mouth feel isnt too thin, isnt too thick.    I think I found one of my Go-To-Beers.

Smells of well balanced hops and caramel malt as well as what seems like a dozen other aromas. Hops hang out in the top of the mouth but I'm not complaining. Great mouthfeel. Not overly piney or citrusy like alot of West coast ales. Very enjoyable. Prost!

Not as much head as I guessed reading some of the other reviews - but this doesn't affect the mouthfeel & carbonation which is just right. Great taste - touch of malt, touch of stickiness at the beginning, great hops on the back end without being overpowering.   This is a very drinkable beer, a solid choice any time you're in the mood for this style.

Aroma is dark malt & dark toasty bread, fruitcake, caramel, floral & resinous pine hops. Taste is heavy dark pumpernickel, fruitcake, fig, prune, molasses, toffee, pine, some alcohol, starts bittersweet, with increasing bitterness, finishing dry & bitter with a lasting bitter, dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is moderate-heavy bodied, medium carbonation, silky, creamy, nicely chewy, a little prickly from mid-sip through dry finish with a moderate astringency in the aftertaste.

So many flavors and notes going on that I struggled to identify much of anything in particular. Sometimes that can be a bad thing...but not this time. Not with this beer. I thoroughly enjoyed it.    Medium bodied, and in some ways, perhaps the only thing close to a shortcoming. I think I would have preferred it to be slightly thicker. Maybe not. Perhaps I'm just being an arrogant bastard.    Overall, a great beer. The 22 oz. bomber did me for the evening. I couldn't imagine drinking another beer after I finished the bomber. I didn't want to spoil it!

I get great citrus in spots as well. Some may say overly complex but read the label. Like most strong beers it may take a second glance to get the gis but damn, pretty tasty.

Retention & lacing are both above-average.    S: Cedar, brown sugar, some resinous hops, hints of macerated fruit. Pitted fruit as well, date being the most apparent. Vanilla is subtle but evident.    T: Comes on with a decidedly bitter hop note that leans toward pine & resin. This develops into a very evolved malt character on the mid palate, featuring bready notes along with dense, heavy spice - think clove & nutmeg. The bitterness increases throughout, but is tempered by a resurgence of slightly more citrus-leaning hop tones along with brown sugar & molasses. The finish is a remarkably-balanced mix of biscuit & bitter hop. Altogether, very deep & well-executed.    M: Moderate carb married to a mid-weight malty body. Finishes surprisingly light & a bit slick.    O: Just fantastic.

S - Toasted caramel malt aroma, a little grainy, some citrus, and a touch of oak woodiness (very slight).    T - Nice toasted caramel malt throughout morphs into a very hop forward, biting and long lingering piney/citrus finish that wipes all the sweet malt right off the tongue.    M - Full medium body, slippery, somewhat sticky on the lips, dry finish, somewhat creamy in the body.    O - Been a long time since I last had this one, still enjoyable.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 She pours a dark brown and leaves the same colored body with a soft lumpy creamy looking half finger head. The head lasted about a good three minutes. The lacing was mild in that there wasn’t any rings or any foamy leftovers. The smell has mainly the hops in front through a nice without better words "arrogant" bitter sort of way. Some malts appear in the background as she warms. The taste has a mild bitterness backed up by some citrus and hops. On the palate, she’s about a medium sort of body and comes across somewhat surprisingly smooth. Still, there’s a decent sort of sessionable aspect to it. Overall, this is a decent beer, nothing to scream about. I guess I just thought it would’ve been better but hey I’d still have it again.

This is actually one a friend of mine recommended to me when I first started to lose my craft beer virginity, and this is as good as it gets. Drinking the full 1 pt bottle as I type this, almost done, with such a strong ale, high abv at 7.2% it tastes miraculous. Its sweet, perfectly balanced bitter, a sort of tinge of grapefruit, awesomely delicious. Just drink this beer, drink it till' the bottle goes dry.

Head that wouldn't go away. Lacing all down the glass.   Smell - Some breadiness, molasses, hops. Caramel sugars.  Taste - Wow! Malt to hops ... neither overpowers. Sweet fades to bitter.   Feel - Rich and creamy. Coats the tongue to let the hop finish linger.  Overall - I finally get the fuss. This is a huge beer and it does not disappoint. Puts the "strong" in strong ale. Gives you everything you want in a beer.

Not in-your-face, but all there. The taste builds and lingers. Each time that I've had this beer, I like it better than the last. Arrogant? It ain't braggin' if you can do it. Stone backs it up, and stands alone again. It's a beer that makes you appreciate Stone even more. 7.2% ABV

The taste is a perfect blend of bitter hops, mild grapefruit, and malty sweet molasses. As it warms the brown sugar/molasses-like sweetness comes out more. It feels smooth and creamy, with medium carbonation and body. This is a truly satisfying, bitter but sweet, work of art in a bottle.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 My first review  I recently started drinking beer again (after a long hiatus on the wagon) my first beers were all on tap: Guinness, Youngs Double Chocolate Stout, Belhaven Scottish Ale, and Stella. My past was all mass produced garbage. Anyway I liked these so much I started trying whatever craft stuff I could get my hands on. I've tried a lot of bourbon barrel aged stuff (it's okay) and IPAs (NOT a fan - chick beer) but the brass tax of the matter is this: if you like a good (non-barrel aged) stout or porter, but aren't a fan of the crazy critrus bitterness of IPAs AND used to like (crap) mass produced beer, this is your beer. I love it.  I am glad it only comes in 22oz (cause I'd get hammered) and sad I rarely find it on tap (which has a more plumb taste on the front end).  I highly recommend reading the back of the bottle because it is FACT. Tried this first at Flagler Fish Company out of a growler in June 2015. Been in love ever since

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 This is no pale ale. This is Arrogant Ale. Arrogant or confident? Is the difference whether you live up to it? Perhaps this ale is more confident than arrogant, since it lives up to the extravagant billing.    The color is a deep reddish brown. The head foams up without restraint and retains, leaving a lot of lacing down the glass.    The smell is neither overly fruity nor overly piney. It's simply right. This is an extravagantly hopped ale, but it's been hopped with the right hops! I'm looking at you Samuel Adams Hoppy Red. There's none of the stanky hops found in Sierra Nevada's Flipside or Hoppy Red. It's a delightful aroma blending fruit, pine, spice and ale.    With Arrogant Bastard Ale, the wildly extravagant hops are balanced by the extravagant malt. Nothing is out of proportion here. The hops bring the fruit, pine and spice with the requisite bite, but it's never unpleasantly flavored or oily feeling. (I'm looking at you Sculpin IPA.) The malt is powerful and stands up to the hops. The result is a balanced, very fully flavored ale. Yes, the ale is somewhat demanding but it's never unpleasant.     The malt has plenty of character and body. The feel is of a powerful, full-bodied ale.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Beautiful dark brown with a thick viscous dark tan head. Pretty good head retention as well. Slight murkiness. Smelled slightly mineral with a dark brown sugar sweetness. Taste start off with a light steel and mineral flavor but quickly turns earthy and malty. Dark roasted grains and minor molasses and coffee notes added a tich body through the midsection. A sharp dry bittering finishes the the beer. After getting into the second half of the 22oz bottle? The rich earthiness dry texture turned to more acrid dirtiness. What once stood out as the best quality to me slowly morphed into the Achilles heel. Maybe chalk it up to being an aggressive beer, but it built and built and ended up more than I wanted after 22 ounces. The feel is dry and slightly grain and sandy. Overal this is a great unique beer. A nice change of pace from the run of the mill ipa.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Opened a bomber straight from the fridge and it fizzed over. Poured a great looking, dark, reddish body with a huge, tan head. Head was thick and creamy. This is a really good looking beer. Smell didn't hit too strong... light maple, and something roasted. Taste was not what I expected. It's like a stout, thrown into a Boston Lager, and chased with a hop bomb.     The carbonation kept a nice, thin head until the end of the glass, but it wasn't prickly on the tongue. Tasted smooth and thick. I swear i caught a chocolate covered cherry at the beginning of the sip, then caramel roasted malt, and on to a heavy, bitter hop taste. Aftertaste was a little too tart on the tongue, but besides that you wouldn't guess at the abv.     Stayed away from stone for a Long time. The bottles turned me off and looked a little too gimmicky... something I would have seen way back in my fraternity days just sitting on someone's shelf for decoration. Bombers were on sale so I gave it a try. Glad I did. I'll definitely be back to pick up a few more.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Appearance - pours amber with small head that disappears quickly. Presence of astringency with lacing that does not hold. Cloudy. Aroma - smells of vanilla. Taste - mild sweetness that has a bitter lasting aftertaste. Touch - feels fresh with some astringency. Overall - would recommend. Easy to drink and the mild astringency compliments the flavours well. Does not feel like a 8% beer.

I could definitely taste the hops which were quality but it seemed to sweet and lacking much fizz. I'm thinking I got a bad bottle and willing to try again but first time was highly dissapointing.

I hate to give 5s but I'm almost tempted. Deep, semi-clear mahogany in color. Not all light gets thru, but most. Pours with a beautiful 3/4 inch tight bubbly head that clears fairly quickly to a thin layer. I seriously wish i could stain my floors with this beer  Smell:Caramel and bread. Very slight pine and floral, but no distinct hop aroma considering how bitter this beer is  Taste: Very bitter, very bready, reminds me of bread crust. Was expecting maybe more toffee/caramel flavors but i really didn't get any.   Feel: Low to medium carb. More watery mouthfeel than i would've liked  Overall: Don't really drink a lot of american strongs, so i don't have much to compare it to, but an overall pretty enjoyable beer. I'll certainly pick this up again at some point when i feel like a variety pack or if its the best thing on tap somewhere i go but i don't see myself really seeking it out individually

The taste reflects the small, with a lot of malt and hop flavor. A very subtle caramel/chocolate flavor in the aftertaste, otherwise the malt and hops dominate.     Great body with very mild carbonation. Just to my taste.     Overall a really good beer, which I'll gladly have in the future. Even though it's not the type of beer that pushes the frontier of brewing.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 A - from bottle (at LCBO) bb of sept 3. Dark mahogany brown with a really full initial head and good retention and film. Sticks around quite awhile and beer itself is quite clear and has a nice ruby hue.    S - rich aromas of sappy piney hops, sticky caramel malt, nutty, treacle fudge, maple syrup, all overlayed with really pungent hoppy aromas, lemons, strong florals.    T - fairly big body with lots of interesting malt flavours, munich malts and caramel, maple syrup, bready and slight roasty and nutty. Also a lot of really robust hop character, pine resin, florals, lots of aggressive hi-alpha hops, rich dried fruit cake, with raisin and prune notes. Finishing with a nice dry bitter finish.    F - nice initial prickle of carbonation, quite a smooth body with some malty sweetness and growing bitterness, finishes long with a substantial body.    Quite a well done and balanced ale. Interesting interplay between the competing malt and hop flavours, aroma is quite aromatic, while the taste I feel falls off a bit. Still this one was a nice treat.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 2 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 2.75 A : Cherry-mahogany colored body with 80% opacity. The head is giant and popcorn yellow, with tons of IPA-like lacing left behind as it recedes slowly. Initial measurement is at 3 fingers. Simply stunning.     S : Some armpit-like smells, some aged mahogany, faint nut and cellared fruit. Definitely a cousin of the IPA from the aroma.    T : A robust roasted maltiness out front, followed by a fresh slap of wet hop, mixed with grapefruit rind and lemon rind, and then...metallic diarrhea. The finish is slightly smokey but tastes like a blended sweat sock and crushed aluminum pop cans. That finish is...well, it kills the beer. But the more I drink it the better it gets?    F : Dense, substantial, creamy...with moderate carbonation underneath and a dry finish.     O : An interesting tryout, although I wish I could have bought a smaller bottle. I can respect it, but that finish is pretty awful.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 SRM 17-20 (deep rich copper) clear with a modest creamy off-white head that lasts, while dispensing a fine coating of lace on a Cisco fisheye pint glass.    A good balance of caramel and pine resin with earthiness and dried hay in the background.    Quite bitter through and through as expected. Caramel mixes with pinesap and grapefruit. This one lacks layers of complexity and is best at proper temperature. The finish is long and tasty.    A medium body with creamy texture punctuated by modest carbonation and light astringency. Alcohol is as expected.    This is an iconic and certainly enjoyable beer. However, it has never been, for me, a standout as the hype would lead one to believe. I find it enjoyable after a long day while talking with friends and eating fried food.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Looks deep copper with red highlights. Thick yellow foam head. Smells like american hops, citric, pineapple, some yellow fruits. Taste is intense, complex, malt and hops character are there and balanced, but bitterness is high. Very good beer for usual craft beer drinkers.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Purchased at the LCBO for around the $9.00 mark for a 650ml bottle. Served at 6deg C in a draught glass    A- Opens well and pours a huge light brown head that lasts forever. Very dark almost brown color. Filtered clear    S- Light character. Clove, pepper.     T- Very mild compared to the double bastard. This one is mild and easy going. Nice overall brew but mellow and subdued.     M- Average    O- Pretty good. Not a huge fan but would drink if I see it on tap. The double bastard is something completely different. I thought this one might be something like it but it's not.    Food Pairing    This nice brew went very well with....... BBQ's eggplant and zucchini. Just a touch of a glaze using soy sauce, brown sugar and olive oil to coat    Enjoy
