look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours a creamy and rocky slightly off white head. Completely clear gold color. As the head goes down, it is leaving beautiful lacing. Pouring this into the branded glass gives a lovely column of bubbles from the laser elephant etching at the bottom.     The nose is pears, bananas, oranges, a bit of pepperiness, a touch of light floral purfume when swirled.     The taste is pears, pepper, oranges, lemons, apples. Starts off a tad sweet, finishes pleasantly dry and just a touch bitter. The slightest flavor of alcohol is present throughout, but plays with the other flavors so well that it is hardly noticed.     The mouthfeel is medium bodied and soft. The carbonation is just south of high. The heat of the alcohol is noticable, but easy to forget about. A very easy beer to just keep sipping on, but the carbonation will build and warm up that alcohol a touch, telling you to slow the hell down and enjoy this beer.     Overall, this is a dangerous beer. A four pack of pint cans or a 750 mils, mixed in with some good conversation, could dissapeer faster than you'd expect. A beer everbody should try, and one of my personal gateways into craft beer.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Picked up a 16 oz single from TW Arrowhead 10-3-18 for $5.99. Canned on 8142 (5-22-18); consumed on 1-8-19. Cold stored since purchase.    Beer poured golden with a decent white head with the initial pour.    Nose is bready with hints of cloves.    Taste is bready with some tart apple and cloves. Finishes with a nice noble hop to balance the sweetness very nicely.    Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth.    Overall a very smackable beer, never had a Belgian that was as bready as this, very nice!

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 From notes 2/18/12: Pours a nice golden orange with 1.5 fingers of rapidly diminishing, white, tightly bubbled, foamy head the drops to a lasting 1/4 inch dense surface crown but leaves only a little thin lace. Aroma is pale malt, wheat, Belgian yeast, fruit, citrus, and coriander. Taste is wheat and bready malt, lemon, orange, hints of strawberry and faint acetaldehyde/green apple. It is peppery from mid-sip through the finish. Hops are detectable as a light bitterness developing in the finish but rapidly fades in the aftertaste. Alcohol is well hidden in the mouth and nose as booze but it and the ending bitterness become more evident as the brew warms.

A pleasant appropriate feel for this style  The aroma is yeast and spice forward followed by a fruity banana smell. There's a bit of malt and a little floral aroma as well .  The taste is not sweet like others in this style that I've had, actually it comes off a bit dry. The yeast and spice come through first followed by an earthy,fruity, banana taste. Mild bitter finish that lingers awhile.  Overall an excellent beer that I would try again

It pours an unexeceptional light golden color but the head poofs up as if in a defensive stature. The smell is light but full of fond memories, and laced with fresh banana, butterscotch and brown butter. The flavor is much deeper than the aroma suggests, with a gentle semi-sweetness. More butterscotch is gently layered into the flavor with additional notes of banana and vanilla. It's deep and almost unctuous, but is perked up by a light floral note, and a touch of spice. There's some clove for additional spice, perfectly positioned between the different layers. I forgot how good this beer is, and am thankful for the reminder to get a bottle of this more often.

Had poured from 25.4-oz. corked and caged bomber, from 2016, gift from a friend, into tulip. This beer is a bit rougher around the edges than I would have expected, but still a wonderfully fruity Belgian ale.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Outstanding Belgian beer. If St. John the Baptist were a brewer, this would likely be one of his creations. A pale blonde - every school boy's dream. A nice head on the brew. Fragrance is malty, not unpleasant. Taste is awesome, a little fruitiness that will get your taste buds running. Seriously, I don't understand the low ratings from other BAs. IMHO, this is one is just righteous.

F: too much carbonation and yet all the taste is on the back of the palate and is bitter and fainted yet also somehow heavy and nauseating.  O: Couldn’t even finish an 11.2 oz bottle. Only gave it over a 1.0 because of the fact that the bottle looks awesome. Save your money and buy something smoother like Duvel or try my fav category... NEIPA. Overall score 1.75/5

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This is my 2000th review, so I thought I should crack open a classic. I can't believe I haven't done this one before now....    A 330ml bottle with a BB of Oct 2020. Purchased a while back from a webshop. The label calls it a strong beer with a triple fermentation. Love the pink elephants....    A: Poured into a Duvel tulip. Bottle conditioned. A bright golden hue with intense carbonation and fine suspended sediment. Yields a large head of frothy white foam that lasts for a few minutes before subsiding to a patchy surface layer.    S: Aroma of fruity Belgian yeast with hints of esters, banana, clove, spice, phenolics, earthiness, subtle malt and a lingering sweetness. Superb.    T: Tastes of fruity yeast esters with notes of banana, clove, spice, bubblegum, phenolics, earthiness, delicate malt and faint leafiness. The booze is well hidden. Very dry, followed by a delicate bitterness upon swallowing.    M: Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and dry, with lively carbonation and excellent body. Neither too thick nor too thin. Somewhat astringent; dries the palate. Aftertaste of fruity yeast esters, banana, clove, earthiness, light malt and sweet overtones.    O: Fantastic - a superb creation that showcases the best of Belgian brewing skill. Looks great, while the aroma and flavour are an amazing mix of fruity yeast notes, earthiness and subtle malt. Lovely body. Goes down a treat - add this beer to your must-try list.

Wow this beer is amazing tasting. The 8.5% abv is completely hidden. In addition to, I like the blue color of the can with pink elephant, I think it is cute looking. This beer leaves a marvelous looking head & foam lacing as I take sips of it. I don't see too much floaties, consequently then this leads me to believe that my can is not too old. A great way to describe this beer is that it taste like your average tasting German Hefeweizen with a little bit of a sourness added to it & a tiny bit of earthy refreshing mint. The canned on version beats out the Duvel I highly recommend that you try some of this beer if you can get this in your area. Such a smooth & tasty Belgian. Cheers! A-

How do I tell him it tasted like Bud Lite soaked in his high school gym socks? How can ANYone who's tasted really great Belgian ales give this more than a 2? The aftertaste is high rear on the roof of my mouth. My tongue rejected it Someone else on this forum suggested the taste of melted plastic in a cheap beer. I think my rating is better.   No, it wasn't old.   No, it wasn't mis-treated.  The yeast that gave their lives to produce this should be embarrassed.  Minimal malt.  Questionable hops.  It tastes like something I once had in high school when a wino bought us a 6-pack for $20.  Bottom line: I will *never* have this again (unless one of my other kids gives me a bottle - in which case I'll man up and say Thank You while secretly cursing under my breath).  P.S. I wonder if my urine will smell funny after drinking this?

The flavor however is surprisingly dry, with very little in the way of sweetness and in fact there is a slight tartness paired some spiciness that resembles coriander flavors. Full bodied and with mild carbonation.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Looks like a classic Belgian Ale when poured-- golden color, white head. Smell is definitely Belgian Yeast, bread, and malt. Taste is similar but with hops, apples, and coriander at the end of the mouthful. Feel is light for such a heavy beer, and is very fizzy. No alcohol detected, and was refreshing and had a good overall feel.    This was the first Belgian Ale I have ever tried, and got me into exploring other brands/styles, so it is about time I do a review on it. Overall a good golden ale to try. Also one of the prettiest bottles I've ever seen-- so good job to Huyghe and their marketing team-- I often get remarks about this beer when I have one open at a party, like 'what is that?' or 'That's an awesome looking bottle!', especially the painted stone-colored bottle.

Overall: judging by the shape of the bottle, its eye catching however, the trunk of the elephant is down which pertains to bad luck and after I purchased the bottle I tripped on my way out of the store. This beer isn't bad but I don't think I'd buy again, I prefer natural ice. 8/10

Aroma is yeast spice, banana, clove, and mandarin orange. Flavor profile is more robust, with a sweet edge. Notes of banana, clove, orange, and dark fruits mingle with Belgian yeast spice to formulate a supple, but tasty flavor profile. Mouth feel has a little fizz to it, but is otherwise smooth, with a fine grainy texture. Overall, a lovely Belgian brew that showcases some fine Belgian yeast esters wrapped up in a flavorful, mild package.     Served in a Chimay chalice from a 375mL bottle.

Doesn't leave any lacing down the glass. The aroma is sweet and yeasty, minor alcohol, light dried fruits: green apple, apricots, and pears. The flavor is rich with those same qualities, and bready/doughy notes. The feel is very full carbonation, very dry, a little sticky on the palate, and medium body. There is a lasting, building bitterness to the brew. Overall, a little different because of the bitter bite, but nice.

Bubblegum becomes more apparent on the palette - definitely in the sweeter beer camp; mild citrus and floral notes reign things in. Likewise with mouthfeel - syrupy, but dry.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Straw golden colour (quite clear, little haze) with a full head of foam that's gone quite fast though. Still a high score for look because of the awesome bottle. Smell and taste are what you can expect from a belgian blond: yeast, orange, bubblegum, grass and malt. Mildly sweet in the mouth, mildly bitter in the somewhat short aftertaste. Medium to full-bodies mouth feel, quite creamy and smooth. Alcohol is manifest, but it blends in quite well. The entity is what you might expect from a BSPA, but this is also its Achilles heel: it's good, but a bit boring in my opinion.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Pours a rich, golden-straw color with a surprisingly quick disspaiting head that didn't retain.    Aroma is very spicy with lemon, bubblegum, and clove. Coriander and almost a lavender aroma is present. It's a bouquet of Belgian-spice aromas.    Taste matches the spice on the nose. Tons of sweet banana, clove, and bubblegum. Some lemon and light citrus notes. A clover honey-like sweetness.Mouthfeel is light on carbonation but thicker in viscosity.     Overall, this is a good good beer, but by itself it's not my favorite Belgian ale. Paired well with a diverse meat and cheese plate. It gets a 87/100.

Off white head lasts a minute and recedes to a thin ring around the glass and a few splotchy islands. Aroma is Belgian yeast and some burnt plastic notes. Taste is light malt and somewhat harsh alcohol. Mouthfeel is thin bodied, well carbonated and dry. Overall, can't tell. This one is too far gone to enjoy. Purchased warm in January and refrigerated since. Need to crack the date code before future purchases. Rated to average to revisit at a later time.

Taste: Honey whole grain crust on the attack. This fades to a highly complex body of, dried apricot, ripe pear, lightly bitter floral hops, green banana, hay, bay leaf, golden raisins, and the slightest touch of funk.     Feel: Medium bodied. Strong carbonation that at first prickles the tongue but the gives the beer a slight creaminess. Light alcohol present. Smooth with a dry finish.     Overall: World class. It's so flavor. The complexity is just so enticing to the palate. Each sip offers brings out new flavors and nuance as the beer builds. One of the best beers I've ever had.

This legend pours a lightly chill hazed golden straw color with a very nice fluffy head of white foam  that subsides to a thick ring and layer with nice lacing. Nose of Belgian yeasty goodness with touches  of light spice and sweet pale candy malts awash in a lightly peppery ester laden nose with light fruit   notes. Flavors hit the mark and exceed the nose with light white pepper and subtle apple mingling with  crisp pears and light cracker notes. Light yeast notes hit with subtle banana that is touched with light   candy sugars and then dashed with a lightly brisk herbal hop note that flows nicely into the warming   background. Exceptional mouth feel; medium body, medium high carbonation, and a lightly dry  finish.     Overall there is little more to say about this other than it is a legend and rightfully so.    Excellence from Belgium.    Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a snifter.     Cheers

Aroma: Rich fruitiness dominated by banana and pear, with a hint of green Apple and bubblegum. Like fruity candy. No real noticeable hop or malt aromas under the dominant yeast esters. Taste: Moderate grainy maltiness with banana and pear esters, giving way to a touch of apple cider vinegar and sharp solvent alcohol. Mouthfeel: Light to moderate body with a touch of creaminess, a medium carbonation, and a distinct alcohol heat. Finish: Candied pear with a slight dry bitterness Overall: A beautiful looking beer with an amazing fruity ester Belgian yeast aroma. Aroma comes through in the flavor up to the point where a harsh solvent alcohol arrives and throws off the balance. It’s a shame because there’s a world class beer here with a rough edge holding it back from being great.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I tried other Delirium's and not liked them but, I enjoy this one a great deal. Very nice gold color but a very frothy head so pour it really slow. Even when you pour it slow you're going to get a lot of head. I enjoy the ABV of 8.5% because baby, when it all comes down to it a bier has to be smooth, good tasting and have a high octane rating! That's all that matters.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This was poured into a chalice. The appearance was a slight hazy orange to amber/brown color with a half finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. There was some light lacing sticking along the glass. The smell had a nice Belgian spice (light clove/slight coriander) through some orange/lemon that seemed it was sweetened a bit like it was sugared. The taste took all of those previously mentioned elements and combined them wonderfully. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a sessionability that wanted to rear it’s face but for the most part, just didn’t. She’s a sipper and honestly I’m okay with that. Overall, if anything this beer was done very nicely to style and is pretty good to me.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 16 oz can    Pours a perfect two finger white head into my willi glass. Very creamy looking head. Body is golden in color, hues of yellow, and a little orange. A tiny bit hazy, with a boat load of carbonation. Head retention is ok so far, not amazing. Overall it looks quite nice so far.    The nose is very nice, has somewhat of a boozy astringency to it, it’s not offensive though. Certainly a sweet nose. Lots of esters, banana. A little flowery, not a hoppy flowery. Perhaps some light pilsner malt hiding underneath. It has a unique aroma to it, definitely a tiny bit different than other Belgians I’ve had, though, I don’t drink many Belgian Pale’s. I’m not crazy blown away by this, but it’s very nice.    Definitely a noticeable malt profile, most prominent I believe to be pilsner malt. A tad bready in the finish, which adds another level to the malt profile. That flowery sweetness is there, which is probably the most unique part of the beer. Esters are there, but they are not very forward at all, which is ok, but a little surprising. Astringency is there, but like in the nose, it’s acceptable. It really doesn’t have much of an offensive booze presence, just a little astringent twang. This is more of a sessionable Belgian, the esters aren’t too extreme, I assume that’s what they were going for with the style. I appreciate the balance, though I am used to something with slightly more flavor. Overall it’s definitely a very good tasting beer.    The carbonation is quite light, especially when considering the amount of bubbles I saw shooting up! The body is by no mean thin, but the lack of carbonation and overall umph does leave a little to be desired. The slight astringent kick helps make up for that a little bit. Medium sweetness lingers on the tongue. Overall it’s an ok mouthfeel, the low carbonation is a little unfortunate.    The drinkability is very high. Even though I can sense the presence of the booze, it’s not a problem. The beer is tasty, and it hides it’s ABV very well.    The appearance turned out AMAZING. Initially the head dissipated pretty fast. However, it settled at about a half finger of head for a long while, and had a substantial film for the entire time after that. The head itself was super creamy. The lacing was extremely thick from top to bottom. Great appearance.    Overall this is a very nice beer. I think I was expecting something with a little more flavor and esters, but it’s perfectly ok that it doesn’t have those things, it’s not a triple after all. Regardless, I’m not blown away, but it’s a super solid beer, tasty, with no off flavors or blemishes.

Very good head retention and lacing.    Smell: Candyish golden malt. Honeyish, floral, fruity, earthy, and lightly phenolic, mainly of clove.    Flavor: The flavor follows the aroma with bready malt, dried fruits (apricot, green raisin, some dark raisin), honey, light yeasty spice and clove, earth, and soft mineral. There's also some underlying green banana. It has a median bitterness that dries it in the finish along with the little bit of spiciness and a suggestion of alcohol, although a dollop of sweet clovey bubblegum remains on the tip of the tongue.    Feel: Light-medium in body and velvety smooth with a fine-bubbled median carbonation.    Overall: Sweetish but not sweet, complex yet not complicated, and fairly strong but not alcoholic - really well balanced, refined, and polished. Highly drinkable, and perhaps dangerously so.

Malty up front, sweetness is fairly low, fresh bread backbone, a very subtle spice adds another dimension, musty towards the finish with a soft but delicious tart aftertaste.  Feel - Velvety, fine and crisp carbonation, no alcohol noticeable, dry for the most part.    Overall - Delicious from start to finish. Wonderful stuff.

But it's good for what it is. Not really worth $7 for a bottle though.

Soft peach aroma blended with subtle hints of light, cereal malts; esters. Gentle sweetness to the flavor; banana and cloves; alcohol presence yet very tame; light biscuit taste; bitterness near the finish. Heavy but not overbearing mouthfeel; lush and velvety; slight tanginess.    This beer is what a strong ale should be like. It's not delicate per se yet certainly packs a lot of subtleties and complexities with each sip. It's boozy without harshness, it's fruity without cloying sweetness; it's heavy bodied yet comes across with a deft, almost light, warmth and succulent feel. One fine beer...

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a bottle. Had a thick whiteboard that stays for a while. Pale straw golden color.  Light smell not too strong. Smelled of light banana and almost pilsnier like malts.   Taste of strong light malt taste. Maybe some banana in there. Mostly good strong Crystal maltiness flavor.  Feel was carbonation and a little burn from the alcohol all the end. You can feel the yeasty maltiness in your nose like many great beers from Belgium.  Overall a great beer. It goes down super light compared to other Belgians but is none the less a good beer that is a enjoyed by almost anybody. Maybe why they have been around since the 1650s.

The head is small but does tend to stick around while you're getting through the quaffs.    There is a very strong floral aroma, which is at odds with the actual taste of this brew.    Just enough fizz to ignite your trap, but not too much aftertaste, actually a decent thirst quenching beverage.    8.5% is a solid strength, not over doing it, and is totally hidden (except from your breath the next morning).    Overall a very good beer, and does live up to it's cult status.

Poured into a tulip Duvel glass. Was suprised to see all 50cl easily fit the glass with a lack of a impressionable head.  Smell: Strong, but not overwhelming, sweet and fruity scent. Almost comes off as candy the more you smell it. Although identified as a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, the scent has convinced me it is a tripel.  Taste: Very consistent with smell. Touches a number of different flavors, which makes this beer so great. An initial kick of lemon citrus and candy like sweetness followed by a clean bitterness of hops and crisp carbonation. Much like it's Belgian contemporaries, it has a full bodied flavor which provides a deceptive mask over the alcohol content.  Feel: Crisp touch to mouth followed with moderate carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 A gentile pour from a distinctive 11.2 Oz faux-ceramic bottle into a Tulip. A crystal clear pale golden ale topped by a thick and pillow-y three finger tall head. Lacing is excellent.    Aromas have intense notes of sweet breads, fruit (apple, apricot, banana) along with some gentle spicy scents of coriander and white pepper.    The taste mirrors the aroma, at first, with sweet malts coming in strong up front. Rushing in behind are tart green apple and lemon zest, leading to a dry, slightly yeasty finish with a surprising zing of hop bitterness right at the end.    Mouthfeel is medium, very smooth, with mildly brisk carbonation. Alcohol is very well hidden, but this one packs a punch at 8.5% ABV.    A very well crafted Belgian Pale, DT should give those who like the style everything they could ask for. It's a bit too pricey for everyday drinking, but a good once-in-a-while treat. Just mind how that alcohol can sneak up on you, or one could find out how apt the name is.

Pours a bright and hazy golden color with a thick white head, that falls quickly, but leaves a half inch of stable head and it clings to the glass throughout. It's absolutely beautiful in the glass and almost glows when held up to the light. Smell is a tad on the weak side, but a good swirl reveals some yeasty esters, some cereal grain, and a touch of hops. Taste is much more pronounced, with that classic Belgian yeast and it's esters, a touch of fruity sweetness, with just a tad of grassy hops in the finish. Feel is medium bodied with soft carbonation, and a touch of alcohol warmth in your throat. Overall, I loved this, and I haven't a clue as to why it took me this long to try it! ALMOST as good as Duvel, which is my standard for the style.

GLASSWARE: Chimay 150th anniversary glass... centers on an impressive spiral of explosive bubbles, akin to underwater fire... its murky golden body supports a crown of thick white, creamy, even head that laces symmetrically--what isn't to like about the way this looks? smell of pineapple, peppercorn, anise, lemon zest, fresh dough, and some barnyard funk... slight phenol return as well... sips smoothly, albeit with some texture... tingles the tongue... light to medium-bodied, slightly tart at the finish.... strong pineapple, grapefruit, banana, lemon, and hay funk makes for quite a cornucopia of flavor... I have eyed this bottle for decades, only to have my uncle-in-law hand me one for Christmas....it was well worth the wait, as its dry finish elicits a pleasing reaction... great as a gift, though its price point is a bit high...

The smoke from the ceramic bottle went on and on. Lets call it nine seconds. Delightful.     Rather crisp, golden, on the verge of Ocre Yellow, with excellent carbs and an initially willowy fat cloud head, which did not last over long.     Very well balanced, with a sharp lemon aftertaste, but beware! Sneaky-strong stuff! I had it with a stick of Sweet French bread and a bit of Banana, perfect combo! Just try it, full of subtle surprises!     Back in the 90s I've had it a few times, worth the extra coin for the refined, regal, and even quirky experience!

A nice foamy white head, looks good, but does go flat after a short while…..eventually.     A small amount of lacing on the glass, not much though. Overall not a bad look.    Very, very strong smell of yeast, clove and peppers with some citrus. Certainly has a kick in the smell, very nice, and a lot going on already!! Nice, and a good start!     Can get a creamy aroma as well    Very sweet taste, not very appealing to me at all, don’t like it to be honest   That taste…….nah don’t like it  A lot of Fruits on the taste…..lemons, apples and bananas   Loads of taste, but not nice tastes from front to back  There is a strong kick after with the alcohol, can definitely feel the 8.5% which they do kindly warn you about on the label at the back…..“strong beer”, just in case you thought you accidentally picked up a lemonade by mistake!  Lots of taste, very yeasty, lots of sweet malts, the cloves, getting the cream in the mouth and the citrus    A definite slow burner   Not a fan though. If you like an all tasting beer then this is your beer, but I like my beers smooth. This is more like a Hefeweizen to me than a regular Pale Ale, but then it is a Belgian Pale Ale and I know they put all sorts of sh£t in their beers! Ha.     I am aware that this is a popular beer and considered a “classic Belgian”, and it did win a gold medal in the “World Beer Championships” in Chicago way back in the 80’s, but Crikey it did nothing for me, hard for me to stomach………….(and that’s the truth! Lol)

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3.75 Poured from the classic faux-stone single serve, foil wrapped bottle.    Look--Bright gold color. Hazy, but not cloudy, Outstanding head with solid sticky lacing throughout like a good BSPA should have.    Smell--Very malt forward. Sweet with some medicinal aromas.    Taste--Just a bit too much sweetness for me even for this style. Lacks balance. As a result the alcohol delivers some burn rather than warmth.    Mouthfeel--Excellent carbonation. Still a little too sticky without some crispness on dryness on the finish.    Overall--This BSPA hits a lot of good notes, but doesn't quite measure up to the BA score for me. I would try it again down the road to give it another try. It is just a little to cloying and medicinal.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 From notes taken 08/15/16:    Love that cork pop! 2014 bottling. Poured into large, broad wine glass, about a third of the way. Clear apple gold with peach tones, or, copper-brass. Fine and sparse haze throughout. Second pour is mirkier but still partially clear. Third is solid opaque. Fine, one finger head of lower-moderate retention, foamy/fizzy indicating effervescence, and off-white. Aroma of light, sweet and tart grains, grasses, and greens, with mild medicinal suggestions and pleasant, balanced spice notes. More vinegar/lemon character than many others in this style. Extremely spicy and tart flavor, going to have a hard time describing I think. Subdued biscuit backbone. Spicy throughout, like curry without the savoriness, or perhaps sage or cardamom or “allspice” sans cinnamon. Burning retro-olfaction from both spicy phenols and alcohol. Whatever I’m experiencing, it’s related to medicinal/band-aid qualities, I’m thinking. Tart from middle through finish, more so fruit than vinegar but not really distinct. Melds well with spicy bitterness. Could be medium or full-bodied, but extremely effervescent with abundant fine prickles so feels lighter. Warming but don’t really notice it until you’ve had “too much,” so there’s a deceptive drinkability factor.

I do have mixed opinions of Belgian beers. Some are amazing tasty, but then you get some that taste straight up like raisins, which is just blech in my opinion. This Pale Ale is exceptionally good. It reminds me of tasty yet boozier Hefeweizen. It has all of the good Hefeweizen flavors I like (banana, clove) but in a far boozier form. You do taste the alcohol somewhat but it doesn't detract from the beer at all.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from 22 oz. bottle into tulip glass. It pours a clear gold with an enormous, gelato-like snow white head and soapy lacing that didn't dissipate through the poor. It's very attractive. It's also highly carbonated with tiny bubbles rising to the top of the glass like champagne. It has a fragrant aroma of biscuit, Belgian yeast, lemon peel, coriander, pepper, and clove. The taste largely follows the nose but the pepper is more intense. There is also a nice apple taste that I didn't smell and a slight sourness at the finish. This ale is crisp and surprisingly light for its 8.5% ABV. Overall, it is a delightful Belgian Pale Ale that merits its rating of Outstanding. I think it is only slightly below Duvel. It would be perfect to sip in an outdoor cafe on a sunny day. Truly great!

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 330ml bottle into the appropriate Delirium branded tulip. Paid £2.40 for a single bottle.    Pours a clear, orange-straw coloured body with masses of intense, fine, streaming carbonation. A huge, three-finger in height, bubbly white head quickly reduces to a thin film, leaving modest amounts of soapy lace on the glass.    The fragrant nose is led upfront by plenty of spicy Belgian yeast. Dominant notes of clove and pepper float above crisp, sweet, pale malts, while soft, orchard-fruit-like esters follow. Some alcohol becomes noticeable towards the end. Taste roughly follows suit, but brings more pronounced apple and pear flavours to the front of the palate. Hints of lemon and banana, not noted in the aroma also make themselves known shortly after. Mid-palate, crisp, grainy, pale malts provide modest honeyed sweetness before spicy, grassy and earthy hop bitterness builds towards the finish. In the mouth a light body and masses of endless sparkling carbonation give a champagne-like-feel, that’s somehow creamy and crisp at the same time. Lingering clove and pepper phenols, lightly bitter hops and a touch of alcohol warmth combine to finish dry and refreshing with little to no astringency.    Overall this is an excellent beer. Hop bitterness in the finish could perhaps be slightly more delicate, and although well hidden, perceptible alcohol is more pronounced than in other examples of the style. Ultimately though these are minor flaws, and the beer remains complex, well-crafted and incredibly easy drinking. Recommended.

T - Flavor is banana and clove, a bit subdued compared to others Belgian strong ales.  M - Medium mouth feel, carbonation a little higher than average. Comes off light and refreshing in spite of its 8.5 ABV.  O - One of the classic Belgian beers, love it, I should buy it more often.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Can from New Seasons. I haven't had this beer in at least 8 years!    A clear orange with a dense, off white head with good retention and lacing. The nose is very good! Spicy, mildly bubblegum like, a little honey, coriander, clove, jasmine, grains of paradise, mildly floral, this is very good. Quite layered, quite well structured. Mild malt character, though mostly a blend of honey and grain. The palette opens mildly sweet and bubblegum like with a noticeable spicy character. Yeasty, spicy, phenolic, with a blend of white pepper, coriander, allspice, grains of paradise before the malt which is present as cotton candy, and a little honey comes thru. Mildly sweet on the finish, this beer hass a nice blend of spice and yeast, a combination that is hard to get right. Very good!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This is a beer that I've passed up for years, the pink elephant always catches my eye but I never pull the trigger. Finally decided to give it a try. Poured from a 16oz can. Clear, golden, good carbonation, solid 1/2'' head. Smell is light refreshing, possibly a hint of lemon, bubblegum esters typical from Belgian Yeasts. Taste follows, the phenol is subdued, 8.5% alcohol is well hidden, but does leave a lingering stickiness which detracts from the other refreshing qualities. Admittedly I'm not a huge fan of Belgians but this one was pretty good.

T- Spicy punch of the Belgian spices hit you right away. Perfect representation of the style with the Belgian yeasty flavors dominating the taste along with the spices. Fairly sweet and spicy.    F- Light body with lots of carbonation.    O- Excellent Belgian ale. Maybe not worth the $6 per 12 oz it goes for around here all the time, but it is a fine splurge one in a while.

But memory fails no more as Tremens finishes with interesting, peppery hops. Dry, too. (And to me, this fruit-dry transition seems very hard to do.)    Reviewed in the "1000 Beers", Delirium definitely deserves to be on the list.  Reviewed at length in "Michael Jackson's Great Beers of Belgium", he goes on at length because the character-brewers make good copy. I say that because MJ's 1999 "Guide" gives Tremens only 2 of 4 stars and calls it "goose-berry like" which, if I use my imagination, may be what pears and sour apples become to the sophisticated palate.    9/6/17 First time I've recorded my impression with food. Had Delirium with pesto and it makes average pesto much better.  6/22/18 Had again with as my go-to with pesto. Yes, still serves its function. But its alcohol does make me think that I should keep the smaller bottles as my go-to.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 This beer pours a very clear pale straw with a typically large Belgian head. The aroma is fairly mild, leading with a large does of coriander and clove, with a touch of new car smell. The flavor reminds me more of a tripel, with lots of bubblegum and clove, but the strong coriander and cumin flavors are also present. The mouthfeel is bright and very fizzy. Overall this is a remarkable beer that manages to be full flavored and very light.

Active champagne-esque bubbles and has some definitely alcohol legs.    Fresh grains, clove, slightly spicy Belgian yeast, honey sweetness, toast, light mustiness, and very floral.    Noticeable apple and pear fruitiness, with a sweet honey character, clove, white pepper yeastiness, and bready.    Light-bodied, high carbonation, soft, bubbly, creamy smooth.    Overall, a truly fantastic Belgian. For 8.5% there is no noticeable alcohol and is all around a solid brew.

Lots of tiny compact bubbles with a good layer of foam on top.     S - banana, honey, strong citrus sweetness like orange peel. Not too aromatic    T - banana and clove, but that's it. Not a whole lot of complexity. Kind of basic, but consistent. Pretty subtle    F - Light in body. Clean and crisp. Very carbonated which masks some of the taste. Little to no alcohol taste until the finish.

S - Peppery yeast, sweet light malt grain character. Banana and I think a little green apple.  T - Light sweetness, interrupted by the peppery yeast spiciness. Almost overwhelms but then settles back down. This is a balanced beer.   M - Light body, medium to high carb. Refreshing. Hides the ABV quite well.   O - This is an excellent Belgian pale ale. I am not overly familiar with the style, but they can't get much better then this.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Had this on tap at Three Monkeys in NYC before hitting Colbert. Served in a Delirium branded tulip, nice touch there.     Nothing particularly remarkable about this beer. Has the Belgian yeast aroma you would expect. Some marshmallow, some light banana, really no hop bitterness. Alcohol notes were present but in a fairly restrained way. I think you could be mistaken and gulp this beer not knowing it's over 8% ABV. The alcohol lends a certain amount of warming to the drink, which makes the fruit notes of banana and pear pop just a little bit more.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 There was a time on this site when serving style was a consideration, but no longer, to my disappointment. I just wonder how many previous reviews or hads were from a CAN. I was in Fireworks Pizza in Leesburg, VA in late-December 2015 when I spied a CAN in their cooler! I a fan of the Commonwealth of Virginia thanks to their lenient laws on the purchase of alcohol for take-away and so I got one for my very own, to be reviewed & added to The CANQuest (tm).     From the CAN: "Belgian Ale"; "Elected as Best Beer In the World!"    It had an interesting throwback rectangular tab that I was afraid was going to snap off until it suddenly gave with a loud Crack! It comes in a corked & caged bottle, suggesting bottle aging, so I assumed that the same might hold true for the CAN, requiring a gentle Glug. A swirl not only released loads of CO2 bubbles, but it also raised a finger of foamy, bone-white head with good retention. Color was Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with NE-quality clarity and so naturally, the Gelt Gang of Croesus, Midas & Mammon stopped in for a taste. Nose was at once fruity and spicy, very reminiscent of a hefeweizen with banana and clove esters, but with the musty paperiness of yeast. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was even fruitier than the nose! I still got banana, but also green apples, pears, white grapes and a real shot of heat to accompany it. Warming, it also got a light spiciness of unknown origin. Finish was bone-dry, evidence of the yeast having just gone to town during fermentation. I love the D.T.'s, I mean, Delirium Tremens! I first drank it in Pittsburgh at The Sharp Edge Beer Emporium in Shadyside & I loved it then and nothing has changed, except that they are putting it in a CAN. I would drink this on a routine basis.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Clear golden beer with a one finger high, white head.     Nose: Belgian yeast, banana, coriander, vanilla and malt.   Taste: Fruity esters, banana, apple, orange, apricot, coriander, herbs, spices and alcohol.   Mouthfeel: Medium body. High carbonation yet smooth, almost like Champagne. A light bitterness at the end. Dry ending.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Picked this beer up on a recommendation of a shopper passing by that gave it high remarks. Poured with three fingers of head, foggy yellow in look. Malty aroma, orange/banana taste. I would make a buy on this beer again as I heavily favor beer of Belgian origin...but (as I am by no range, a beer expert) I want to try this next time with someone who enjoys beer more than I do.

Taste: Initial fruity esters of pear, and apple followed by the distinctive spicy Belgium yeast flavors, ending finally with the subtle hint of alcohol bitterness. Not much going on in the hop dept. Overall very well rounded.  Finish: Highly carbonated, well rounded beer that disguises its strength very well with a sweet and fruity taste and a distinctive Belgium yeast spiciness.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Appearance - Pours relatively clear and golden yellow in color with an off-white, two-finger width head that fizzes and pops away at a fair rate, then leaves a thin, sudsy film across the surface. Not much for lacing outside a few spots here and there.    Smell - Belgian yeast dominates and gives its characteristic fruity, slightly funky banana and clove-like spice aroma here.     Taste - Follows the nose. Fruity esters hitting on apple and pear quickly give way to the predominant yeast flavors of banana and clove spice. Hints of bread and honey sweetness sit beneath. Finishes with a light, vague bitterness.     Mouthfeel - Light to medium in body with lively, bitey carbonation. Goes down easy with a drying finish.    Overall - Good, solid all-around Belgian Pale, but it may rely too much on the yeast to deliver its flavor, because there's not much else going on here. Given the choice, I'd take a Duvel every time.

OZ. bottle  Served in a tulip glass  Bottled: February 2012    This beer pours an opaque shade of amber with golden highlights. There are visible chunks of yeast floating in it, but that is due to my turning the bottle over to check for the bottling date. It was topped with three inches of off white, champagne-like head that leaves very little lacing.    I get light fruity notes of pear and peach along with spiciness from the yeast.     As with the smell I get some pear. The pear melds in with the spicy yeast flavors and a hint of alcohol for a fruit dessert flavor.     Moderate mouthfeel with a lot of carbonation    I am a big fan of this beer. I cannot believe it has taken almost seven years on this site before a review. It is a very good Belgian that has never let me down. It is typically my go to Belgian if I am unsure of what to get.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Will start by saying that this is the coolest beer bottle I've ever seen. Amber colour with a very thin head. The strong smell resembles a standard euro lager blended with gasoline. Flavour is yeasty and smooth to begin with before giving away to a bitter orange peel finish. Enjoyable enough but wouldn't drink again.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Unsure of how to rate this unusual fecund Belgian.     A: Champagne-like with a thin layer of head retention and lots of lacing     S: Primarily rotting oranges, banana, yeast, and medicinal odors     T: Starts out strange, sweet and creamy, with those ripe oranges, apricots and banana; then the peppery hops provide a bitter middle, which then blends with the sweet fertile flavors in the finale.     F: Light and bubbly, much like Champagne     O: meditation beer. savor and have some cheese.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 An outstanding beer, like a pink elephant peeing into your mouth, the ceramic bottle holds an elegant blonde ale that will knock you out, if drank too hastily. The perfect beer with a barbeque.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 A- The bottle of this one is uniquely superb to most of what I've seen on the market....who doesn't like a ceramic textured look with a stunning blue foil and pink elephant? Now the beer itself....it pours a clear-ish golden color with slight yeast suspension.....the head is impressive....two to three fingers thick and excellent retention! Carbonation is well flowing and the lacing is also excellent....    S- Fruity banana esters, with added yeasts are the dominant aromas right off the bat. Mild peppered spice is balanced by honeyed malt sweetness and hefeweizen like citrus rind smells happening...somewhat Earthy and floral as well....very nice overall!    T- Balanced and smooth define the flavors happening here.....the finish is grassy and dry...almost hay-like and Earthy tones. Citrus notes....think orange rind.... and floral tastes are present as well....peppery spice, along with cloves and wheat malt flavors are noted as well....other fruits such as banana and light anjou pear makes itself present on the palate as well.    M/O- Light/medium body and the carbonation is zingy.....very champagne like in the bubbles...wee tight! This is quite a delightful Belgian Ale with many different things happening in both aroma and flavor, of which there is plenty on both fronts.....it very much reminds me of a German style Hefeweizen in character and is actually highly drinkable. Another nice beer in my journey through the gauntlet!

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Bubbles galore settle into a frothy white head over a clear golden body. The smell is intensely spicy; cloves, nutmeg, and coriander clear your sinuses right up! Meanwhile, peach, apricot, orange, and honey add to the strong, complex aroma. The bright fruity taste encompasses all the elements found on the nose, but the balance is so good that no one particular flavor stands out above the rest. A yeasty, bready aftertaste feels a little out of place, but also provides an appreciable mellowing softness. The carbonation is high and the taste is dry, but the medium-light body is smooth and thirst quenching. A classic example of the style with a taste so delicious, it belies its ABV.   
look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a snifter. 2014 on cork.    3.0 A: Clear straw color. Two and a half finger of foamy/soapy white head. Retention is below average for the ABV and scattered wisps of lacing are left.    4.5 S: The nose instantly makes up for a lackluster appearance. Powerful peppery spiciness leads the way. Bubblegum and banana follow. Earthy citrus component - like sweet orange and lemon peel without any of the actual fruit. Hay and wildflower. Clean malts. Very nice.    4.0 T: The taste offers a new set of flavors. Lemon itself manifests. The orange and lemon peels are back, but they leans more toward bitter in the taste. Peppery spice again. Bubblegum and banana are more subtle. The earthiness is heightened though - lots more wildflower and hay. There's also some dried wood and herbalness.    4.5 M: Light to lighter medium body. Perhaps a touch more carbonation than I'd prefer. However, the carbonation is super spritzy, just like how I want in a Belgian brew.    4.25 D: Really good beer. It's a classic. Not much else needs to be said.

Leaving that aside, this is an exceptional beer. Packaged in a beautiful 750ml bottle, I picked this up in RI. Poured into a tulip glass, straw colored with 1.5 finger head with little lacing. Aroma of Belgian yeast and banana, I did not pick up the citrus noted by other reviewers but agree that the high abv is masked by the exceptional flavor. Outstanding ale.

O: This is outstanding, nice balance of spice and fruit characteristics on the nose and taste, I would like the beer to have more hay characteristics as it comes off a little sweeter than other Belgian strong pale ales I've tried, probably pick it up again.

I have had this s few times though never written a real review, so will do now.    Amazing fruity aroma. The best out of any beer I have tried. It takes fruit and beer to a new dimension...    Taste is similar to Duvel, no doubt. Possibly a bit more bitter and less fruity. Balance of fruitiness and maltiness and bitterness is very good. I love how the head and smooth fizziness stays, even after pouring. Is this better than Duvel..? Not sure, though def not as good as the limited edition triple one I recently had.     I was not a fan of the nocturnal. Some brewers are better at certain types :)    This is not the best beer ever, it needs a bit more fruitiness to truly work, I believe. Though it's very good

Banana on the end with small clove    T: banana with a bit of bread    F: tangy bite and very little carbonation. Dry alcohol which drys the mouth out.    O: love this beer, had it for the first time when I went to Beer College at World Beer Co and was really hooked. To bad the price keeps me from getting it more frequently   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Look: Pours orange / gold with a large, frothy head which dissipates fairly quickly. Slightly hazy.    Smell: Floral and fruity. Citrus, banana, and apricot predominate.    Taste: Immediately sweet like its smell, but gives way to a pleasant bitterness with smokey undertones.    Feel: Light, highly carbonated - perhaps a little too much for my liking. High alcohol content is hidden fairly well, but the warmth comes through towards the end of a serving.    Overall: One of, if not my favorite beer. Nothing I drink daily for the obvious reasons (cost, ABV), but something I'm fortunate enough to look forward to every weekend. I've been fortunate in that my local shops carry four packs of bottles and 16 oz cans as well as the 750ml bottle.

S: Belgian spices and yeast up front with candy sugar and light fruit notes of pear and apple. Sweet bready aromas come through as well.    T: Medium-light body with moderate carbonation, this beer could use a little more carbonation, but is still dangerously drinkable.    O: A classic and still one of the best BSPAs out there.

BB: 06/18    Pours slightly hazy orange, lots of soapy head, lingers well. Nice lacing.    Smell is fruity yeast...and a bit off-putting, actually.   The malts are light in heft and amount.     Taste is crisp, bubbly, light, dry, and smooth. Pretty unique profile, I like it. 'Best beer in the world' seems a tad overdone, but if you were having a particularly good evening while drinking these, you could be swayed, sure. Any easily-sessionable beer that carries an 8.5% abv deserves respect and appreciation.     I'm liking this one even more as I type the review. Nice job and well done. If wanting to sample the taste spectrum of great Belgian beers, this one has a place on the list. And at the local price (...grocery stores, not bottle shops!), I'd surely buy it again. (Heck, the packaging alone is really sumpin'!!)     I really surprised myself, especially after that first aroma....but after all, isn't that the point of all this !?   So I picked up another 4-pk with the groceries...life is indeed good.  ------------------------  PS - the Delirium Tap House on a non-descript alley in centrum Brussels is a very nice spot for a pint. Oodles of beers on tap, must stop in if you're there.

Light, crisp, fizzy. 4    A typical Belgian pale, only more so: nose headier, esters fruitier, phenols sharper, hops greener, body snappier, ABV boozier. Perfume and petrol, said a fellow panelist I judged with once, and they're not wrong - the heat + fragrance are the two defining features. But it's definitely got that Duvel, "This is sorta a lager whoops I'm trashed," drinkability going, which, given that it's also so complex, is high praise indeed. 4.25

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle to a Duvel tulip.    Look: Pours a billowing white head that has some of the best sticking power I've ever seen. Recedes into a tangle of spider webs and leaves a tantalizing trail of lace. The color is orange with a densely hazy body with the thick rich head casting a shadow upon the beer its self. Active carbonation swirls about the center of the glass adding peppered freckles to the head above. Lazy flecks of sediment are smattered across the bottom quarter of the glass.    Smell: Peppery alcohol hits my nose first followed closely by some banana, pear, and peach. A light floral zest of citrus is present at the end.    Taste: Very similar to its smell, Pepper alcohol and sweet malts hit the tongue first followed quickly by the same fruits mentioned above. The citrusy finish turns into a surprisingly hoppy bitter finale. Ripe pear and peach lingers on the tongue for a pleasant after taste.    Feel: The alcohol and carbonation work together to create a warming prickely sensation around the tongue, lower lip and upper gums. Very big body that is quick to cream up as you roll it around your mouth. The finish is very dry.    Overall: Tremens takes a very different, very successful approach than Duvel. Duvel may still be the king that I judge all others of this style against, but this is a very close second. Though, honestly, if you put a bottle of the two in front of me, I'd have a very difficult time choosing. I'd probably feign Duvel then quickly reach out and snatch both before they had time to take the other one back. There is room in my heart for both. If you haven't already, please, do yourself a favor and give this beer a shot.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 Pours a thick, crispy, off white head that lingers until the beer is gone and still hangs out awhile. Smell is light and sweet. Hay and floral notes. Mild sweetness in taste. Light malt and floral notes flavor is sweet and hard to pin down. The essence of a belgian ale perhaps. Texture is almost that of a cream soda. Smooth but rich. Overall a wonderful beer. Delights the senses and is the best of the deleriums i have tried.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Very effervescent when poured. I don't care for going thru 3 inches of foam to get to the beer. But when I finally broke thru it was meh.

Not a huge fan of Tripels, but this one is excellent with less of the banana esters I associate with the style. More well-rounded with other floral flavors that smooth out the flavor.

look: 4.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a snifter glass.    A: The body is really great. You can see throught the glass. It created a 3 finger head that after 1min was already less than half of that and that's the only reason why I'm not giving it 5 out of 5. But yet, remarkable.  S: The smell is very soft, being just undertones of hops, a very very small presence of belgian yeasts and thr rest of it is alcohol but in a good way. I find this softness a bit exaggerated and too empty for this beer. It should have a little bit more of a presence.  T: Taste-wise, it's good. It's very sweet with a drop to central european hops that are more weak in terms of IBUs but that give flavourful profile to the beer. But , yet again, as the smell goes, it misses something. You can't find a thing that strikes you as a flavor when you have Delirium.  M: In terms of mouthfeel, Delirium feels right. The enough amount of 'right' for me to give ita 4.00. The problem here is that the beer is too gasefied being more than velvety in mouth, it's almost harsh.  O: By high standards, it's a great beer, nobody can take that away. But I'm still looking to have this in a more proper way - in Belgium. :)

Small patches of lacing dot the glass.     S- Sweet Candy Sugar, Belgian yeast, and light, airy hops.     T- Sweet, jammy fruit taste upfront that fades to a lingering yet soft bitterness. Lots of Belgian yeast flavour in between.     M- Steady stream of moderate carbonation and a medium body with a nice alcoholic warmth.     O- Absolutely beautiful example of a Belgian Pale Ale and done so well that you would never know it had an ABV of 8.7%!

Bright straw color with sharp carbonation typical of a Belgian style beer. It bites the tip of the tongue nice for a refreshing rush and crisp mouth feel. The finish however, made me feel like I just ate a bowl of applesauce. I hate applesauce.

Taste of pears, green apples and a slight bit of coriander and maybe a dash of lemon zest.  Mouthfeel is of high but dry carbonation. also the soft feel of the belgian yeast is quite noticeable. lt laves slight but not unpleasant aftertaste.  What a awesome belgian strong ale that took me way too long to get around to trying. My short bullet point review does not do this beer justice in its complexity.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 As with most Belgium brewhahas the taste is on point. This a great beer that even the most hardened "I only drink Budwiser" type of person would enjoy and consider if not for it's price (as with most imported Belgium beers). Personally I think $16+ is a little absurd for a sixer of most the beers out there that are worth spending it on. Besides that I must say this beer made me consider traveling to Belgium just for beercation. Regardless of what I tell you, you shall make your own decision, but just spend the money, buy this hidden gem and prepare to be wowed.    P.s. this beer is meant to be drank from a snifter. So if you get this from some bs watering hole where the bartender only knows vodka and cranberry and miller lite on tap you're bound to have a slightly different tasteknow which glass to put it in.

T) The depth on the flavour is immense. Very fruity with orange-marmalade notes, pleasant mild bitterness at the end, bread-like yeast. Wonderfully flavourful, wonderfully balanced. Hints of red wine when you concentrate on the aftertaste. So much here.     F) Fizzy. No nasty aftertastes. One of the great achievements of this beer is that the flavours clear quite quickly, getting you ready for the next gulp; I love that in a beer.    O) This is the beer that got me into Belgians. It's still the best Belgian I have had. Like every truly great beer, it has both complexity and accessibility. Superb.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 There's a reason Huyghe Brewery is so respected, and this beer is why. I love how mainstream this beer is, because it has all the hallmarks of a great; high ABV, great fruity tastes with complex notes of sweat bread, a dark body. I've read reviews complaining about its carbonation--first, its not high, and second this is a beer you drink patiently, not an American brew that you can chug.
