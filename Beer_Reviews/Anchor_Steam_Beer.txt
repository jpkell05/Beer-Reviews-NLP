look: 4.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Aroma-  There's a slight fruitiness, but what little aroma that's present is malt forward. Virtually no hop present in the scent.     Appearance-  Lovely Crystal clear with a light Amber color, and beautiful off white head. A beautiful looking beer.     Body-  Dry, with moderate and appropriate carbonation.     Flavor-   A very slightly toasty malt that's highly attenuated, and therefore has very little if any sweetness. There is a faint yeast fruitiness that matches the aroma. It's quite understated and pleasant. All of this finishes out with a perfectly balanced amount of hop bitterness. There's also some earthy, grassy, lightly danky hop flavor typical of the northern brewer vertital.    Overall-  Very solid beer, that would be easily sessioned. It isn't wildly flavorful or outstanding, but a well made, very balanced product. It's a classic to the American craft scene, and is a beer worthy of its legend.

Great session beer. I get this on tap when I see it cause it’s rare these days

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a shaker pint.    Look - Crisp clear dark amber orange with a tall white head. Looks nice and hearty without being intimidating.    Smell - Wet grass, caramel, a weird bit of funkiness. Not complex, but it's interesting.    Taste - Not nearly as funky as the smell made me expect. A little spicy but fruity, like a chili pepper or something. At the same time, it's light and refreshing, kinda like an AAL. Nothing really sticks out to me, but it's pleasant enough and well balanced.    Feel - The thin body matches with the taste, but the carbonation is a little high for me. Gives it a fizzy Pop Rocks mouthfeel.    Overall - A fine enough beer. I can't say I've really had anything like it before, but I also don't have much to say about it.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours a medium amber, coppery coloration with a medium, frothy head. Smell is pretty subdued, with some faint doughy, caramel malt and a certain floral note coming through. Taste follows the nose, with a somewhat faint, but well balanced interplay of doughy, caramel, lightly toasted malt and grassy, floral, lightly herbal hops and mild notes of red berries. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some toasted grains lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. This kind of reminds me of an Amber Ale Light and I quite like that in a way. It may lack a strong, assertive flavor profile, but has a very nice, subtle balance to it. Very nice in an old school kinda way.

The taste is toasted malt, some hop bitterness, and a slight sweetness. The beer is light to medium bodied and the finish is dry and refreshing. I quite enjoyed this beer. In some respects it reminds me of Sam Adams’ Boston Lager.

Taste is of some caramel malts and pilsener type malts with mild hopping, kind of balanced, with an easy balanced finish.

look: 5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Poured into a pint glass Anchor Steam beer is a remarkably beautiful beer, Such clarity and with around a half inch of head that dissipates rather slowly. On the nose, I can detect some roasted malt character and a crisp, if rather neutral hop aroma. The roastyness comes through in the taste, in fact, it reminds me somewhat of a dunkel except fuller bodied(which is to say, I'd consider this beer medium bodied), with a good amount of carbonation, enough you can feel it but less than, IMO, a pilsner or something equally highly carbonated. This is followed by a crisp but short hop finish. Overall, I thought this was a good craft lager with a heavier body than found in most Lagers, which I like in this beer.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Just a good all around, balanced, easy drinking beer. The taste somewhat reminds me of some pilsners I've had, just a little bit. Good for summertime outdoor activities like barbecuing. Got this one in an Anchor variety pack, I thought I reviewed this one before but I guess not.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3.75 This is the godfather of American craft brews, you could get Steam Beer from Anchor brewery as far back as 1971 (yes the brewery has been in operation since the 1890's and Steam beer as a style goes back even further but the current recipe was re-introduced in 1971). This predates Yuengling (1987 and no I wouldn't call that a craft brew but the beer most Americans drank and brewed was so bad back then that I'd argue it did quaify then, it did help raise the bar for us), Sam Adams (1985), and even Sierra Nevada (1980). That was really the reason why I bought myself a sixpack for the Fourth of July. Turns out this is a sturdy, tasty brew. I 'd also argue its fairly unremarkable. The look is fairly attractive to me. I'm primarily an American Amber beer guy. Even though Anchor says they use a combination of pale and caramel malts, the color leans towards the caramel malt side. Plus it has a very nice, prominent, stable, well-formed head, so of course I'm a fan. The smell is fine, though unremarkable. It smells more or less like beer, malty, a bit hoppy a bit yeasty. The taste: sturdy, simple, enjoyable. though unremarkable. There is a strong (and fairly sweet) malt character balanced by hop bitterness that definitely is not excessive, though also not overly complex. They use cascade hops, but it is not hopped with anywhere near the complexity or intensity of Sierra Nevada. This is not the most interesting beer in the world, (in fact I'd rate it a bit less interesting than any of the other 3 "craft brews" I mentioned that followed it), but this is still as solid brew. Mouthfeel, I rate highly because overall this has enough oomph to let you know you are drinking beer rather than water, but its still definitely sessionable. It even though it has far more flavor and character than your typical pale macro lager, I do not think I'd have any problem knocking these back all day. It also does not get any harder to drink as it warms. Overall, I gave this a 3.75. It's good and its uniquely American, and in the dark days of mass-produced domestic garbage, Anchor were arguably the first to show us that there was a better way. If I was around to drink in the 70's its possible that I'd drink pretty much nothing but Anchor Steam Beer. But in the 2nd decade of the 21st century, a lot of other brewers and beer drinkers have learned from these pioneers. We have a ton of alternatives, many more interesting, some cheaper, some both. I could happily drink this any time, and I'll probably get it again at some point. But my 6pack was $10. Granted they do use all 2 row barley, but stil, Yuengling Traditional brewed with some barley and some corn is better imo and costs $6, and if I want to spend $10 I can get stuff like Troegs Perpetual IPA. So while I think this is a solid beer, I don't think its the best pick around for the money. I agree everyone should try it at least once though.

T: Simple but even more wonderful. Crisp and clean hops and a beautiful grapefruit tartness. What a surprise!     F: Clean with enough heft to the body to make it feel consequential. Wonderful carbonation is active on the tongue. Wonderfully refreshing with a dryness afterwards.    O: This one shocked me. I don't have much to say, because it's not much more than a simple lager, but if this isn't one of the best crafted and tasting in the style. This going to become a go-to for me.

Clean, crisp, refreshing.     Mouthfeel: fairly high carbonation that pleasantly stings the tongue. More substance than most lagers, but still very crisp almost like a Pilsner.    Overall: like everyone says: it’s a classic that stillbrates well. Drinkable anytime and with nearly any food. Refreshing but not watery. Full bodied but not heavy.

Overall, an excellent (nearly perfect!) example of this style and an easy-drinking year-round go-to beer. Highly sessionable. I can't imagine any true beer lover not really liking this beer! If I ever get to San Francisco, touring this brewery will be very high on my list of things to do.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bottle into a Kolsch glass, cause I had one. Golden brown color with moderate fisheye head, some lacing. Smell is slight malt, slight grassy hops, fairly delicate. Taste is more hop bitterness than I would expect from the smell, spice and biscut, lots of carbonation, not much hop flavor. Overall more flavorful than a larger, less Kick than a IPA, wouldn't call it sessionable, but could drink two in a sitting.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Look: Pours a clear amber with a substantial, fluffy, straw-yellow head. Solid.    Smell: Malty and sweet, a little spicy, and more hops than I expected on the nose. A real classic "beer" smell.    Taste: Clean and slightly floral upfront, resolving to a bright, spicy, malty flavor mid-palate, and finishing rich and biscuity/bready. Really excellent, and not similar to many other beers. I can understand its mass appeal based on taste alone.    Feel: I recall having some Steam poured from a tap a while ago and thinking it was rather thin, but I've just poured this one from a bottle and it feels more substantial. Either way, this is a lagerish beer, so the feel is appropriate for the type. It's highly carbonated, too, and that's really nice--the fizz makes it almost like a savory soda.    Overall: This was my first beer from Anchor, but it won't be my last! It has a lot of the qualities you get from other regional beers that have blown way up (think Fat Tire or Spotted Cow), chief among which qualities is a very pleasant drinkability coupled with enough character to retain street cred with the craft beer set. Steam is unique, it's *really* tasty, and it's now my go-to session beer. If you haven't tried one, go get it. It's out there.

It has a strong mouth feel and depth of flavor coming in at a decent 4.9%. Crisp, refreshing, dependably solid... and enjoyable - always feels like I want to have another one!

And the beer somehow makes you forget your resume is third rate, you have no connections in this sweet town, your cash is gonna run out in about 10 days and those suits in the hotel closet only make you look like a fool. This beer tastes perfect right then...33 years ago and 3,000 miles from a friend. Perfect. Anchor on Geary. I bet that bar is long gone, not the style for the jackasses who have ruined that city. That's what this beer is...

Lighter taste of light malt, caramel, dark dried fruit of raisin/prune. Floral hops really fill out the taste profile.  Appropriate medium mouth feel for the aroma/taste profiles.  Classic, solid approach to an American craft beer. A real departure from American lagers from years past, and still a treat to the present.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 From a 355ml bottle served straight from the fridge at 8 degrees Celsius into a white wine glass. Best before date: 04/2019.    Look: The beer pours a clear deep amber/light copper with 6cm of dense, tan head that dissipates into a craggy cap in 4-ish minutes. Great lacing and overall retention. Effervescent.    Smell: Moderate strength and sweet. The malt bill is layered and subtle with notes of toasty pale malts, dried fruit, and faint caramel. Fresh, herbal hops with cedar-like notes are also present, however a bit milder than I expected.    Taste: Follows the aroma with moderate strength and bitter balance. The front is malty with notes of toast, dried fruit (raisins), and light caramel. What follows is fresh, herbal hops with pronounced bitterness. The finish is very pleasant with medium intensity and length as well as a bitter balance.    Feel: Medium body with fairly mild carbonation. Creamy and leaning towards dry. No astringency or alcohol warming. Nothing unpleasant whatsoever.    Overall: The first American craft beer. I remember having it once before but I lacked the perspective and mileage to fully appreciate it back then. This brew is pleasant all around with great looks and mouthfeel as well as an aroma and flavour to hold your attention till the last sip. Quite simple yet nuanced with excellent craftsmanship. If not world-class, I still consider it a must-try for any beerlover/enthusiast.

The head recedes to a thin ring and paper thin cap. The aroma is faint and presents mostly toasted malt. The beer is barely sweet toasted malt again with a mildly fruity yeast driven finish. There is a nice drying bitterness on the finish also. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, well carbonated, and dry. Overall, very good. This bottle is past it's prime, but still enjoyable. If this beer were local and fresh, I would buy it in bulk.

A: Pours a crystal clear amber with 1 1/2 inch, off white head, solid retention and lacing.  S: Aromas of grains, dough, and pepper/spice. Honestly, more akin to a Pilsner aroma (as might be expected).  T: Light perry and caramel tastes predominate with bitterness entering early and strong at the finish.  M: Light bodied and good persistent carbonation. Clean finish  O: I remember the first time I tried Anchor Steam fondly and it has been a go to, if somewhat quirky, choice. First time I have rated it. A classic -- top of this class.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 My last bottle from the six-pack I picked up semi-recently. Mysterious code on the back is "7A8," whatever that might indicate... I can only assume it's a coded bottled-on or best-by date, but I don't know how to decode it and I'm a little more concerned with drinking and reviewing the beer at the moment rather than looking up exactly how old it is!    Everything is really nice appearance-wise -- deep golden color, bordering on the lighter orange range, and very clear with streams of little bubbles rising from the bottom. Forms a decently-sized layer of slightly off-white foam when first poured, shrinking to a thin coating within a couple minutes but staying fairly solid even then (no holes forming in it or anything just yet.)    Every bottle of this beer so far has really struck me with how fresh-smelling it is, and this is no exception. It's mild, but what's there is just a really nice bready smell with a crispness/freshness to it that's unusually noticeable even when compared to other lighter-to-medium beers that you'd expect to have that sort of feature to them. There's a bit of a hoppy thing in the background but the bready malt is the most noticeable smell right away.    The taste is also nice and bready, with a bit of a yeastiness to it that pops in and reveals its identity as not quite your standard lager after all. Very crisp and refreshing, as you'd expect going by the smell. A bit of bitterness on the end, a bit of an almost European-ish but not quite hop flavor going on, but mostly what you taste is a nice bready malt and the yeastiness that I'm guessing comes from the use of a higher fermentation temperature. The yeastiness almost takes on a quality that's somewhere between doughy and banana-y after a while. It's not a super complex beer but it is a tasty one. I recall being reminded somewhat of celery seed when I first had this beer, but I'm not getting much of that this time around. It's still very nice either way.    The feel is light, crisp, noticeably carbonated, and quite dry. Goes down pretty easily but it's not a thin, watery "chug it!" sort of beer, more one that you can either take a sip or a gulp at a time depending on how thirsty you are at the moment. I imagine people back in the 1890s way out in California would lean toward big gulps -- I bet this would be one of those beers that would be really refreshing to have cold and drink fast right after coming in from being out in the summer heat for an hour or two.    Overall, a great beer and one that I'm glad I finally got a chance to try. Try it for the historical experience of a surviving beer from the California Gold Rush, for the novelty of getting to sample an oddball beer style that you don't see around often, because the label art is really neat, or even just because you want a beer -- but it's definitely one that you should try at some point, one way or the other.

Aromas were fresh, and crisp, but being in a pub I'm sure they were overtaken. Unique and refreshing I will say.     Deep golden to light amber, slightly hazy. Inviting overall appearance and I can tell this wont last long!     Malty in a great balance between pale and caramel. Not sweet, not tart not heavy, all is just right with this classic. Perfect summer day slammer, waiting on pizzas, and also accompanies the food very well on my 2nd one.  I shall go and put many of these in my fridge, asap. Unique and about as perfect example of beer as can be found.  Exceeded my expectations and fond memories.

Some may call it "trash" because it lacks aroma, flavor and body, but when I look at this beer's attributes and think about days after fishing, playing adult league softball, and lawnmowing, this one does what one wants it to. No ifs, ands or buts, but most people in their right minds know the refreshing qualities this beer brings out. And I rarely find any beer ""refreshing," but that's often a matter of opinion.    The fact that this beer found it's way into ballparks nationwide and being able to go to many ballparks around the US and I still see this beer alongside some newer craft beer trends tells me that this beer itself will stand the test of time.  And just think you're not supporting a commercial brewer by drinking this beer. It may not be the next Heady Topper but at least most beer historians know enough to say "Thank you Fritz Maytag!"

Mildly hazed deep amber color which turns to be clear thereafter, it tops up with rich creamy off-white head that stays with good retention before slowly sinking to a long-lasting bubble sheet atop and leaving lacing wave all around.    So aromatic malty goodness ranging from toasted bread, biscuit, toffee, nutty, maybe a bit buttery, grain, as well as floral, earthy, and lightly citrus hop.    Leading by caramelized sweet malt, then grain and charred nuttiness as well as toasted bread, biscuit, and toffee bring towards the richness and dry up the palate. Citrus comes up from the hop and finish with earthy hop bitterness. Some residual sweetness together with some bitterness is lingering in the aftertaste.    Light to medium body with good lively crisp and very refreshing feel, it is quite smooth through the mouthfeel with a dry and pleasant finish.    Solid malty brew with its prominent notes of biscuit, sweet caramel, and toasted bread.

Bottle    Pours a nice yellow color, nice carbonation, with a pretty nice small off-white head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, malty, yeasty. The taste is hoppy, malty, kinda yeasty. Medium body, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Overall, a pretty tasty brew.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 The beer is a clear orange color and you can see the carbonation that leads to the thin white head. Lots of bready notes in the nose. Yeast, malts, bread, is all I get on the nose. The taste is similar to the aroma, maybe with a little sweetness at the beginning, a nice crispness, and a slight bitterness at the end. The beer has a refreshing quality to it, crisp as well as a nice feel of carbonation.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 I've heard about this beer for years now and never picked it up. I finally decided to do just that a couple days ago and I'm really excited to finally review this guy.    This beer pours a deep copper color that is clear and features light carbonation. The head is thick, frothy, white and dissipates quickly to a rocky layer with a neck. 4/5 The aroma is quite strong with both toasted and caramelized malt, providing a bit of a burnt note while also being quite sweet. There are some grassy and herbal hops that come through and a bit of Grape Nuts as the beer warms. It comes across as very similar to a Sam Adams/Vienna Lager. 4/5 The caramel and burnt sugar lead off a fairly strong flavor profile that is a bit more sweet than bitter, but overall very well balanced. The same grassy and herbal hops return here and are joined by a bit of an earthy note. Bitterness is moderate and lingers for quite some time after swallowing. 4/5 This beer is moderately drying with a light carb tickle/prickliness with the dryness lingering after swallowing for a good while. I would characterize the body as being light-medium in nature. 3.75/5 This is a really enjoyable beer to drink. It is light while retaining a very good amount of flavor. The low abv helps it to be very sessionable. More than anything I wish that I would have discovered this beer earlier. 4/5

Found this very similar to some belgian beers despitethe fact that is brewed with lager yeast. Nice aroma.    taste: pretty much the same as the aroma, with a nice bitterness bite in the end of the sip.    mouthfeel: a bit watery and soft.

There is a decent amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. I really like the look of this brew. The smell of  Anchor Steam Beer, rich and Bold with grains and malts. There is also a mild bitterness of hops in the smell of this brew. There is alot going on in this brew so far. Now for the taste, it is Rich , And Bold with Flavors. You pick up on some nice grassy grains and malts, and a mild bitterness of hops. Really well balanced brew here. The body of this brew is really nice and heavy, not saying that is a bad thing. I like how smooth this brew goes down for how heavy it is. There is nothing overpowering about this brew. The mouth feel of Anchor Steam Beer is Bold, Heavy, Rich, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I'm giving Anchor Steam Beer a 4.50 out of 5 . I would definitely look this brew up again. This is a fine drinking brew. If you are looking for something to change it up look this brew up. Anchor Brewing Company did a super nice job with this brew.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Anchor Steam Beer | Anchor Brewing Company. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this brew's head is three fingers thick and tawny, with webbed lacing, and a slightly murky brownish copper body.    I smell plenty of bread, or dare I say sourdough, malts alongside a slightly apple-y and copper scent near the end. Which I'll assume is accredited to the historical use of copper pipes at this brewery.    Tastes like pretty much the same components. Nothing bad, yet nothing outstanding either. Kinda just "meh".     The mouthfeel is medium light with mild carbonation. A clean and refreshing finish that I could see myself appreciating a lot more in the summer months.    Overall,I'll choose to rate Anchor Steam Beer | Anchor Brewing Company with a 4.25. I'm glad that I grew up drinking hard well water, otherwise I might have despised this beer. The copper taste is actually complimentary to the malts used here, IMO. Even if this might not be anyone's "whale", still grab this if available to learn some history and experience a part of bygone culture.

These breweries of a bygone era utilized pipes to transfer simmering hot wort from the kettle to a fermentation tank which resulted in steam rising to the ceiling thus giving the beer its nickname. With a light yet subtly heavy taste, this beer is great for many pedestrians making their first steps out from the pavement of watery piss onto the highway of quality beer. Whenever I pass through San Francisco I make it my mission to visit this brewery for a couple or several beer flights before hitting the road again. And really the ability to drink relatively large amounts of this tasty beer while staying cognizant enough to drive and text a friend where I had just been is one of the many great qualities of this beverage.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Unlike a lot of micros it isn’t an explosion of 1 single thing. I'm not loving the current fad of making beers that are a citrus-y explosion (can we cram even more hops into a glass of beer -- If I wanted grapefruit, I'd buy grapefruit juice, not beer).     Poured into a Pilsner glass, for me the immediate aroma is very yeasty – similar to the water/yeast mixture when I’m making home-made pizza dough. That quickly fades but it still smells nice without being overpowering. I find it to be very flavourful – almost bread-like. The hops and malt are almost perfectly balanced. Carbonation feels very light in the mouth. The bubbles are small but there are a lot of them. The carbonation leaves a mild sting in the mouth. Overall a delicious, satisfying beer.     I loved Anchor Steam when I first discovered it back in the early 90's. And today it's the brand I buy most of the time. It's nicely balanced and I respect that they're a smaller company and they just keep doing their thing without bending to any new "fad" in brewing. No disrespect to the IPAs and Double IPAs and whatnot, but those kinds of beer just aren't my thing. Anchor Steam is a "work horse" kind of beer. For what I'm looking for in a go-to beer, Anchor Steam is just about perfect.

Slight sweetness to the taste from the same bready malts, with just a hint of very muted banana, and moderate hop bitterness. Medium bodied mouthfeel with good carbonation. Almost like an amber Oktoberfest. This beer's a classic for a reason. Always happy to have this one.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I remember my parents drinking this on occasion when I was a kid (80's). I recall drinking it in my late teens as well, although at that time I drank for the sole purpose of getting drunk and never really payed much attention to taste. This being on the slightly more expensive end of the spectrum here I've passed it over alot in my adulthood. However I've recently picked it up a few times and im glad I did.    Alot of people say its got a unique taste.. but I think every beer worth its salt fits that category. This is simply a well balanced lager, perhaps on the heavier side (as lagers go) but that isn't rare among craft lagers. I suppose the brewing process does give it a slightly more fruity; ale like quality. Very slight however. It actually strikes me as a more raw Boston Lager if that makes any sense.    All that being said, its an excellent beer and is exactly the type of beer I enjoy. A full flavored, balanced lager, with subtleties and character. Highly recommended.

Smell is nutty and bready. Fresh baked dark bread aromas come through. Simple, but very nice.    Taste has flavors of bread, nuts, slight hoppy bitterness on the finish, but ever so mild. Mild sweetness throughout reminiscent of maple syrup. Very nice flavor profile, simple yet very well done.    Feel has medium carbonation, light, and drinkable.    Overall I am really impressed with this beer. Its just a simple lager, but its very drinkable and tasty. Nice example of the California Common a style that Anchor pioneered.

Tastes like dark caramelized orange citrus, dark toffee bread, toasted nutty biscuity malts, mild apple and pear, with herbal earthy floral grass and bitter pine. Feels medium bodied, creamy and smooth with low carbonation. Overall a real nice and classic California steam beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Alas, the legendary Anchor Steam Beer is available in New Brunswick!     A- Pours a clear Coppery Amber colour topped by a fluffy white 2 finger head.     S- Bread, sweet malt, and a bit of a rum-like overtone.     T- dry grain, sweet malt, and a slight bitter finish. Well balanced yet enough hop bite to keep things interesting.     M- Medium Body and moderate carbonation.     O- Top notch beer that provides a great flavour and drinkability. Nothing complex here, just a rock-solid brew.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 Not a bad lager. Flavor is a tad bitter, but not like an IPA. Color is a light amber, next to no head at all, so no foam to drink through. An ok beer, not bad, but not great. Had in a 20oz pilsner glass.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Very well balanced malt, caramel, hops. Somewhat rare for me to enjoy a beer like this w/ lower carbonation and served a little warmer than usual. I've drank this delight for years and I'm always a little disappointed not to find it on tap... If you like Sam Adams Boston Lager, you'll probably love this.

S: Not much aroma. A little bread and some malt.    T: Well balanced malt and grain flavors, with some sweet and some bitterness, but didn't notice much of a hop presence.    F: Feels light and crisp, and a little astringent at the end.    O: I really like this as a good alternative to more aggressive IPAs. It has a unique flavor, and goes down easy. At 4.9% ABV it makes for a good summer BBQ beer.

T) Dry, slightly bitter taste, malt is there but the hops bitterness is more prevalent than I remember from having this previously.

Sort of a clear amber look to it, a crisp aroma to it, with malts and some light hops. Tastes similarly crisp, with nutty and caramel notes and more bitterness to it than I expected. Feel was pretty carbonated, with probably contributed to the crispness I was getting. Overall this beer went great with the Dungeness crab I was eating. Would drink again if I'm ever back in San Francisco.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Serving: Bottle  Served: 23 June 2016    Appearance: Had this one straight from the bottle since I couldn't get a glass without looking like a douche. Nonetheless, I really admire Anchor's classic branding, unique bottle shape, and good bottle cap design. Love these little California stubbies.    Smell: Soft, somewhat sweet malt notes. Standard sort of 'beery' smell. Some perceptible herbal and peppery hoppiness.    Taste: Really smooth and pleasant, especially on a hot summer day after working in the yard for 10 hours. Definitely more bitter than many other craft lagers, which was great to see. Nice herbal hop flavors without being hoppy, really. A well balanced flavor that is definitely more on the lager side of things than the ale side (there's some of that bready crispness).    Mouthfeel: Crisp, medium-low body, and high carbonation. Very drinkable and refreshing.    Overall: Perhaps one of the best summer beers out there and one that I'll certainly be adding to my rotation. Definitely recommended, especially for cookouts, BBQs, and outdoor summer meet ups. Will re-review this one when I'm able to pour it.

Smells like a Hefeweizen but not as sweet smelling. Strawberry, cherry, although I just washed my hands in my wife's fancy soap, so these whiffs may be from that..Taste is pretty malty, not bitter. Unique for sure. Stings the tongue the carbonation does. Overall I like it. If there weren't a million other beers to try I'd do this again.

On the palate there was light carbonation and a pleasant hopiness without being overly bitter (I'm not a fan of hop forward beers such as IPA's or bitterness). While it didn't blow me away it was thoroughly enjoyable.

There is little in the flavor to hint at the higher temperature fermentation.     My old friends and I discovered Anchor Steam in the early 70's when distribution was extended to San Diego. I seem to remember a sharp hop- or fermentation-related aftertaste that I enjoyed then. That might have been before the brewing process was "perfected", but I have good memories of that brew's character.

Round biscuit malts, with a bit of dark fruits form a smooth, malty opening. Taste follows suite with smooth, biscuit malt notes, dark fruits, and a twinge of pine hop bitterness. Pine hop notes really sit on the tongue after the finish of the beer. Mouth feel is smooth, and medium-thin. Overall, a good beer, but it seems more like a brown ale with a hoppy after taste.    Served in a 12oz snifter.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Pours a copper color with a creamy/soapy off white head and not a lot of carbonation.    Smells of white bread and malts. More of just a clean beer smell with no adjuncts.    Taste was a touch of caramel sweet malts and just a touch of hops toward the back.    Mouth feel was a refreshing drink of cold beer with a nice crisp finish.    Glad I tried this one! It is a good beer and I can tell that some work went into the crafting of this one. It does seem a bit expensive for just a beer type of beer but it really was worth the try.

S-Mildly roasted malt, slight floral & sweet fruit, as it warmed a distinct banana note appeared.  T-Slightly sweet mildly roasted malt with a hint of charcoal but not in a bad way, almost like  toasted marshmallow. At once followed by a big wonderful hop bitter that endures. Some banana notes  appear as it warms. It's quite complex!   M-Big creamy body that really surprised me. Nicely carbonated.  O-I'd never even heard of this beer before but I intend to have it again, very good! I was expecting  it to be like a lager but it's more like an awesome pale ale with super mouthfeel.

Finish is lightly dry with a touch of lingering bitterness.  Overall a well balanced pleasant beer that is so readily available that I think it taken for granted. The date code indicates this is right at two months old which is quite fresh. There is now a timeline mini history lesson under the bottle cap.

APPEARANCE: pours a clear amber color with less than one-finger off-white head that quickly dissipated until a thin, broken layer of small bubbles remained, there is some lacing on the glass, medium carbonation.    SMELL: sweet caramel and toasted bread.    TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet caramel and toasted bread then an earthy hop profile, this is a malt forward beer, very much like an amber.    PALATE: medium body and carbonation.    OVERALL: this is a good beer, nothing special but solid, I prefer more hops and less malt but this is a good malt forward beer, I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the style but personally would not seek this one out again.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Drops substantial clarity into a light amber liquid, forms a nice 1/2" head, uniform lace, after deft retention.

Always enjoyable when on tap at Pizza Barn in Fallon, NV.

Smell: Tightly balanced toasty grains, lightly fruity esters, and earthy hops.    Taste: Restrained biscuit and toasty malt, hints of caramel, slight fruit and citrus; earth, tea leaves and grassy hops. A piercing, almost astringent bitterness keeps everything in check without dominating. Closes dry and crisp.    Mouthfeel: Medium body, very creamy feel and refreshing carbonation.

Absolutely a classic and a unique beer. Defines "session" beer. Perfect at 4.9% for a long night. Beautiful bronze amber color, plenty of hops, though not an IPA, the Northern Brewers really feature well in this beer. A great intermediate transition beer for someone coming through the ranks of craft beer drinking in terms of hop hit. I remember my wife drinking these quite a bit after moving on from low hopped bears like Newcastle and then finally liking IPAs after these. Nutty, bready, some fruit with some of the dryness, sweetness of some lagers, some of the tartness of an ale it truly stands on it's own in style. 5s across for a world classic like this.

Looks very nice, a transparent orange-ish amber with a bright white head about two fingers. The head lingers and leaves good lacing throughout the glass. Smells sweet, like lagers often do. A pretty subtle scent to it, but there's hints of caramely malts and some faint hop aroma. Taste is actually pretty layered. Starts out sweet and malty, with caramel breadiness and hints of things like licorice and raisins. As the beer travels across the palate, some floral hop flavors and subtle bitterness develops, finishing with a crisp and somewhat dry feel. Flavors are clean and bright. Feel is smooth and creamy. This is a great beer to dissect the subtleties of or to just drink casually.

I have been drinking for 6 straight days so I wanted something a little less potent before I board the plane. Any ways, I always struggle with this style. I want to like it more due to the history of this beer, but I always find the malty aftertaste a bit unsatisfying. Fortunately for the Brewer I always forget this and will likely order this again. Hate to leave California ....beers out here are second to none

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This is a good beer, you need to get it very fresh. My bottle has a Jan. 2018 expiry date, and probably was brewed in the last couple of months or so. It does remind me of the draft in California, so no complaints there.    It has decent, sweetish malt and good, flowery hops. My one issue is the lager yeast leaves a slight stink, it is IMO what other reviewers call grassy or "skunky". It's not skunky, just as many Euro lagers called skunky on the board aren't - look at many Heineken reviews - it's from the yeast, IMO.    It is at a fairly low level of detection, but still, I think it holds it back from being a great beer.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 This may have been my first craft beer... in the 1970s when I moved to the Bay Area.  No matter what else I've tried, I return to Anchor Steam.  It is unique in the flavor and history of beverage.  Anchor Steam spawned a revolution in taste that still grows splendidly.  The world is a better place for this.  Anchor Steam is deservedly listed in the "1001".  MJ's 1999 edition gave it 4 stars of 4 and, most unusual for him, about 10 lines of copy.  Reviewed in Roger Protz' " 300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"  Always remember that we stand on the shoulders of giants.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Pours nice and dark, with a hue that can range from amber to golden depending on how the light hits it. Not much in the way of head or active carbonation, but there is the thinnest of caps that sticks around, like a light dusting of snow. Smell is hoppy, but not in a sharp or aggressive way; plenty of malt on the nose, too. Taste is unique. Light hops, and a clear taste of dark fruit (raisins?) Mouthfeel is substantial without being heavy. Good, interesting cousin of the amber, and worth having, though not a favorite of mine.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Nice amber beer with a white head that leaves minimal lacing. The aroma is sweet malt, flowery hops and a hint of caramel. The taste is exactly like the smell except that the caramel flavor is big. The flowery hops and bitterness come in at the finish. Nice medium body and moderate carbonation. This has always been a good drinking beer.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 For the style.  APPEARANCE: Golden amber with a creamy, eggshell 2"+ head that lingers all the way down the glass. Lots of small bubbles rising in the glass. Leaves a thick lacing down the glass.  AROMA: Sweet caramel malt. Some dried lighter fruit, apricot. Some grassiness and earthy qualities to the beer, as well.  TASTE: Lots of sweet caramel and a nice but mild earthy bitterness in the mix. Lightly toasted quality to the beer. Pleasant, mild bitterness on the finish.  FEEL: Very smooth, a little slick. Doesn't finish particularly dry, but is refreshing. Nice bit of carbonation, but not overdone.   OVERALL: Great easy drinking lager with a nice sweet/bitter ratio. Reminds me of some popular Vienna lagers.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Anchor Steam Beer is an iconic beer, but to be honest more a historical one. It looks great in the glass with a deep golden color with tight white one finger head. The smell is grain and malts with a light flowery hop presence. The taste is crisp, with the grains and hops present from the smell. Lightly bitter with a strong carbonation, it's crisp and refreshing, not a WOW beer, but a consistent pleasant pour.

Been reading up on Anchor Brewing Company from several books and my expectations was growing as I read the history around this beer. It was an OK beer and it would have worked better on a Swedish summer evening than in front of the TV on a winter night.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.25 355ml bottle into a conical 2/3 pint glass. Paid £1.79 for a single bottle.    Pours a clear, dark amber coloured body with a small amount of fine visible carbonation. A light, bubbly, two-finger in height, white head fades quickly to a patchy film and collar, leaving token amounts of spotty lacing.    Crisp, grainy, toasted malts and caramel lead the nose upfront. Mild grassy and floral hop profiles follow shortly after, along with aromas of lightly fruity yeast. The taste follows almost exactly, opening with crisp, toasted, pale and caramel malts before a vague fruitiness gently enters around the mid-palate. Light hop bitterness builds towards the back end, taking a mainly grassy form, along with some floral notes and perhaps a trace of citrus peel. In the mouth a light body and plenty of sharp, lively carbonation give a thin but clean and crisp feel. Moderately bitter hops linger just long enough in the finish to cancel out any residual malt sweetness, drying the palate slightly and increasing the sense of refreshment.    Overall this is a decent beer. It’s clean, crisp, refreshing, plenty session-able and widely available at an excellent price point (in the UK at least), but ultimately, so are a lot of other beers. Ignoring the history and heavy steam based marketing, judging on taste alone, this is probably still worth a try, but not worth seeking out specifically to do so.

Taste is similar to the aroma but the hops are a little more piney and the malts hint of maybe a little caramel and fruit. This is a very well balanced beer. Not overpowering, this is great beer to introduce non craft beer drinkers too to get them on board.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Bottled 30 days ago(Pretty damn fresh as far as NJ goes)    L: Poured out much more full bodied, heavier and darker than I imaged. I was expecting a yellow fisy lager or a pilsner like looking beer. I was presently surprised at its darkness. Looks like a Vienna Lager! Poured a large frothy white head, completely filtered. 5/5.    S: Wow, I smell citrsy hops, sweet beady malt, toasted brown bread, grains. Combine all those together and you have a light but very fruity aroma going on from the malts and hop(not hops - its singled hopped with Northern Brewer). Its almost smells like an American Pale Ale.    T: This is a lager? damn fine one. Taste like an American Pale ale with a well defined malt body. Champagne like carbonation, sweet beady malts in the background. The hops make this one finish dry and clean. I figured the IBUs on this one gotta be real close to SN Pale, and guess what they are 35 and SN Pale is 37. Like I said kinda taste like a pale ale. Really surprised me on the taste.    Feel: Its a little light on the body but then again its only 4.9%.     Overall: Amazing beer! classic brew! I cant believe that I have been drinking Craft beer for 10 years now and am just having this now.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Poured into pint glass. It pours a reddish-amber with a thin white head and lacing. It smells of malt and faint dark fruit. The taste begins with biscuit malt and a slight caramel but it finishes fairly dry and bitter. It is a reasonably complex beer. It's medium in body and carbonation and a good session beer at 4.9% ABV. Overall, it's quite good. I seem to recall that it had a somewhat mythic reputation when it was harder to find on the East Coast. While there are definitely better tasting craft beers available, Anchor Steam is enjoyable to drink from time to time.   
look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Nice round nose with a balance of fruit from either the yeast or grain, caramel with a kiss of pine from the hops. Quite clear in the glass, there's quite a bit going on for what is a basic everyday drinker.   But, it's also quite balanced, and brings it all together very nicely. Some bitterness. That fruit and bready caramel maltiness come in to play with some astringency and a slight touch of sulfur around the edges on to the center of the palate. Lovely beer with medium amount of carbonation, and a head which lingers.   This is a quiet unassuming classic that has a lot happening underneath it.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 This is a great beer, but for different reasons.   Everyone here has detailed the character of the beer... Toasted malt flavors, caramel and sugary flavors, juxtaposed with hops, that don't get it in the way and that only balance the strong malt and biscuit flavors.     As a beer, this is a high quality beer definitely in the Lager category.   Perfect for a Backyard BBQ beer on a hot day in July when you're looking for something not particularly strong, and not high in ABV.     As a craft beer, this beer may not impress your craft beer buddies. It is not a strong tasting beer.   What it is - is an exceptionally well-balanced and soft-spoken beer.     This is the PERFECT beer to introduce to your Budweiser and Miller Lite swill drinking buddies.   A beer that isn't too strong, and not too far left of center from what they're ALREADY drinking.  And perhaps you haven't found the perfect beer to introduce them to...   Now you have.     I think its the perfect summertime afternoon beer outside by the pool or grill.  And if I have some Budweiser Buddie's coming by - and want to be a good host - I'll have this in the fridge for them, as the thought of buying Bud or Miller just makes me cringe.    It's a classic. Some of your Budweiser Buddies may think so too.    Cheers!

And for someone who is not a fan of lagers in general, that's saying a lot.    Feel: Fairly substantial for the style, but not overwhelming.    Overall: Near perfect. This stuff is my jam! My go-to beer. Whatever else I may get, I will always get a six pack of Anchor Steam.

Very classic 'beer' look. Smell and taste are both grain-forward, the taste being a little dirtier. Biscuit, lemon, even sulfur. Definitely tastes like a 100% barley bill. Not sweet, gentle bite of bitterness. Body is full, smooth, assertive but not intruding carbonation.  Yep, that there's a beer right there.

look: 4.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a 12oz bottle (bottled 09Jul15) into a pilsner glass.  LOOK: Pours with 2 finger's worth of off-white foam that actually started to increase in size (an incredible first for me). It grew about a finger's worth outside of the glass and cohesion kept the very dense foam head from spilling over. The head never decreased in size due to the plethora of medium and large bubbles ascending to the top. Amber-copper in color. Lacing is very thick but moderate and spotted.   SMELL: Mild biscuity malt and caramel aromas entangle with subtle aromas of floral and spicy hops. Hints of corn can also be detected.  TASTE: Mild flavors of biscuity malts and caramel first enter. 3 seconds pass as mild floral hop and subtle spicy and bitter hops flavors finally enter the palate. By this time, caramel flavors continue to press on, but biscuity malts have grown stronger. A subtle amount of corn flavors enter the palate lastly as all previous flavors persist.  FEEL: Full-bodied with hints of carbonation. Goes down smooth and creamy. Finishes with a moderate dryness.  NOTE: I usally don't like to taste corn in my beers, but this one managed it very well. The first of its style for me. I look forward to trying more.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Wait, what, huh, I've never said anything ever about this?  No time like the right time for this.  Every time, I've ever had it, always the pint glass.  The appearance was a blissfully yellow transparency. Carbonation always feeds the head at a moderate pace. The head dissipates within/about less than a minute. Lacing speckles and slides into the beer.  The smell is crisp sweet grains, light sweet corn, and sweet biscuits.  The taste is basically the same. There's a sweet bready aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is light bodied and speckles my tongue with sweetness from the corn and bread.  Overall, hey, what's not to love! Its pure baseball park beer that has nothing obscure about it. To all of the bullshitters who say, its bland because it doesn't have the "complexities" of Alesmith's Speedway Stout or something else of that nature, ask yourselves this, why in the hell are we comparing apples to oranges. Praise to Fritz Maytag for creating a style that hasn't gone the way of the buffalo and when I wanna drink light, this is what I go for. There's nothing off in this one, its in your heads.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Jeez, took me about 20 years to revisit this. Great looking pour of chill-hazed copper with thin, though dense head. Aromas are excellent bready malt and caramel with a faint alcohol. All very complementary. Flavors are similar, thought the sweetness anticipated is subdued, and a clean/dry finish ensues. Slightly rough mouth-feel, but otherwise a winner. Wish I had more than one.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 355 mL bottle from a sixer picked up at the LCBO; best before Sept 2017. Listed at 4.8% and served barely chilled.    Pours a gorgeous, clear copper-amber colour, throwing up nearly an inch of fluffy, bone white-coloured head that displays superb retention. It gradually dissipates into a thick, creamy cap, leaving behind a curtain of lacing as it crawls downward over the next ten minutes or so. Very visually impressive, but the aroma keeps things in perspective for me. It smells clean, but straightforward - some bready, doughy malt sweetness, with a touch of caramelized sugar, earthy silage and fruit skins - I'm leaning toward apple and white grape, but the fruity facets of the nose are fairly ambiguous in stripe.    The flavour profile follows in the footsteps of the aroma - it is nowhere near complex, but you can tell that quality ingredients went into its making. Clean, bready barley malt sweetness is the name of the game for the first half of the sip, followed by a hint of caramel/honey sweetness and some additional ambiguous orchard fruit esters. It gets earthier toward the back end as the hops begin to strut their stuff, including wet hay mixed in with some floral notes. Bittersweet in the aftertaste; emphasis leaning towards the bitter, but still quite well-balanced overall. Light-ish in body, with moderate carbonation that offers up a restrained bite. Super-quaffable; rarely have I classified something as a "session beer" with more enthusiasm.    Final Grade: 4.22, an A-. Anchor Steam is a solid little brew, and one which the bulk of beer drinkers should find to be highly approachable. Indeed, it's not difficult to understand how this time-tested recipe has remained popular over the years - it is downright tasty and perfectly balanced. While there is certainly no shortage of more exciting styles to explore these days, well-brewed classics such as this will always manage to retain the business of consumers who appreciate a quality session beer. The quintessential steam beer, and totally a must-try.

A friend of mine asked me to pick some up for him, so I got some for myself as well.  A - brilliant amber colored body with a frothy off-white head that holds excellent retention leaving thick lacing on the glass as it slowly fades down  S - very earthy; pale malt, and yeast in the nose as well  T - yeast, pale malt, earthy & spicy hops,   M - medium body, very creamy and smooth, finishes dry with moderate bitterness  O - an American classic, but I've never been that crazy over it. Good to come back to, but I bet it will be a long while before I come back to it again.

The date is "5UP" (which magically translates to born on 6/15/15)    S: [3.50] Prominent "lager" type scents. Breadiness. Biscuit. Caramalized sugars.     T: [3.50] My first instinct was Belgian yeast (for the first several sips) but that was gone so fast that it almost didn't seem real. After that if follows the nose. Bready flavors with some malt backbone sweetness. I still get hints of some spiciness from the yeast.    M: [3.25] Tingly carbonation. Decent body to back it up.    O: [3.25] This is nothing to write home about. It is a solid beer. Tastes like a traditional lager with maybe a tiny curve ball with the yeast. It is drinkable and repeatable. But also forgettable.

Not really any sweetness to speak of. Malty middle turns slightly sour, then the firm woody, stemmy bitter back end of Northern Brewer hops. It's a very strong and distinctive hop, but it is not done in excessive quantities here.    M: lighter side of mid weight. Lots of carbonation. Very clean finish.     O: a great amber lager (style) beer with very firm bitter back end. In the dark old days before craft beer, I can see why this was so loved. Now it's A very good, well-made beer, but nothing to write home about. I'd buy it again occasionally. Probably among the best sub-5% beers ever.

I used to have this on draft all the time when we went out. A real classic. Look is amber, head is fantastic and lingers long. Smell: Bready, sweet and a touch of bitterness. Roasted malts. Taste: I can't believe this beer is sub-5% alcohol. Tastes terrific for such an offering. Roasted and semisweet malts, a bit of toastiness, bitter hops at the finish. I appreciate this beer so much more now that I've been around the good-beer block. This one is a winner. Cheers to the real San Francisco treat.

Then it's herbal dry hops for what I consider to be the best finish in any beer to date. It's drawn out, not bitter, not sweet, but not bland.    F: Typical lager carbonation here. Nothing noteworthy.    O: I love this beer. It's a bit simplistic maybe, but it's just a great heavy lager. Reminds me of pils with more flavor. I a shockingly bitter IPA and a complex coffee stout, but this...this is just a very tasty beer! I hope that makes sense. Give this brew a try. I think it hits all the marks for a steam/California common. Bonus, it has a great unique fermentation process!

It sports plenty of flavor yet a low 4.9% ABV.    Look-This one pours a clear mahogany amber color with thick bubbles of carbonation clinging to the glass as the head settles from thick to a thin layer. It glints a reddish-orange in the light.    Smell-The smell is simple yet satisfying. I smell English yeast and malts as well as a hint of grape skins at the end.     Taste-It’s heavier than a pilsner and richer than a lager. I can taste some West coast style hops amidst the malt-forward components of this beer. It has a rich biscuit taste with a dry hopped finish, but is not bitter. The caramel malts run rampant until the hops build on the tongue. There is a slight sweetness that is perfectly balanced by a tinge of hops.    Mouthfeel-It is a medium/light bodied brew, ample carbonation, and with a lingering toasty or oily aftertaste.     Overall- It is a very pleasant and unique beer that I was glad to try. It drinks like a 6% brew, but has a variety of attributes that are unlike most beers. Cheers!

A little heavier than a pilsner.    A great argument for a brewer's flagship beer being a solidly crafted lager and not a suped-up hop monster.

The nose leads with a caramel maltiness and earthy hop notes. The taste leads with a sweet malt, toasted bread and an earthy pine bitterness that coats your mouth. The carbonation is very active but doesn't really cut through the coating of bitterness. Enjoyed the malty flavour but thought that the high carbonation was too distracting. Just not my thing I guess.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Look: Three fingers of tan head has some nice sticking power. Beer is slightly hazy and amber in color. Super active carbonation. Light lacing.    Smell: Caramel and bread malts. Slight hint of sea salt. Fruity ester at the end.    Taste: Much more salt than was originally on the nose. Light noble hop bitter finish. Pretty interesting balance between sweet, salty, and bitter.    Feel: Kinda watery. Fun carbonation. Crisp and clean.    Overall: Gets all fives from me as it is a tent-pole of a brewing style. This is what all other Cali Commons are based on. That being said, it is a really great beer. Sure it's essentially a lager, but this more complex than most lagers I've had and it is very well balanced. Best enjoyed overlooking the Pacific Ocean.

A- pours a clear dark red/ copper color with about a 2 finger head that quickly dissipated leaving some good lacing.     S- nice sweet bready aroma, maybe some caramel malts and few fruity notes    T- very smooth malty taste, not overly sweet which I hate in my beers and not very bitter, a very good balance actually. Bread and some caramel seem to be the main flavor here. Bitterness seems to increase as the beer warms up    M- average to high carbo, medium mouthfeel, leaving a mild burn feeling    O- I grabbed this beer thinking I wasn't going to like it, but it's actually a very solid beer, seems like a great Bbq or just drinking beer with your non-craft friends. Not my usual IPA that I would pick, but just a smooth easy drinking beer.

The aroma is classic malt sweetness with a touch of tropical fruit and and little earthy quality. The mildly bitter tropical hop flavor is present at the start of the sip, supported by a semi-sweet malt backbone. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. This is a classic beer. I often pass it over in the store, but I should give it more attention. Great in all seasons, awesome with a wide variety of dishes, this is a pure, everyday table beer.

Nose was a bit of biscuit malt and a hint of honey. Tastes of just a hint of malt and finishes with a surprisingly strong hop kick. This is more like an IPA to my uneducated palate. The beer has a nice clean feel. This is a good beer but a bit to hoppy for me.

It definitely seems like an old fashioned beer for lack of a better way to put it because it does have a bit of that grainy malt flavor but the richness of the malt and hop character definitely put it above your average macro. As the beer warms the biscuit sweet malt comes out and reminds me of a samuel adams lager. Very drinkable and a full body for only a 4.9 percent. Definitely an artfully crafted beer.

Nose smells like a classic lager but with a bit more malt and some roasty notes.    Taste is unique. Starts like a pilsner with a breadiness, hay, slight iron note, and lemony citrus. Then the malt kicks in with some sweetness and a slight earthiness. Additionally it has only a mild amount of carbonation, less than normal for a pilsner but slightly above or equal to an amber ale.    Overall slightly strange combination. It's like a light amber ale or malty pilsner, which isn't necessarily a good thing. I'm slightly puzzled about this beer. I see it pairing well with San Fran oysters with mignonette sauce. It gets a 74/100.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Shhhteamy.     Appearance : Epic head of Godzilla proportions. Solid four finger, leaving mountains and hills of cascading foam lace on the sides as it recedes at a pace that would make cold molasses blush. It finally settles at like, an off-kilter head, some places its two fingers, others its one. The body is dark amber, lemon tea colored, with about 80% opacity.     Aroma : Ginger! Orange slice. Roasted malts! A little white grape. And faint lavender, with light grassy hop. Bouquet is medium to strong.    Taste : Pale hops come out right away, with a rather sharp punch. But the ginger, orange, and roasted malts tend to balance that out a bit, however the hop wins the boxing match and it ends strong on piney hop and some orange muffin.     Feel : Buzzing, medium bodied, lightly creamy, ends crisp and sun-dried. Nothing substantial but appropriate.     Overall : This is a decent beer. Tastes more like an IPA with orange accents than anything. I'd have it again, but it's a bit hoppy for my tastes.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Clean lager-like yeast aroma but with some mild fruitiness, on the side of apricot. Woody/minty hops with caramel malt. Graham cracker and biscuits. Very balanced, flavors mingle quite well together.    Pours brilliantly clear. Amber/bronze with large off white, almost light tan head. Great lacing and head retention.    Caramel malts in the flavor with clean lager yeast profile again with some fruit character. Apricot and strawberry. Biscuit, toasty malt. Firm hop bitterness, woody and slightly fruity. Some nice spices too.    Medium light body with medium carbonation. Smooth on the palate. Lingering finish with hop bitterness. Very dry.    I hadn't had this beer in quite a while and kind of wrote it off as an acceptable standard. Having been enjoying German beers recently, this one hit me quite nicely. A lot of American beers seem to lack the balance and subtlety that German beers have. I think this beer gets passed over because it's not sour, overly hoppy, or high ABV. I like all of those things, but I do wish there were more American breweries trying something like this out.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 After reading the first few chapters of "The Audacity of Hope" I was very excited to try this beer. Overall I think it's a pretty average beer, a little too much carbonation for my tastes and I'm not the biggest fan of the pokey hop profile that seems a bit unfounded. Mouthfeel is about what youd expect. Not a bad beer for casual drinking but certainly not the best.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Look: Clear Amber-Gold with nice foamy white head that leaves some lacing	  Smell: Light caramel and grassy aromas	  Taste: I like the complexity and subtlety of the steam beer. It has some of the fruity and floral aspects I like about ales but it has a cleanness and dryness that I like about lagers. it has that characteristic floral aroma of Anchor beers and a mild herbal grassy hoppiness.	  Feel: Smooth with perfect carbonation, light to medium body.	    Overall: Steam Beer is a great session beer. Despite the overall lightness and low ABV there is subtlety to its flavor. A characteristic Anchor fruity and floral aroma serves as a backdrop for the otherwise fairly clean and dry balance between malt and light herbal/grassy hops. I still prefer the Liberty Ale but the Steam Beer is a great standby.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Pours a pale amber/copper color with a fizzy white 1 inch head with good retention.       Smell is malty, slight fruity notes.    Taste is very much an american beer, if Budweiser or the like actually kept some depth to their beer, it would taste like this. Sweet malt, minor bitters take the middle, aftertaste comes through as toasted grain and biscuit.     Light-medium bodied, very drinkable, is a good compromise between smooth and crisp.     A tasty, drinkable brew, not much complexity, but what it does it does right.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Appearance: copper colour with a slight tangerine head. Aroma: Fruity esters from the yeast, caramel sweetness from the malt as well as a earthiness from the hops. Flavour: Caramel, candy like sweetness,pleasant bitterness. Like this beer a lot   
look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3 A very lucid and clear amber with off-white bubbly head of medium retention. Aromatically it is caramel, bread, and esters. Grainy and sweet up front. Crisp, bready, lightly hopped finish. Light to medium bodied and watery with fairly moderate carbonation. Not as good of a beer as I had hoped. I would prefer a pilsner or a decent all-malt pale/premium to this, to be honest. But it's really not a bad beer.

Not sure what they did to the barley malt but it is pretty strong    F - Easy to drink feeling and sessionable, but complex in flavor.     O - This beer is mostly made of malts, but the intensity is very good for the stronger palates. Certainly a historic and delicious beer for any beer lover.

Very easy to drink, but not that exciting.    Mouthfeel: Very nice. Good carbonation and very quaffable.    Overall, this is a good beer for what it is. Very drinkable and also very sessionable. Not a very overpowering or interesting flavor palate, but I don't think that's what they were intending here. This is essentially a more finely crafted take on a standard American amber lager

S - Smells light and a little hoppy.     T - Delighted with very strong toast, caramel, and yeast-imparted flavors. The hops provide a bitter tease in the aftertaste that contrasts very well with bread yeast dominant flavors. It's really good!    F - Crisp. Lightly carbonated.     O - I was quite blown away by this beer. It is really good! I had been putting off trying this one for a while because a coworker said she wasn't a fan of it, so I assumed it wasn't good. As a matter of fact, this is a very enjoyable beer. If you are into bread-dominant flavors, this one will sing to you. Couldn't see myself drinking this one frequently, but I'm sure it'd pair well with a plate of fish and chips, or crab cioppino. It probably would be an excellent choice for cooking with.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Having drank beer every weekend for 15 or 20 years, I had a month-long diet/workout that didn't allow for beer or other alcohol. I had a while to plan for my "first" beer celebrating the end of this apocalypse and craved an Anchor Steam. Not disappointed--I'm a little surprised I hadn't rated or reviewed this one before.    Pours maybe one shade lighter than a pale ale with a 1 or 2-finger whitish head. Crackery, mildly spicy, crisp & refreshing. Mild floral aura. Sessionable, as far as I'm concerned. Not overly complex, so neither does this review need to be.    And it may seem petty, but I have always loved the whole package of Anchor beers--the roundish bottle, the label, the cap. Maybe I'm a little over-sensitive after having been "away"...

It's very good and a bit underrated.

Leaves a ton of lacing. 4.5    S: Malty, caramel, sweet, bread yeast, very subtle hop spice. 3.5    T: More hops than on the nose, with bitterness, floral notes, and some hop spice. Lots of malty characters, particularly caramel malt. Very nice lager combo of malts and hops. 3.75    M/D: Medium body, appropriate carbonation, drinkability is average. 3.75    O: Solid beer. Nothing spectacular but hits most of when I look for in a solid lager style beer. 3.75
