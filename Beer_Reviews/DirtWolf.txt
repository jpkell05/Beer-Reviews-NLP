look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Very nice double IPA with some great flavors and nice blend of hops. Pours a slightly darker yellow color with some faint haze, small amount of white foamy head and some spotty lingering lacing. Smells great, nice combination of citrus zest and floral hops - and those floral hops really pop at the end of a long inhale. Also a little malt, vanilla and caramel. Tastes of fruity hops - mainly grapefruit, mango, tangerine and pineapple. The floral hops are less pronounced. Nice notes of vanilla, bread, caramel and malt. Smooth, clean, crisp, mild mouthfeel and good carbonation. I didn’t experience as much bitterness as other reviews had described - instead, I was struck by the bright floral hoppy notes and good mild malt backbone that didn’t overwhelm the flavors. Very well done.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Presentation: Draft, served in a snifter.    Appearance: It's a crystal clear gold color with a one finger head that goes away quickly leaving some patchy lacing behind.    Smell: Mostly fruit and citrus with notes of fresh grapefruit and oranges along with some more zesty citrus peel aromas.    Taste: It's very bitter and fruity. There's grapefruit, tangerine and the slightest hint of malt sweetness in the background.    Mouthfeel: It's full bodied, smooth and creamy with medium carbonation.    Overall: A fruity and robust DIPA that's very bitter but still manageable.

Aroma is slendid... with very mouth watering fruity citrus with a slight something to it.  As for taste...forget about it! it has everthing the "old factory" picks up in aroma and more, smooth fruity with a little something something at the end. Very nice accent to it.  For the feel...kind of the same, smooth with a slight bitter kick at the end. Superb!!!  This is a great double IPA and worthy of its 8.7ABV in every way.

At 65 IBU and 8.7 abv you get a smooth bitterness and strong content beer where you don’t taste the alcohol.     I fully recommend this beer when relaxing and hanging out with friends and family.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Fantastic smell, overflowing head. This beer pales by comparison to its predecessor - Hop Wallop in both taste and smoothness. It is a very good IPA and is of very good value for the ABV, but it simply takes a back seat to both the legendary Hop Wallop and Hop Ranch (also now defunct). If this beer was available in cans I might buy it once in a while, but it simply lacks the taste of Hop Wallop. Whereas Hop Wallop and Hop Ranch were case-worthy, Dirtwolf simply is lacking the qualities of these other superior beers. When will Victory come to their senses and start brewing fantastic beers again?

Aroma- hoppy, grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple with a tiny bit of pine. not too shabby.    Flavor- like the aroma but with some caramel malt. nice. the alcohol is easily detectable but nothing overly crazy. bitterness is there and hangs for a bit.     Mouthfeel- medium with the slightest bit of heaviness in the body. really good carbonation.    Drinkability- easily will purchase this again.    Overall- any hophead out there needs to try this beer. i'm not a huge fan of the tropical ipa's out there but this one isn't strongly in that category. real hop forward beer. only thing negative is the abv that is really noticeable but like I stated it's nothing too crazy.

For this reason I'll never seek it out again.

Nothing jumps out at me however. Its very balaced is the best compliment I can give it.

Smell is fresh strong hops with faint malt. Taste is similar, with just enough malt to keep this from being totally hop-oriented. Extremely drinkable. Quaffable, even, yet no sacrifice in terms of flavor. Great balanced example of the style. If you want the full flavor experience of a DIPA but none of the heavyness or cloying mouthfeel, here’s your beer.

Smell is boozy with slight earthy, spicy hoppiness and passion fruit     Feel is on thin side despite 8.7% abv that finishes with a piney hop kick that lays itself on the tongue which makes this beer dangerously drinkable and bit dry in finish     Taste is pine, bread, simcoe, mosaic, caramel, melon, cantaloupe, malt, mango, alcohol is well hidden in the flavor     Overall there are better IPAs out there but this would be perfect to getting a night started. Down 4 of these and you'll be off to a great night that you'll need a friend to explain to you on the next day. This is super smooth for an IPA and is sickening how drinkable they made an 8.7% abv beer to be. After demolishing one you want to grab another.    Also as other reviewers pointed out this beer most likely will result in a hangover. I woke up with a hangover from just drinking 2 and i drink high abv beers all the time and don't typically get hangovers for I don't tend to drink more than 2. Makes me believe this beer has a high sugar intake that would be the main cause to it. Nevertheless beer tastes good.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 poured into a tumbler it had about a half inch head. fairly light in color with lacing sticking to the glass on every sip. smells of sweeter tropical fruit and grapefruit with a little bit of pine thrown in for good measure. mouth feel is on the medium to lighter side. In all a very good beer that isn't as bitter as I would like but easily one of the best ipas coming out of Pennsylvania. great beer that I would recommend to anyone who likes ipas   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I think this is Victory's best beer. Storm King still a formidable challenger though, being former champion and all. Pours a hearty golden color, 1/3" white head on the top. Aroma smacks of dry hopping, they really nailed this, has all the proprietary aroma hops like Mosaic and Citra.     Standard hop bearers like Simcoe & Chinook provide the bittering. They got away from using excessive caramel like malts like they did in Hop Wallop and that other hoppy beer of theirs (I forget the name). This is a light Golden Promise(?) like affair, just pale, lightly toasted malt that lets the hops shine. Equal parts citrus, tropical and pine. Any use of caramel is well restrained. Price is good, availability is good, alcohol well hidden. Sure, you could stand in line for hours at a time and spend $5 a can on something comparable. But don't you have more of a life than that? Grab a 4 or 6 of this from the gas station and go chat up some honeys, not neckbeards in line.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 This beer is shocking smooth and refreshing. High velocity flavors of grapefruit smack your throat upon taking a pull from the chilled glass bottle's neck. I recommended this beer to be paired with grilled meats and marijuana cigarettes.

Does not get all the acclaim that Victory's Hop Devil IPA seems to receive, but in my opinion DirtWolf is clearly superior

Taste- A mix of grapefruit, pineapple, and melons meet a dank pine hop. The malt was present and a nice bitterness for the finish.     Mouthfeel- A nice thickness with medium carbonation and a dry finish.     Overall- A great double IPA with a good mix of citrus and piney hops notes. Solid beer

Pale in color with lots of carbonation and limited head and almost no lace. Nose is grassy with citrus and medicine with booze lingering in the background.     Serious hops and pine in the flavor, but withering bitterness is not brutal and the alcohol is likewise under control. Balance is nil but that kind of goes with the territory. Serious lemon and medicine flavors dominate. Texture is thick but doesn't completely mask the octane. A little simplistic, but delivers on its promises.     Personally, I could go for a little more nuance, but Dirtwolf makes no apologies, and I can respect that.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I had this on draught in a bar. 16 oz. pour served in a pint glass. It pours a crystal clear, golden color with a milk-white head and minimal lacing. It smells of melon, pineapple, grapefruit, pine needles, floral hops, and a whiff of vanilla. The first taste sensation is sweet melon and caramel on the tip of the tongue but it is quickly overwhelmed by the resinous Mosaic and Simcoe hops. It finishes biting and bitter and leaves a strong, bitter aftertaste. Yet, the sweet, malty opening and the hoppy, bitter finish blend seamlessly. This ale is medium-bodied with lively carbonation, and its 8.7% ABV gives it a nice kick. Overall, this DIPA is well-balanced and very tasty. And it proves that a DIPA doesn't have to be turbid to be really satisfying. Well done!

Orange, pineapple, mango and grapefruit. There are also sweet caramel and some malts in there as well. The flavor is super balanced.    Feel - Medium bodied well carbonated, just a touch of dry finish and no sign of the alcohol, slightly slick feel.    Overall - A very well done DIPA, the citrus and hop/pine is very well balanced.

Aroma is pungent grapefruit pith, pine & floral notes, moderate vegetable & onion notes backed by subdued toast, caramel & a little biscuit malts. Taste is hugely hoppy! Oily pineapple, orange zests, pine needles & resin. Spicy, peppery & pungent. The vegetable & onion notes are still present but greatly subdued from what they are in the nose. Malts provide cane syrup & caramel tones. Alcohol spice is prominent. Huge hop bite & bitterness from start through aftertaste. Floral tones & hints of dark tea in the finish. This brew is exquisitely bitter with complex hoppiness. Mouthfeel exhibits moderately heavy body & carbonation, is prickly with spice, dry, slightly chewy, pungent, & mildly astringent. Alcohol is well hidden in terms of taste & warmth but seems to be a major component of the spicy character.

The malt bill provides adequate balance, but it's definitely a hop bomb. The mouthfeel is good. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a terrific DIPA. It's often a go to beer for me when I'm looking for a good hoppy DIPA.

I chilled it in an ice bucket for 20 minutes and poured it into a Schott Pure water glass. Here's my review:    L: A pretty golden color that brings to mind the white wines of Savoie. A thin lace of foam reminds you that its beer, not wine.    S: Smells like hops. What more can I say?    T: This is no Resin. It's more bitter and less refined. Maybe the comparison is not fair but Resin is the king of IPAs in my world view. That said, it's not a bad DIPA and I like buying American.    F: The mouthfeel is lovely. No complaints.    O: This will get the job done but it's not a world beating DIPA.

Poured a lightly hazy deep yellow color, with about 1/2 inch of white head that had light-moderate retention and light lace.    The aroma did have an aspect of musty dirt, close to the dictionary definition of dank in fact. Hop forward, with a light malt scent in the background. Taste was the same musty, earthy, mildly funky.    Body was light-medium, with a mostly dry finish. Drinkability was a bit of a chore, due to the basement dank. Overall, I didn't miss anything with initial hype this beer received. Go ahead and tick it if you haven't, but you haven't missed anything.

The smell of DirtWolf is rich with hops, grains and malts. There is also a rich sweetness in the smell of this IPA. This double IPA has the look and smell of most IPA's on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is bold with Hoppy goodness. Then the brew smooths out with grains and malts. There is a lot going on in DirtWolf. Victory DirtWolf also has a nice amount of lacing to it. The hops are bold and rich but not overpowering. DirtWolf has a real nice balance to it, this brew goes down nice and smooth. It is really hard to pick up on the 8.70% ABV in this brew. I can't get over how smooth this brew is. The mouth feel of DirtWolf is bold , hoppie,rich, clean, and refreshing. If you are a fan of hops look this one up. Overall I'm giving DirtWolf a 4.50 out of 5. I would buy this brew again. Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown, did a real nice job with this Double IPA.

Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this brew's head is two fingers thick and off-white, with lateral lacing, and a medium-light amber body.    I smell pungent pine, citrus, & "catty" hops with a funkier malt foundation.    Tastes like a slightly acrid mix of the smell with an Asiago bread malt base. Different, but very enjoyable.    The mouthfeel is medium with mild carbonation.    Overall, I'll give DirtWolf | Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown a 4.5. Give this a try when you want a DIPA of its own accord.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 For me this is the prototypical double IPA: resinous on the nose, full bodied, vegetal and hoppy, drinkable and hides the alcohol well.    If someone were to ask the difference between an IPA and the Imperial version this beer would be Exhibit A in what makes a double a double. Won't likely ever be confused with an IPA even if it does hide the alcohol. Powerful IPA that is probably too widely available to get the accolades it deserves.   
look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Most recently had in a nonic pint at the Downingtown brewery.     This is one of my go to IPA's - lots of pine resin up front and smooth finish. First sip is always a "wow" for me. Absolutely love the taste of this stuff. Just the right amount of everything as far as I'm concerned. Widely available so I recommend giving this a shot when you see it!

Hops and malt notes battle on the nose, slight citrusy presence in the background. Mild bitterness in the front of the taste, maltiness comes afterward, slight virus notes as well. Alcohol disguised nicely. Well balanced and tasty.

Smell is spicy herbs, a mix of tropical fruits, lemon citrus and grassiness. Taste is the same, with a spicy, resinous, herbaceous quality that's very nice. Moderate lingering pine resin bitterness. Not a trace of alcohol, which is impressive. Just enough malt to back up the hops. Feel is medium and very drinkable. Overall a really good IIPA, nice to have it fresh.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Pours a clear golden color with a decent white head. Definitely clearer than I'm used to for a double IPA. Smells like citrus, pine, and some bready caramel malts. The malt aroma is strong. Taste is very malty for an IPA. To me, the malts overwhelm the hops. There is some citrus and pine there from the hops, but it gets overshadowed by the caramel malt flavor. I had this on tap previously and didn't notice the malts as much. This review is from a bottle, so I'm thinking maybe next time I'll try on tap again. Nothing bad about this beer, but, for me, just too malty for the style.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 I know, I know, I shouldn't review a beer (especially an IPA) after its suggested drink by date. At least I know it's been in my fridge much of the time past the date. Still, I don't get my hands on much east coast beer, so I'll review it anyway.    I don't know if there is a backstory to the name, but actually the name or labeling of this brew isn't what convinced me to grab some, but I've had excellent impressions of Victory's Prima Pils and stout, so pedigree alone is worth a try.    Pours a dark golden amber color, fairly hazy with a decent head that leaves a little lace on my snifter. Smell is pleasingly hoppy and boozy. The hops are more the floral and herbal aromas than the citric/piney hops I'm used to. Maybe not as powerful as I'd hope for a double IPA, but that could be due to sitting around a little longer.    Flavors are complex, with lots of herbal hops, some bready malts and a long finish that grows in bitterness. The full body/mouthfeel lend good balance to the hefty flavors going on. Overall, a tasty and enjoyable brew that I'm enjoying especially for the departure from the typical double IPA. I'll always love the NW IPA style, but pick this one up if you're in the mood for a variation of the typical double IPA interpretation.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Nosed from the bottle, a perfect blend of citrus (tangerine, lime, kumquat, orange, and blood orange), resin, and whole cone hops. An exceptionally balanced hop profile on the nose. Pours a reasonably clear honey with a half finger white foam head. The palate leads with pine and strong bittering hop and progresses to a more citrus backend with the same fruit elements as the nose. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, an incredibly solid, balanced, DIPA, and at $10 for a four pack, an exceptional value.

The hops are well balanced and really puts out a fine finished product.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 A- Beautiful golden color. Not the straw yellow that most pilsners are, but a beautiful shade of gold with a hint of amber. Lots of visible carbonation, and a huge foamy head from a mildly aggressive pour that lingers for a surprising amount of time.    S- Huge citrus and pine hop aromas with orange peel and aroma of straight up lemon juice.    T- Follows the nose, but WOW. It's like an explosion of tangy, bitter hop and citrus flavors in my mouth. The bite from the hops balances perfectly with the citrus flavors here, and just enough malty sweetness in the background.    F- Easy drinking body for the ABV, but still a sipper due only to the amazing flavor and bitterness that I just want to last forever. Surprising amount of carbonation as well, that tickles the tongue. I think this bottle may have gotten a bit shaken in transit though, as it seemed close to being a gusher.    O- One of my top 5 IPAs out there. If you want hops, and that juicy, citrus burst of flavor that East Coast IPAs are known for, look no further. I would say that this is the best representation of the East Coast IPA out there, bar none. As Far as "Pure" representations of the IPA style go, this is my favorite of all time. I may like DFH 120 Minute IPA more overall, but I would consider that more of a barleywine, which I prefer over IPAs as a style.

Aroma of pine and honeydew, with a little skunk and maybe a little mango and pineapple behind. Similar flavors up front in the nose, with a highly bitter, almost astringent aftertaste. There's also an earthy, tea-and-twig-like element to the flavor. Extremely prickly mouthfeel with high carbonation. Interesting. I remember having this on tap a couple years ago and loving it. Picked this four-pack up fresh from the brewery, and it's not quite what I remember.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Description: Pours a bright, clear, golden yellow with a thick (1-2 fingers) of white head that sticks around and leaves a significant amount of lacing. The nose is pine, dank and ripe/overripe, tropical fruit. There's more bitterness in the taste than the smell profile would indicate. A bitter, very clean finish reminded me of a West Coast style and while there was some sweetness/fruit the pine and bitterness won out. Mouthfeel was light to medium and carbonation was low.    Suggested food pairing: Fish tacos    If you like this beer then you should also try: Truth    Overall: 4 (This beer is good and I may or may not drink it again) This beer felt like it did a lot of things well, but nothing was really outstanding. I was a little disappointed given the high rating this has garnered. At this price point and availability (which are both reasonable) you can probably find something better.

Nice transition to a piney hop. Slightly astringent at the end, but that doesn't last long. Medium bodied with moderate to heavy carbonation. Yep, have to add it to one of my favorites list.

Retention is so-so, dies back to a heavy ring of suds with just a bit of lacing.    S: Smells sharp and clean, with the mosaic hops center stage, pineapple, kiwi and vanilla.    T: A quick hint of sweet malt upfront, with fresh bread and caramel apple, then it's all hops with the entire spectrum of bright tropical fruits, peach and jungle flowers in the middle followed by just a little bitter pine and lemon zest. The bitterness doesn't linger, forcing you to go back for another sip. The alcohol is deviously well hidden.    F: Crisp and medium-bodied, almost sticky, amply carbonated.    O: A very most excellent DIPA! I had to go back and check the abv two or three times - a boy could become seriously incapacitated here were he not paying close attention.

Poured a half-finger of bright white head that fell fairly quickly. Sparse lacing. Rouses well with agitation to a large, frothy head that refused to fall.    Smell: Pretty great mixture of fruit and pine. Tangerine and grapefruit come to the forefront. Bit of peach and apricot too. One of the best noses I've found outside of the New England IPAs. Bit of malt sneaking its way in there too.     Taste: Hoppy but not too bitter upfront. Malt backbone comes through as that fades. Tangerine and citrus lingers. Unusual experience, usually the hop and fruit flavors are on opposite bookends of similar beers. Definitely made for an interesting and unexpected tasting experience.     Feel: So so so smooth. Carbonation right on the sweet-spot for me. Clean, crisp, and refreshing. Alcohol is almost non-apparent.     Overall: One of the most drinkable beers I've had lately, and definitely the most drinkable DIPA I've had in a while. A few of these on a hot summer day could be dangerous for sure.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a refrigerared 4-pack bottle bought at Spec's for $9.75 cash. So. Many. Bubbles. Ridiculously huge head, you can see the carbonation clearly rising for a long long time, tons of bubbles. Great foamy lacing around the whole glass.    Smell is kinda grainy, a little pale and faint citrus. Taste kind of reflects this, with the citrus and light malt taking the forefront, with a lot of carbonation making this an extremely refreshing, gulp down kind of beer. Some subtle hop tones on the after taste, and a bit of resiny pine that comes out as you continue to drink. I could see this as being an easily tolerable beer for many people. Hides the alcohol quite well and there is really not too much hop bitterness so to speak.     Nice rewarding sour taste on the back of the tongue as you continue to drink as well, and citrusy resin that sits on your pallet nicely. Very neat beer, can't find anything wrong with it, does what it wants to do well. Finger wide head remaining 15+ minutes after pour, pretty impressive. Cheers! My first beer by these folks.

Smells of heavy floral and citrusy hops, slight dankness, slight pine, and pleasant generic fruity sweetness. Taste reflects the smell. Initial floral and citrus hops, ample pine flavors, finishes with a pleasant citrus rind bitterness. Feel is fluffier and pleasant, it fits the floral and citrus aspects. Overall, this is a good beer with great floral and citrus hoppy aspects.

Appearance - Pours a nice bright golden color, lighter in color than many DIPA's. A small head of about three quarters of a finger is poured and lingers for a short while before coalescing into a thin film. Many small bubbles and a little bit of tiny sediment pieces floating around in the glass.    Smell - Deep resounding grapefruit aroma initially with some blend of orange and mango with a overripe dankness lingering behind. Someone mentioned rubber, and that's as close as I can come to describing one of the other (off) aromas although sweaty gym socks might be a close second.. Nose just keeps coming in an it's not my cup of tea.    Taste - Big and bold, with some alcoholic kick. Grapefruit and pine are the best way to describe this. Mild malt body hop forward. Not bad but the nose doesn't help the otherwise good taste.    Mouthfeel - Clean and spritzy, good carbonation, very dry finish and modest body.    Overall - Easy enough to drink, but the nose while initially good, was way too dank for my liking and as a result the remaining scores suffered. Still not sure if it's just this bottle or my glass, the first bottle I enjoyed (but didn't review, didn't have nearly this much dank aroma. Will investigate and hopefully update my ratings if this particular bottle might've been a misfire.

Hard to believe this is 8.7 ABV -- drinks much lighter. I will definitely be buying more of this.

Pours an almost clear straw colored ale with a billowing amount of off-white colored head. Good staying power and decent lacing.    Getting some good pine whiffs, dankness, citrus, rubber and blood orange.    Taste is citrus splash with a good amount of hops shining through. There is a nice sweetness that counterbalances the hops and makes each sip very enjoyable. Sweet malty backbone in this with a good amount of bitterness on the aftertaste. Could be a touch more malty based on the age.    Overall this was every bit of what I was hoping for….and this was from a bottle supposed to be enjoyed by September 6th 2015!! I can only salivate on how this would taste fresh.

Bright, tingling hop aroma. A lot of pine and some citrus notes. Body is thicker than expected, and sits nice in the mouth, kind of creamy. Bitterness is present throughout, and intensifies at the finish. Taste is like it smells, but also some creamy, malty flavors.    Overall, this is a very enjoyable, piney and well balanced DIPA. I tried the Hop Wallop recently, and this is definitely an improvement.

S: Fragrantly floral, like flower pollen itself, with a big earthy, almost dirty smell. There's also some orange, grapefruit, underripe pineapple and grass.    T: A big bite of orange and grapefruit peel upfront. Subtle undertones of white peach and pineapple. There's a solid--yet crisp--pilsner malt backbone of slightly toasty crackers. Finishes grassy and very earthy, like soil itself, along with a touch of alcohol warmth. Lingering orange and grapefruit bitterness.    F: Medium-bodied, nice pushing carbonation, lightly dry finish.    O: Not quite as blown away as my first review, but this still stands as a solid beer. Dry, crisp, and quite hoppy.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I never seem to get much of a head here even with an aggressive pour. Nonetheless I get a good whiff of pure citrusy-piney-flowery-dankness with a bit of a sweet citrus infused rum smell that I love. Looks is a bit like orange kool-aid since there is no head. Not much lacing either. Mouthfeel is bitter off the bat as I expect a DIPA to be, really got my tastebuds excited, not too much sting from carbonation and after swallowing the roof of my mouth is slightly oily feeling but i think it's from over-reaction of taste buds goin nuts. Taste is a bit duller than expected from some other DIPAs (this coincidentally was one of my first IPAs and it was super strong then, after 3 or 4 over the months it seems to have mellowed a bit) but overall taste still is one of my favorite in any IPA category that I've had this past year, prob in top 5. Super happy it's readily available in Indiana. Very drinkable even at 8.7abv.

The hops are up front with enough malt balance to allow you to enjoy the hop flavors.It is hop forward then malty with a hop finish.Unlike the aroma theinitial taste and finish is pine. As you savor it, you will pick up more of the citrus characteristics, but pinry up front and on the finish.  F: Awesome mouth feel - good carbonation, mouth coating, and slightly boozy  O: A truly complex IPA. The taste experience goes from citrusy to candy to an appropriately bitter finish.This drinks like a session IPA but don't fail to respect the ABV!

Aroma: Very nice tropical and citrus aromas with mango, pineapple and grapefruit taking centre stage. Some light pine and citrus peel in the background.    Taste: Grapefruit, orange and pine but the lasting taste is a sweet candy orange with some light bitterness.    Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with mid to high carbonation.

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 5 A wise man once said: “In the land of countless Double IPAs (aka America) the best hop balanced beer is king.” [that wise man was me btw] It is armed with this foreknowledge that I approach one of the most highly rated DIPAs with trepidation, I mean it’s not every day you get to sup on the fine nectar of the hopped potion known to men and gods as ‘beer’ (let’s not forget woman too - or woman deities such as Ninkasi the Sumerian goddess of beer - cheers to equality Doc!). DirtWolf - the name even sounds like an 80’s TV series based on a stealth helicopter, YEAH.    Poured from a 355ml bottle into a Duvel tulip.    A: Cloudy straw/pale amber body with a massive 2 inch white head that soon settles to a half centimetre lace - it might have been shaken but it was never stirred... damn those Bond puns sneaking in due to the upcoming Spectre film. Pale colour for an IPA, but decent nonetheless. 8/10.    S: Hops so fresh you’d think that they were picked yesterday. Bold grapefruit and herbal hops with a hint of tinned pineapple chunks - this is one chunky and delightful perfume you have Mr. DirtWolf. Background notes of a solid biscuit and orange candy malt base provide a foil ensuring the hops don’t completely steal the show. This is an A+ DIPA aroma. 10/10.    T: All of the above comes to life and dances an Irish jig on my tastebuds. In the immortal words of Ken Griffey Jr. "There's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited" - only this one delightful concoction that won’t give you an extreme case of gigantism. Overall a touch on the sweet side, however if you’re over the OTT bitter DIPAs (like I am lately) this is a fresh approach that will leave you wanting another bottle (or a case in my instance). Ooo, hint of cracked pepper in there as well, damn DirtWolf - you be FINE! 10/10.    M: Medium bodied with a medium carbonation, a spot fizzier than I’m used to with this style, burps were forthcoming. 8/10.    D: Doc’s new favourite DIPA (or IPA for that matter!) right here. The only big negative I could come up with is: finishing the bottle. Damn I have one more left and Plonk (whom I convinced to get this in) are completely out of it now. Oh well, savour this sweet syrup while you can, life is short and then you die and get reincarnated as an obscure cartoon character [FYI: I’m starting my own religion “Toonism”]. Anyway, not relevant! Superlative brew. 10/10.    Food match: This a heavy brew treat it with light fare: Vietnamese, Thai, Indo, etc.

In a land of harsh extremes, this IPA offers the assertive bitterness we expect from the style without the mouth pucker. It feels like a session IPA until you pay the piper as you finish it. I just wish o had a mound of BBQ brisket to enjoy alongside it. I highly recommend this beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured from 12 oz. bottle to snifter.    A: Pours a slightly hazy golden, with a small white head.  S: Mango, pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, pine, highly floral, sweet biscuit. Very nice.  T: Piney, with notes of grapefruit and orange. Sweet malt at the end of the taste with a floral character. Slight resin.  M: Medium.  O: Pretty good. I don't think the taste had as much depth as the nose did, but was still impressive.

There was a small, foamy head that quickly dissipated. Spotty lacing.    S: An oddly muted aroma of hops, malt, and a fruity ingredient.    T: The taste here is not so pleasant: A whole pile of grassy hops, along with a little malt and some citrus (lemon, especially), combined with an almost chemical element, make this a difficult flavor to like. The citrus is nice, but everything else destroys any semblance of balance.    F: A fair amount of carbonation with a very thin, almost watery finish. Light-bodied.    O: All things being subjective, the bevy of high scores for this beer are kind of baffling. This is one of Victory's rare misfires.

A little cloudy and mild carbonation.     S: Like a glass of grapefruit juice with a back of tar. It's like Donald Duck juice.     F: Burns with the best of them. Candy aftertaste. Foams up and goes down with huge citrus. Not Donald Duck. This ain't for kids.     T: Everything that makes an IPA taste great. Two citrus flavors, neither overpowering the other. Slight tar balancing. Plus, a juicy fruit flavor that fills out the portfolio with the mellow burn of a higher ABV    Well. This is one that you should buy, then cellar for two months. I did. When I had these, I felt it was a bit raw. This one I kept for a review, and well, it made the difference. Kind of like Sierra Nevada's Torpedo. Better two months after purchase. I have one cellared for Christmas. Mmmmmmmm.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 One of my favorite double IPA's, also one of the cheapest here in eastern PA. This beer is excellent and while it seems to vary a little bit from batch to batch, even the "not as good" ones are still solid and enjoyable. When you get a good one     A: A hair on the hazy side, but still clearly filtered. I wish more beermakers would make this style unfiltered, it looks nicer and I personally enjoy the funky yeast taste.    S: The wonderful hoppy smell hits you right off the bat. Very floral, I love it.    T: This is one of the best balanced DIPA's you'll find for the money, actually, one of the best DIPA's you'll find period for the dollar. It is very difficult to find fault with this beer. Light on the malts overall but still with a robust barley backbone with some caramel malts that are noticeable, balancing the excellent bitterness that can't be left out in this style IMO.    F: This beer ranks in the mid to low levels of carbonation for this style and is quite drinkable with a pleasant mouthfeel that goes down easy.    Pick this up and try to get a fresh batch - you won't be disappointed.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This was poured into a tulip.  The appearance was a semi-transparent amber color with carbonation to be seen rising at a nice pace. A one finger white foamy head formed and dissipated at a nice pace leaving some stringy lacing all around the glass.  The aroma leans towards the harsh danky to oily covered sweet and barrenly bitter grassy hops. Sweet onion imparts along with an underscore of floral qualities invading my nose.  The flavor takes all of the previously mentioned flavors and boots them along my taste buds nicely. Sweet danky to bitter onion lays down in the aftertaste and soothes into the finish.  The mouthfeel brings about a light to medium bodied feel with a coat of sweet onion hop oils embalming my tongue with a beating unbeknownst to the usual qualities of DIPA's. Bitterness is there in the harshness yet provides a nice earthy feel to it.  Overall, if anything, I liked it for me but DIPA lovers might want to check not just my review but others as this is a different beast of a DIPA. Still, really well done!   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from the tap into a snifter. The appearance is a clear golden color with a medium sized white head.

But a cloyingly sweet backbone.    fee - thin for double ipa.    overall - used to be a favorite of mine. I am glad I waited to review. Unique in taste and enjoyable on occasion. lacks the traditional IPA balance of bitterness from hops with malt backbone.

I'd buy it again.

A little heat from 8+% abv -- prickly  Lots of juicy tropical, piney hops on top of what seems to be (but can't be) a light malt base  Good stuff   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Copper beer, a finger of head, big bubbles that dissipate quickly. Big fruity nose, huge hops, light bitterness. Flavor is likewise - huge flavor, massive hops, but a good amount of candy, fruit, citrus, some caramel sweetness. Body is medium, appropriate for the style. This is quite a tasty DIPA, would definitely have it again.

It's okay it's drinkable and it's an ipa so what do I really think well I don't know but to me it was just not there, yeah I could like this on a day when I don't have anything else in the fridge to drink but would I go to the store and buy it? No way. First of all the smell, it smells like piss at times the look well it's nothing unusual so lets leave it at that, the taste? lest just say that tomatoes with a hint of plastic came to mind and feel? I didn't feel anything, not even a tickle. So there you have it folks it's just okay in my eyes but who knows you might have better vision than me.

I've never quite smelled this before. Very light citrus and some earthy grassy aromas.  T: Malty, tropical citrus body with a strong initial hops presence, the malt fades and a lingering bitter aftertaste. Moderate bitterness, with a slight cigarette ash taste. A really complex taste going on here. Herbal, citrus, ash, grass, earth, pineapple.  Feel: Medium bodied and fairly sweet, good carbonation on the tongue. A little sticky in your mouth.    Overall: A very interesting IPA that has some strange aromas esp at first but they do seem to fade as the beer warms and the head dissipates. It's got that malty, citrus body that typifies the east coast style IPAs. Not my favorite IPA but I can see why others like it.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Victory DirtWolf Double IPA is a unique American Double/Imperial that is satisfying and which perhaps possess a sort of unique flavor among the A.D/Imp. field.    The frothyness of the brew is in between medium-thick on a light/medium/thick scale. The body of the beer is between light and medium on a similar scale. The color of the beer is a translucent but not transparent golden amber. The smell is suggestive of its unique hoppy taste, and light.    The taste is great in that it carries a lot of the tasty hoppyness right on the tip of the toungue per se, right in the beginning of the taste. The fore taste dissolves into a sort of pleasant, and still slightly hoppy after taste.  The taste is also somewhat unique in that the initial hoppy foretaste carrier with it perhaps some of the sort of wild or "wolf" esque hops the beer is perhaps named for. They taste light and more sort of "gamey" than usual hops perhaps, unless that is simply my imagination.    Either way this is a great and unique American Double/Imperial, the hop flavor is really unusual and good, and makes for an altogether light and refreshing hoppy beer in general. A great D.A./Imp, that is perhaps a must try for all those passing through the valley of A.D./Imp. IPAs.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.25 Clear gold colour. Light hops, sweet malts, boozy, yet balanced and a slight fruitiness on the nose. Earthy, sweet malts, fruitiness, with an overall floral taste. Very nice and less interest than most double IPAs.

A: Lots of citrus, mandarin, navel orange, slight hint of pine, sweet malts, mostly citrus on the nose, smells pretty big.     T: Hit of citrus bitterness up front, some pine and resin, balanced finish with the malts, alcohol is not even noticeable, drinks very smooth for a IIPA.     M: A little light for a IIPA, dry, grapefruit peel finish     O: Very drinkable for a IIPA, nice balance of hop bitterness and malts, I'm not a big fan of sweet malty IIPAs and Dirt Wolf does not fall into this category.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Very good DIPA. Dirtwolf pours a much lighter straw color than the copper/bronze I was expecting; a little cloudy, nice lacing. Smells great, with a piney, pleasantly dank note that is markedly different than the citrus-forward beers I've been drinking lately. Tastes great. Fresh and smooth for the ABV; taste follows the smell almost exactly. Despite its heft, Dirtwolf seems less abrasive than Victory's flagship Hop Devil IPA (though sometimes I want that spicy character in an IPA). Impressive.

Sweet aroma of maple and pine... more on the pine side... LOVE the smell of this one! For a Double IPA, Taste is not over powering but well balanced! I do NOT like the cake like feel to this brew however, kinda takes away from the rest of the beer. All this said, OVERALL a very VERY fine brew. HARD to find where I live I do indeed WANNA TRY MORE from these guys. CHEERS!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 This beer looks more like a light lager than a Double IPA: pale gold in color, crystal clear and very effervescent. It pours to a lasting giant pillowy ivory-colored head that would look right at home on a lager as well; lacing consists of very nice rafts and ladders. The nose puts any doubts about what it is to rest: the aroma shows as a fairly intense, smooth, seamless, soapy melange of citrus, pine and florals, joined by pineapple and alcohol overtones. Up front, the palate is bitter resinous pine and citrus, with a nice balancing view of the light bready malt foundation emerging mid-palate, joined on the back end by significant floral and alcohol notes. The finish is a bit astringent, a bit malty and a bit floral/pine, all joined in seconds by a style-moderate clinging hoppy bitterness; the pine/floral notes and the bitterness linger for a few minutes. Mouthfeel is biggish for the light body, and peppery from the very fizzy carbonation. This is a very drinkable, very well-balanced Double IPA that hides its alcohol pretty well. (12 oz bottle, 79 days before best-by date)

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 DATE TASTED: August 30, 2015 ... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... OCCASION: last Movie prep for the new school year with the Return of the King... APPEARANCE: swirling explosion of effervescence cuts through an imposingly hazy, dirty gold body... thick, pillowy, two-finger white head retains impressively... large, looping spaces resembling coral holds steady... AROMA: emboldened lemon and melon with a resinous strength... a nice, subtly malty contour weaves itself in that suggests an attempt at balance... orange and mango in abundance... some alcohol leeches into the nose... PALATE: surprisingly light and smooth, despite the 8.7% ABV , almost as palatable as a pale ale... almost no aftertaste is equally astonishing... as drinkable as a double IPA could be... TASTE: lemon is strong and center, with mango, apple and other fruits...slightly alcoholic, which is off-putting... caramel late, which rounds enough to balance... OVERALL: Saving the imposing silhouette of the DirtWolf for the last day before the school year begins anew, and it is well worth it... a big experience that warms and emboldens, with enough flavor to merit the hoppiness ... not at the level of the almighty HopDevil, but a worthwhile beer that might not be worth its price tag, truth be told... ...

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottle poured into a wide flute glass / pint glass. The aroma is a warm, pleasant, strong citrus and toffee blend with secondary floral and pine notes as well as an undertone of biscuits and earth. It's appearance is an active, effervescent, clear oily orange with a dense, frothy, and abundant, white head that has good retention and lace. The taste is a wonderfully smooth medium high sweet with a complimentary, well blended medium / medium high bitter. The creamy texture has a smooth and foamy carbonation with a medium body. The profile is primarily caramel with a nice citrus compliment, supported by dry pine and earth notes. The finish is dry and clean with a zesty citrus grassy and a mellow bitter herb and earth (a caramel sweetness smoothes out the finish late). These flavors stay strong in the chalky aftertaste, but after a decent amount of time, it turns to a mild burnt bread crust and pine with a touch of citrus to clean up nicely with just a touch of stickiness.

The nose is hoppy, with some very nice citrus/pine notes. The taste is very nice, hoppy, citrusy, and some nice pine notes. Medium body, with a very nice dry/bitter finish. Overall a very tasty brew.

Pours with a relatively small head and light golden-orange color. Big floral scent, with loads of citrus and some hints of pine (or "dirt" in this case). The taste hits you with a ton of citrus and earthy hops, really nice mix of bitterness and sweetness coats your mouth on the way through and lingers. Though it's absolutely a DIPA through and through, the drinkability is fantastic. My family would get a case of this and take it on trips to Cape Cod; my brother and I would drink these without even thinking twice about it. Very enjoyable experience.

I've over looked this one probably a hundred times at my local craft shop and had no idea about its critical acclaim until I happened to stumble upon it on here. Since it isn't a massively hyped $8 bottle, I can assume the ratings shall not let me down. At least I hope not.    Look - Pours a moderately deep golden with a two finger white head that sticks around throughout the entire glass. Carbonation appears high and is even giving me the illusion of a cyclone going on in my glass. Bottle is quite attractive as well which is a slight bonus for this category. Leaves spiral lacing all throughout my glass. This category would get a perfect score if the beer would have been a bit darker. 4.75.    Smell - Y'know how people mention the word ' dank ' with some beers? With this is about as dank of a nose as you could possibly get. Nicely balanced centenniel hit on the forefront and quite floral and leafy. Fruit juices that I can't quite put a finger on. Earthy with just a touch of dirt. 4.75.    Taste - Ever have a beer follow the nose to almost a perfect T? Well this is pretty much that. Centenniel hops stay light to medium with a burst of grapefruit juice and floral aspects followed by the earthiness and just a touch dirty, which makes things more interesting as it kind of compliments the other flavors in a way. 4.75.    Feel - Light and creamy bodied due to the retained head with less carbonation than I had expected after the show it put on in my glass. Swallos easy as can be for the percent. 5.    Overall - Dangerous stuff right here. Drinkability is second to none. Has all the flavors you want in a DIPA without being one sided. Surely not malt heavy. The earthy edge is a bit weird in this guy, but other than that, this is still one of my favorite beers of all time hands down. Could drink morning, day or night, spring, summer, fall or winter. 4.75.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.    Appearance: slightly hazy, golden color with apparent sediment; about a one inch foamy head with good retention; decent lacing    Smell: citrusy; hoppy; fresh cut grass    Taste: tangy grapefruit up front and lingering in the aftertaste; mild hop bitterness; somewhat leafy    Mouthfeel: slight alcohol bite; somewhat "dirty" or mouth coating; a little bit dry    Overall: I was little bit disappointed by this beer. It's typically hoppy and perfectly drinkable, don't get me wrong. I don't know why, but I was expecting more from this DIPA; nothing I can put my finger on. The sediment caught me off guard too, I wasn't expecting that. maybe that's where the "dirt" in DirtWolf comes from. Certainly not horrible, but it didn't knock my socks off either.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 355ml bottle bought from The Corkscrew, Lucan    Poured a nice rich clear golden colour. Slightly off white head with hints of copper poured pretty loose and fizzy then faded almost instantly to light wispy coating with thickish edging... very light carbonation... some patchy lacing...    Aroma - Big blast of juicy tart fruits (melons, pears, lemons) followed by quite a surprising amount of sweet caramel malts, strong piney resin and citrus hopiness, faint tobacco, quite rubbery, honey, cut wet grass / hay...    Taste - Tons of piney and grassy bitterness up front, juicy tart fruits (grapefruit, lemons, pears, bitter oranges), nice caramel malts and notes of floral honey balance out the hops, quite herbal, metallic, earthy tobacco notes, faint salty notes, quite perfumed...    M&D - Fairly smooth with a little oiliness in the background then some sharpness comes through... full bodied... pretty damn drinkable for a nearly 9% beer as the alcohol is very well hidden    Overall - A supremely good DIPA - big, bold and full of flavour but very well balanced... recommended..

One finger white head, small tight bubbles. Good amount of carbonation.     Smell - Juicy, pineapple, sweet orange, tons of grapefruit, some pine dankness. Awesome smelling beer.    Taste - Initially, you get hit with a nice pop of dank bitterness. Mid palate is where the magic happens...tons of grapefruit, pineapple, orange, mango, good amount of pine/resin. No booze. Super drinkable.     Feel - Medium body. Dry finish. Leaves you wanting more.    Overall - In my area, this is the best readily available DIPA on the shelves. Victory really knocked it out of the park with this one. Will always hold a spot as one of my top 5 favorite beers.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a golden straw color and I swear there was a green hue to it as it came out the bottle. Probably from all the hops, or my mind is playing tricks on me. Very clear/filtered beer. Head was lacking but it retained well. Smells of sweet malt and pine but not overly odorous. Citrus hits the tongue first followed my a touch of caramel sweetness and bitter pine. This is a more bitter DIPA than some others that I have had. Well balanced beer, but I don't think it is as good as most people say.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 One of the early, widely available DIPAS and still at an incredible price point. 8.99/4 pack looks better than ever in today's ever rising consumer costs padding the wallets of craft brewers. Its not THE BEST, but it's a very good IPA with grape and Champaign notes (similar to Duvel Tripel Hop). Its easy drinking, lighter, and at 8.7% still competes with the mega-ABV IPAS (because if obnoxious cost isn't an indicator of great beer, surely an obnoxious ABV will sell). One of the best. If you're a self proclaimed beer geek that just follows the sheep, walk outside the herd and try Dirt Wolf. You'll find great beer doesn't have to cost 14-16 bucks to be really good.

Opaque, pale gold colour with a generous, slightly off-white head, which thinned out but left some nice lacing. Floral aroma of grapefruit, pine, earthiness, honey and malt. Low to medium sweetness and similar bitterness. Medium / full body, very noticeable alcohol (boozy but without the burn), smooth, almost oily texture and some gentle bitterness in the finish. Nicely balanced and not as bitter as I was expecting, I consider this one to be decent without being exceptional. 7.

I feel that theres many others that are much better

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 A bright gold beer, though with the faintest bit of haze. Good-looking eggshell head fades slowly in thick sheets of lace. Despite being six months past its best before date, the beer still packs a pungent, mostly piney aroma. I'm getting some background citrus that I'm sure would have been more prominent if fresher. An intensely earthy, resinous palate never overwhelms the caramel malt base. The bitter hop finish is punctuated with some alcohol bite. Still, DirtWolf goes down pretty easy for a beer of its size and is a worthy alternative to the more tropical-tasting West Coast IPAs.

No other brewery that I've tried has mastered all 3 like Victory.

Like others have mentioned one of the staples of this IPA is the noticeable lack of malt flavor and for me that can't be beat. I get turned off by IPAs that are 'excessively' malty and this beer completely avoids that dilemma.     It's gonna take awhile for this beer to be uprooted from my go-to choice, I've yet to find anything that matches it. If you live in the area, go to Victory's brew pub and get a burger with a DirtWolf on draft, you won't regret it.

I get more of that Citra blast when consumed fresh. Otherwise, it feels a bit thin to me. This is a good beer; I'm just not motivated enough to describe all the nuances. I prefer Hop Ranch.

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Look: Ordered this on draft, and there's a bit of a chill haze to the tulip-headed snifter. The color is an orange-tinged medium gold, the trending color for good IPA's, in my opinion! The creamy white head is petite, yet long lasting, and leaves with delicate, even rings of lace on the glass.     Smell: The upfront scent of grassy his relaxes into a scrumptious smelling combination of hot buttered toast, grapefruit, and caramel. Rich and addictive--with every sip, you look forward to the aroma as much as the taste!     Taste: A flavor profile that reminds us that the "double" in "DIPA" applies to more than just the IBU or the ABV. This is a complex beer, but not overwhelming. It still possesses that crisp, lively character we hop heads love, we hops are appropriately celebrated in this case: The dominate flavor is of various citrus rinds, and it balances well with the medium-high bitterness. Neither element possesses that common C-hop bite, but this is only because the diversity of additional flavors allows the hops to shine rather than obstruct. A swig of whiskey deepens the flavor, while Ritz crackers and toasted bread crusts keep things grounded in malt. Some pleasurable, English-style sweetness presents itself as roasted marshmallows, vanilla bean, and a quarter teaspoon of butterscotch, while apricot and peach bring further complement those hops.     Mouthfeel: Creamy, yet balanced by a crispness which is mostly derived from from medium carbonation. The body is medium tangy and as well, a continuation of the beer's theme of hearty balance.     Overall: A fantastic specimen for those of us who sometimes can't decide between an IPA and a Belgian beer--it's both refreshing and complicated, both tangy and sumptuous. For those who want a typical hop-centric DIPA without any distractions, this may not be your beer at the moment. But if you enjoy balance and complexity combined, you must give this a try.

This wolf was a dirty hazed SRM 4-5 with occasional carbonation.    The aroma is dominated by pineapple, leaving little room for spruce tips, light herbal notes, and faint grass.    The bitterness is below expectations, but grass and grapefruit hold their own, well into a mild lingering finish.    Alcohol is noticeable, yet controlled, while the dry cotton texture augments a medium body.    While this was a fine beer on its own, it fairs better with a meal.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Picked up a four-pack at Four Firkins in Minneapolis. The bottled on date suggests this is good for another two months. Poured at about 55 degrees into my Lakefront pint glass.    L: Pours a deep straw color with about an inch of eggshell head that sticks around for a good bit and leaves nice cling on the glass. Just a slight bit of haze to the beer and substantial visible carbonation.    S: Pine and floral hop notes come through in a big way. Some of that good earthy funk notes, as well. Sweet biscuit from the malts. Maybe a touch of citrus rind--but this one is definitely more resinous than fruity.    T: The flavor is not exactly what I was expecting, but it really is nice. I was expecting something of a hop bomb right off the bat, but those big hop notes from the nose are actually a bit muting coming into this one. What that does, however, is make way for a very balanced experience, with the malts having a prominent seat at the table at the start. There's pine hop notes at the front, mingled with some nice bread malts. Very smooth flavors for how big they are. The middle gets a bit more resinous, with just a bit of clear alcohol coming through. The malts continue to be felt into the back, which is wonderfully bitter without making another quick sip impossible. This is quite drinkable for a DIPA.    F: Nicely carbonated, medium-bodied, and creamy at the front. The middle is bright, with the hops asserting themselves more. The back end is a hop head's delight: wonderful bitterness without completely taking away the drinkability. Very nice feel.    O: I don't know how I never got around to trying this beer. It sure is great. I'd put it right up there with 90 Minute and Hop Stoopid--maybe a bit better, even. I normally go for DIPAs with really assertive (almost abrasive) hop flavors, but this one surprised me with how nicely balanced it is, without sacrificing those big flavors. Highly recommend.

look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 I really want to like this beer. To me it's an average double IPA. There is not a lot that stands out. Of course it is a matter of preference. My ideal DIPA will have a very pungent hop aroma and this has very little. Taste has a little piney resin on the front with some sticky earth tones on the back. Not bad, just not for me. Poured from a 12 oz bottle 30 days prior to 'enjoy by' date.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Appearance – The head came up nicely over a slightly-clouded yellowish body.    Smell – The big citrus notes aren’t overly sweet but more rindy with a light aroma of pale malt and some aggressive spicing.    Taste – The hops settle down a bit at the taste but are still big and grapefruit makes an entrance. The malts provide a nice backbone and are a little sweetish.    Mouthfeel – This ale is medium-bodied with some good bitterness and a bit of drying at the finish.    Drinkability – This was the IPA’s strong suit. Often this style doesn’t score well here, but I actually had two of these for the review and could have had a third had tomorrow not been a workday for me.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Look: Hazy Gold with light carbonation.    Smell: Elegant foresty hops.    Taste: Whoa. It has a wonderful bitter kick but finishes with a hint of sweetness. Extremely well balanced for dipa. It seems to have the funky je ne sais quoi that I love about some English-Style IPAs that I don't often find in DIPAs.    Feel: Medium to Medium-Light bodied. Certainly creamy and leaves a wonderful tingle on the tongue and a nice zest on the roof of my mouth.    Overall: It has certain qualities that I really enjoy about all ranges of IPA styles. Its not just some over the top hoppy bitter MFer that some of the West Coast styles turn out. Deffinitly deserves the world-class rating and delivers a rather unique experience from a DIPA. Bravo.

I can always detect citra and mosaic before all others and this dipa is competent it brings the decent hop punch I crave ,as an avid fan of Clown Shoes Space Cake, Dirtwolf delivers it has a slight sweetness with a robust mosaic and citra punch. I would recommend this beer to Double Inda Pale Ale fans it's refined enough to enjoy with dinner but pungent enough to keep your attention on a Saturday night. So if you crave mosaic you gotta try this. This is my first victory brew and I'm excited to try more.
