A very good American Porter justifying all the praise I'd previously heard.

Forms a foamy, three-quarter inch, wheat colored head with solid retention and lacing.  S: Light aromas of cafe au lait, cocoa, malta, and almonds.  T: Palate follow the nose. Bitterness balanced and matched to level of maltiness, resulting in an even flavor.  M: Medium bodied with medium effervescence. Creamy and very smooth.  O: Drinkable and highly enjoyable. Very balanced. Had two and will certainly have more in the future.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Can’t believe I’ve never rated this before!    Pours a deep, opaque black. With a finger of khaki head.    Smells of toasted chocolate malts, with a crispness rather than sweetness, that hints at a larger presence of hops.    Smooth, creamy, chocolate with a clean crispness that I can best describe as spruce.    As far as body goes, it is a lighter, very drinkable porter. Not sweet, more dry.

The toasted bitterness plays well with the bitterness of the chocolate and the malt is the body that binds everything together.    O: A fine porter. Easy to drink on a cold day. Simple, yet well executed.

Tastes similarly, along with caramel, vanilla and malt. Amazingly smooth and slightly creamy mouthfeel. Good amount of carbonation. I’m used to a little more bite when I sample porters and this one is just so buttery smooth. Well done!

Poured a beautiful black without much head, but with lots of sticky lacing. Smelled of roasted coffee and chocolate, toasty malt, inviting but not too complex. Taste follows, with some bitterness from the roasted malt and slight hop bitterness. Feels slightly creamy, but less robust than I would like, thin at times. Extremely drinkable - goes down smooth.

Though it's a Porter it has more bitterness than most. Bottle declares - "Notes of rich chocolate and coffee, a luscious creaminess and a roasted finish." I'm in agreement with the coffee and roasted finish mostly. Not at the top of the list of my favorite Porters but I'm a Porter guy and would grab this ahead of 80% of the IPA's out there.

look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 3.25 Very conflicted about this beer. Overall, the soda-like qualities of appearance and texture put me off, though this porter brings enough flavor and complexity to the game that i can almost overlook the cardinal sin of brewing a highly flavored beer with no discernible satisfaction. It look like less bubbly cola, unfortunately, though the color is really something. The smell is very complex, with some vanilla, malt, and even a bit of hop action. The taste is the same, with a bit of banana and coffee thrown in there as well. Enjoyable flavor, disappointing texture.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Not what I was expecting , most porters are too much like coffee not this one. Its the right blend of flavors to give it a good dark feel without being heavy like a stout.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 First Deschutes since the Abyss about four years ago. Let's see how it goes. Here goes:    A: Pretty good. A little too much body carbonation for a porter, but this isn't a deal-breaker. Pours deep black with a red hue, leaves a large head and adequate lacing. Good.    S: More chocolatey than fruity, but neither quality is really pronounced. Lots of burnt malt, actually, with faint hints of chocolate and some prunes. Again, no scent besides the burnt malt is really pronounced, but it's pretty complex nonetheless.    T: Follows the nose. Faint hints of chocolate w/ dark fruit in the aftertaste. Burnt malt coats the palate.    F: Little light, but alright.    O: Good beer, but nothing special.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 This is a solid porter. Roasty malt, clean finish. Lighter body with moderate carbonation. Drinkable, sessionable beer. There are other porters I've liked more, usually with and added flavoring like coffee or roasted coconut. This beer is just a little too light on flavor and body for me. It obviously has a good following for a good reason as other reviews show. Just not my favorite.

Aroma is rich roasted malt and earthy hops. Some chocolate and sweet molasses in there as well.    Taste has more dark fruit up front, very different from the aroma, like a dark Belgian without the yeast. Sweet roasted malt is there to fill out the end.    Mouthfeel is light-medium, smooth malt feel, low bitterness and super easy drinking.     Overall, an outstanding porter usually available at a great value. Not thick and substantial, but certainly not a thin, watery blowover. This brew has great complex aromas and flavors. A regular in the porter rotation.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into one of my pint glasses, this beer pours a clear, dark brown color with some deep amber/ruby highlights around the edges when held up to the light. Has a slightly tan head that's about an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to a film layer of cluster swirls foam that covers most of the beer's surface and a fairly think ring lining the inside of the glass. Aromas of roasted caramel malts along with hints of cocoa and coffee and some roasted nuts. The taste is pretty much the same, with roasted caramel malt sweetness that's followed by cocoa and coffee notes and some roasted nuttiness. There's a bit of an earthy hop presence that has just a bit of bitterness. Nice balance of flavors. Has a crisp, yet smooth and somewhat creamy, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish with a slightly dry aftertaste. A very solid beer here indeed that's spot on for the style.    Eric

Smells like coffee and (ginger?)bread due to live yeast added. Tastes better than it smells imo but both great. Not too much hint of coffee. Just right. Feels smooth like most porters with balanced bitterness. One of the best brews I’ve personally ever had.

I have a very favorite porter and I like several others.

Personally, not a fan at all. Maybe Founders' Porter has me spoiled.    L: Looks thin, but pretty dark. Cola colors where light does penetrate. Gorgeous head. Jiggled like jello and lasted quite some time, leaving lots of lacing.    S: Very mellow. Charcoal, chocolate, roast, malt, burnt sugar and coffee-like acidity. I don't notice any hop character.    T: Watery af. Idk where the 192 calories are coming from, because this tastes lighter than Modelo Negra. The roast, chocolate, malt, caramelized sugar, and slight coffee acidity are detectable, but its all very subdued.    F: Even more awful than the flavor. Feels like a cross between an old iced black coffee and a mostly flat soda with a good amount of melted ice in it.    O: Meh. Not for me. I actually prefer my dark beer dark, please?

It pours nearly black with dark walnut and cola hues when held to the light, and a large, foamy, khaki-colored head and lacing. The nose features roasted malt, burnt coffee, and nuts. The taste is similar to the nose but there is an additional hoppy bitterness at the finish. This Porter is fairly light in body with moderate carbonation, and with an ABV of only 5.2% and only 30 IBU, it's really easy to drink. Overall, it's quite good.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Deep, dark brown body topped with a thick, frothy, light tan head. Robust aroma of charred grain with notes of chocolate; roasted nuts. Rich, malty flavor; milk chocolate; cocoa and marshmallows; brown sugar hints; fine bitterness for depth and complexity. Heavy body.    It has been many years since I last tried this beer. It still stands up as a fine example of the American porter style. It delivers a lot of dark, rich lusciousness to the palate; deep sweetness without being cloying and enough bitterness and a touch of dryness to balance everything out. An excellent dark ale.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3.75 Super-deep blackish brown with only the faintest of red hues coming through. Big 'ol creamy, thick khaki head that won't quit. Roasty malt is strong on the nose. There's a lot of chocolate in the taste, and there's a rich creaminess, too. Still, a touch of bitterness to balance. Its body is rich and substantial, a lot like a stout. A good beer, but not necessarily one unique enough to seek out.

Two thirds black, with reddish-brown towards the bottom. Fair amount of carbonation.     Smells of malty chocolate with a hint of coffee    Taste follows the nose, understated, with carbonation popping relentless. Taste reminds me of Black Toad Ale, without the without the grimy twist.     The carb storm settles down by the end of the first pint, by the beginning of the second pint, the experience becomes Grand!     Not bad, it certainly seems boring (style, %), at first, especially compared to their ruling Obsidian Stout, but towards the middle of the second pint, it's old charms present itself commendably. Good show.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 L: Had this beer on-tap at Rivermont Pizza, poured into a pint glass. Had a dark brown color and an opaque consistency. There was an inch of creamy, tan-colored, fairly long-lasting head. Fair lacing.    S: An underwhelming aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, and a little coffee.    T: Tasted of a little bit of chocolate / cocoa (not nearly enough), light coffee notes, a lot of roasted malt, light hops (mostly in the finish), and slight nutty quality. The problem here is that all of the ingredients seem not to be pushed far enough. The flavor has a bland, watery quality that's inescapable.    F: A decent amount of carbonation with a mostly smooth finish. Medium-bodied.    O: The high rating for this beer is somewhat mystifying. It's not the worst porter ever, but certainly not deserving of so much praise.

I'm really missing the old rating system already. Anyway...    Pours a dark brown with a somewhat creamy light brown head. Lacing is apparent, slow falling but not really sticky.  Aroma is a faint milk chocolate. There's also a slightly wet woody/coffee aroma as well, but not powerful at all.  Taste is sort of woody/grainy light chocolate. Tastes a little roasted.  Feel is light with light-medium carbonation. A bit watery for the style, yet somehow, also a little bit creamy.  Overall, I think this is an okay porter. It's pretty straight up and fairly clean tasting, but nothing I would really recommend, unless you're looking for a very mild porter. I was a little disappointed by this, to be honest.

Taste is roasted malt with chocolate notes with a nice smooth mouthfeel. For me this is the Porter that defines porters. The ABV is low enough that you can enjoy more than one but there is enough taste and mouthfeel to make you happy. I'm glad to see these guys in NC and happy that they are putting an east coast brewery up in Roanoke.

Expectations are high given the brewery's reputation and how hard it is to get in the East Coast. (ordered from Tavour) Reviewed live.  Pours a black/brown opaque color with a half a thumbnail length tan head. Once it dissipates, it leaves a ring of lace and a small swirl of film.  Oddly enough, my first impression of the nose is of mild herbs and spices rather the roasty aromas associated with porter. This gives way to toasted and biscuity malts, thus highlighting more the base pale malts. However, soon enough aromas of cocoa, nutty tones and light coffee roast begin to develop. They become more pronounced as the drink warms.   When I get to tasting it, it is truly a pleasant surprise. I'm amazed by the lightness and high drinkability. Creamy, silky and smooth along with a moderate but gentle carbonation. The flavors are nutty, cocoa, coffee and lightly roasted malts. Surprisingly there is a nice touch of citrus hops and lemon twang in the finish, adding some refreshing qualities.   Perhaps I'm drinking this at the right time because lately I've become a bit saturated with the often overbearing sweetness and booziness of today's hyped stouts and porters. It is such a refreshing change of perspective to be able to drink a porter that is clean, understated and elegant in its own mellow way. The low ABV is a bonus in that this is a porter that could truly be a session beer. A quiet classic.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 This is a good-ass porter. Always great to run into a beer of this ilk that's readily available in a city you're visiting - bottle shops, grocery stores, gas stations in Cincinnati. No distro in my home state. Scooped up a chilled six pack, forgot to look for the bottled date.    Charcoal-black pour with a porus, tightly packed brown head that sits and stays. Aroma of bitter chocolate, coffee grounds and char. Taste is right down the pipe as far as porters go - char, chocolate, roasted grains, burnt bread, dark roast coffee, light marshmallow. I seem to pick up marshmallow in porters for some reason. Chewy, thick mouthfeel but still soft. Nice bitter, slightly sweet and roasty feel throughout. Tons of taste for a sessionable ABV. Dinged it a bit on the feel as I picked up a ligering acridity. Great example of the style.

The taste comes in as a extremely balanced yet flavorful porter. All the coffee and toasted bread crust and chocolate flavors that are expected from a porter yet balanced so unbelievably well. The finish leaves you with small nuances that only leave you wanting another drink.

How in the world I've avoided this classic for so long is beyond me. But having tried it, I can say it deserves its place in the pantheon. A classic style for the modern drinker, but not trendy.

Gentle toasted malt aroma with slight char but still some malt sweetness as well. Silky smooth without being too full bodied, layers of nice malt flavors: roasted coffee, burnt caramel, toasted bread, and earthy hops. Finishes with a clean hop and toasted malt bitterness. Terrific balance - hits the mark for a flagship brew.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Black Butte Porter brewed by Deschutes Brewery, with an ABV of 5.20% This American Porter pours out a deep brown color with a small light brown head. This brew has the look of coffee, not saying that is a bad thing. There is also a decent amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell of Black Butte Porter is rich with roasted grians and malts. There is also a nice sweetness and a decent amount of hop bitterness in the smell as well. So far this porter is really inviting. Now for the taste, it is bold but smooth with flavors. There is alot going on in this brew. You first pick up on the sweet Roasted grains and malts and it end with a nice mild hop bitterness. There is a lot going on in Black Butte Porter. This American Porter has a lot going on in it. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. I really like how smooth this brew goes down.   The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Smooth, Roosted, Clean and Refreshing. The body of this brew is a soild medium. I can't get over how smooth this brew goes down. Overall I'm giving Black Butte Porter a 4.75 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again givin the chance to. Deschutes Brewery, did a super nice job with this brew. If you are a fan of Porters you should look this one up.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 L -- Very dark brown, slight ruby. Small white had that dissipates quickly from an average pour.     S -- Roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, slightly sweet banana bread.     T -- Coffee comes first, followed by general roast. Chocolate comes in later, with a nice light sweetness. I get momentary notions of the banana bread, which I would be interested in here.     F -- Medium body, good carbonation.     O -- A very nice beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Deschutes is an amazing brewer. They dabble in so many styles and do so very well.    Look- Very dark ruby brown. There is a light tan, fairly thick with a creamy appearance. There is a bit of lacing.    Smell- Chocolate and a little banana.     Taste- Chocolate and banana again, with banana being more dominant. There is a mild bitterness.    Mouthfeel- Milky, but not heavy enough to feel creamy. I would list the body as medium. A little bit of a hoppy bite on the swallow. The aftertaste is light, lingering and bitter banana stays with you.    Overall- I am a fan of stouts, so I need to be careful when rating porters. This one is certainly one the better porters I have tried, to date.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 A dark brown almost black porter except for some dark cherry highlights. Two finger head that dissipates quickly leaving a rim of foam at the edges. Lots of lacing. Smells of sweet malts, definitive chocolate (semi-sweet), with a wonder full tobacco warehouse aroma. The taste is a follow through of the aroma with the addition of mild lightly coffee. Lush and juicy. Chewy. Smooth as silk. Overall this a a fine porter that is only produced by the best of the Craft Breweries. I will definitely keep some on hand. This one leaves you craving another. If you are tasting this for the first time I suggest you buy two. You will need the second.

After 5 minutes mellowed to a tan overcoat with light irregular lacing. Color is brown almost black. Nose is faint chocolate and coffee.

Revisit:    Poured from 12oz bottle into Bell's Oberon Pint Glass. Best By July 22nd 2017.     L: Black with ruby edges. Finger width beige head stays around for quite some time. Good stick to the glass as well. Bumping up this beer's looks.     S: Bittersweet chocolate and leafy hops with coffee undertones.     T: Pretty on the mark the first time, not sure I would change much here.     F: Same again with an added note that this is dry.     O: Again a really stellar beer and porter.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Being new to drinking, this is my 2nd true craft beer I've had, and the 6th one overall.   The look is dark, an almost dark amber color. Very nice foamy head after an aggressive pour.  As for the smell, you can definitely smell some coffee and chocolate, as expected of a Porter. No boozy or off putting smells to be had.  The taste is vibrant with coffee and bakers chocolate, not much bitterness.  The feel is very creamy, and very easy on the palate. No dryness on the back end, and not much of a lingering aftertaste.  All in all, probably the easiest craft beer to drink that I've had so far. At 5.2 abv, it is highly sessionable and all the more enjoyable. I love that it's available in a 6 pack, especially since I just got off work! It's definitely worth a try if you want to go beyond pale ales and lagers   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 12oz longneck bottle into a nonic pint. Extremely dark brown, almost black, with just the barest hint of light coming through the edges. The head is two fingers tall, pillow-you, falling away slowly while leaving a good bit of sticky lacing.    Aroma is mildly sweet, roasted malts, with a bit of toasted bread.    Flavors start out with dark semisweet chocolate up front, with a bit of caramelized sugar. This leads into rich tones of coffee, toasted nuts, with just a touch of herbal hops in the background. The finish is drying and bitter with both hop and coffee notes but not overly long on the palate.     Mouth feel is medium bodied, smooth, very easy drinking, lightly carbonated. The alcohol at 5.2% ABV invites you to have more than one.     Deschutes hit all the marks with Black Butte- rich flavors and easy drinking character make this the model of what a great Porter should be, for me. It's great out of the bottle, and amazing if you cam find it on draft... this one is definitely going to become a go-to beer for me.

L- Amber cola color from the bottle which settles into a dark brown liquid in the glass with a brilliant, clear amber glow. Good carbonation and thin, tan head atop.  S- Chocolate, dark fruit, bread, citrus from the hops, earthy beets smell, and a distinct caramel sweetness.  T- Same as the nose with an upfront smoky dryness which helps calm the sweet notes.  F- Medium bodied with a lingering dryness.  O- A very drinkable beer. It stays true to the style and does try to do anything extravagant. I do find it a bit too thin and would like bolder flavors

The aroma is immediately burnt - little bight of a chemical or charcoal. Some sugar cane. Earthy and sweet    Taste follows the smell closely. Dense burnt rye flavors with just enough sweetness to recognize it as a porter. Lots of dates and raisins in the back end and noticeable hops in the finish. Smokiness and a sugar tackiness lingers. A bit light and perhaps lacking in alcohol.     Smooth full bodied and light carbonation that allows the flavors to remain in the front.     Ideal american porter

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12 ounce bottle, best by date of 04/23/17 printed on the label. Served in a Spiegelau Stout glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head that stayed around for a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee and some dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some bready/grainy malt and caramel noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and is well carbonated. I think it's a good porter overall. With that being said, I remember trying this (and liking it more) in the past, so I'll have to revisit this one soon. $1.79 a single.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 A very dark beer with a decent sized tan head It looks black, but there is some light visible through the edges.    This is the nicest smelling beer I have come across in some time. Chocolate, coffee, sweetness. It reminds me a bit of the smell of a chocolate cake baking.    Chocolate up front, hints of coffee and nuts, and a hint of sweetness. This is almost liquid chocolate cake with nuts on top.    Nice and smooth going down, just a hint of tingling from the carbonation.    I don't know why I didn't try this sooner based on it's reputation, but it does live up to it. This is just a very flavorful beer, and well balanced. For sure, this is one beer that lives up to the word of mouth, well worth trying.

A: pours a Coca Cola brown red body color, +1 off-white finger foam head, spotty lacing, some carbonation.  S: chocolate, cocoa nibs, roasted malt, molasses syrup, chestnuts  M: medium body with a semi dry finish on the tongue  T: hints of coffee, dark cocoa, roasted malt powder, buttery, hints of roasted Chestnut, slightly sweet prune, hints of coca cola  O: fantastic Porter, could easily drink a few these in one session, glad I got to try I will seek more.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Nice dark look. Textured color. Good head.   Nice malty hoppy smell. Sometimes like chocolate, wish this smell was more consistent from batch to batch.  Same issues with consistency on taste which is my only reason for the lower score in the taste category.  Feel and smoothness is great.  Overall strong and almost perfect.   Variability in nature must make it tough!

God I love this beer. So much chocolate, coffee, toast, and deliciously roasted malt. I was one of the people who thought he'd hate dark beers, but this one started me on my journey.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pours intense, dark brown, immediately wafting toasty aromas.     I like beers that do this - stand their ground on one, decent flavour profile, rather than trying to be 4 things at once. Black Butte completely forgoes the cold brew coffee fad of some porters to focus instead on earthiness - roasted malt and baker's cocoa. Sticks in the throat like morning coffee breath.    The feel is perked up by both light carbonation and mildly hoppy undertones that spur another sip, then hugs the gums and tongue as things warm up. A top-of-the-fridge mainstay for stews, chilies, and me.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 "Best by 6/21/16"; drank 1/1/16 @ the Yarchives.     Poured from the bottle into a glass.    Opaque dark brown appearance.     A rough pour yielded a huge tan head; frothy lace.     Fresh earth, lemon & coffee notes in the nose; unique!     Medium mouthfeel.     Fresh earth & lemon flavors up front; smooth cream notes on the finish. This is super fresh & perhaps a touch hoppy, but the lemon notes are actually quite interesting. Very nice.

Small amount of carbonation when I rock the glass. I get a nice a nice dark roasted malt, chocolate, minor coffee quality in the aroma, malt-o-meal, and maybe a bit of an earthy vibe. Same with the flavor. Nice amount of roasted malt and chocolate with no charred or burnt characteristics. Feel is medium bodied, average carbonation, and dry. Damn good stuff.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 "Notes of rich chocolate and coffee, a luscious creaminess and a roasted finish." Brewed in the style of an American Porter, available in 12 oz. bottled 6 packs and on year-round draft.     Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a snifter glass.    (Appearance) Pours a smooth, creamy foam head of a moderate tan color over a deep brown body with ruby highlights and ample carbonation. Retention is good and lacing is light and spotty. 4.5    (Smell) Rich chocolate malts, soft roasted grains, black patent and gentle coffee bitterness with a high cleanliness and a light sweetness. Potency is moderate. 4    (Taste) The flavor is largely the same with cocoa malts, a touch of light caramel sweetness, finishing subtly with a high cleanliness, a pinch of roasted grain, clean coffee bean oils and earthy bitterness. Nicely balanced, very drinkable and highly sessionable. 4.5    (Mouthfeel) Texture is silky, slick, clean, mildly dry. Carbonation is mild, generating a mild frothiness and a mildly crisp finish. Body is medium for the style, medium overall. Balance is nearly even sweet to roasty and earthy bitter. Alcohol presence is light and there are no off characters. 4.25    (Overall) A very ordinary, but incredibly well-done example of the American Porter. Nice presentation of chocolate, roast coffee and caramel tones in this beer throughout, and yet it carries an incredible balance and maintains high drinkability, for a porter that certainly warrants another to immediately follow. Of course, I will have to savor my one bottle and dream of the opportunity to get another in the future. Solid beer in a regularly underwhelming style, well worth seeking out. 4.25    Deschutes Brewery's  Black Butte Porter  4.31/5.00

Taste is well balanced and friendly, no acidity. Lot´s of chocolate, toffee, nuts, coffee and a hint of smoke. Overall great American Porter. Cheers

Taste and mother are tamer in line with Porter style. Sweet toasted malt with hints of chocolate. Typically feel porters cone off as watered down stouts but this one really brings the flavor.

Not too heavy or stout-like.     Look: deep dark brown, nearly black with some ruby highlights. Thin sudsy head that turned creamy.   Smell: dark chocolate and roasted coffee. A little sweet and roasty.   Taste: More chocolate than coffee. Slight char-roast tang. A nice malt finish.   Mouthfeel: A medium full body, not too heavy. Fairly smooth. Moderate carbonation.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Dark brown with ruby highlights, opaque, with a negligible head.     Strong biscuit aroma as well as that of a refreshing morning blend coffee from the malt. The biscuit and roast nose is present and pleasant throughout the entire experience. There is a very nice herbal/floral component from the hops in the background. Burnt sugar, slight raisin ester, and more floral aromas make themselves apparent as the beer warms.    Initially the beer is malty sweet, which evolves into the taste of a wonderful, flaky biscuit, and finally collapses into a oddly satisfying char on the finish, which remains in the after. The herbal hop character is quite noticeable in this porter, and it is very agreeable. A pleasant, medium bitterness and a nice, roast character are in balance. The aftertaste of roasty toasty malt, hop, and slight char is memorable. There is also a light tartness that appears mid-palate, which adds to the overall amenity of this brew.    Zippy throughout most of the sip; a medium-bodied and fairly lively dark beer. Slightly chalky, dry finish really accentuates that fantastic aftertaste.     This is a friendly Porter! A great aftertaste and mouthfeel highlights this extremely well-made beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a Duvel tulip. Label says Best By: 01/31/17.    A- Pours a 99% opaque black color with a 1/2 inch light tan head that retains decently before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of sheer surface foam. Semi-resilient lacing leaves large clots behind.    S- Somewhat sweet roasty aroma with notes of milk chocolate, vanilla and nuts.    T- Quite roasty, bordering on charry but has a good balancing sweetness bringing to mind black licorice, coffee and more vanilla. Also a decent amount of hop bitterness.    M- Slightly creamy with medium carbonation and a fullish body.    O- Certainly more complex and tasty than your average porter but I think Edmund Fitzgerald edges this one out on best widely available porter.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours a very dark color with ruby highlights shining around the edges topped by a thick foamy and kind of soapy tan head. Also saw some particles floating in there.    Smells like toasted bread with a faint hint of bitter chocolate in the background.    Taste is rich decadence of a nicely roasted beer. The bitter chocolate is in there somewhere cause I can find it on the back of the swallow.    Mouth feel is actually pretty light and has a clean finish.    Overall this beer is high class stuff that comes off the shelf at a bargain price. Love to pick up a 12 of this every now and than for me and the wife. The particles were interesting as I am far from the best buy date on the bottle and I don't believe this is bottle conditioned. If some one is worried about a dark beer being to heavy this would be a real shocker because it so light, tasty and refreshing. Had to pick some more up since I had not reviewed it when we have had it in the past. And I am damn happy I HAD to get some more just to review it :)   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 L: Pours opaque black with very nice head; beautiful ruby tone revealed when held up to light.   S: Roasted coffee beans and chocolate.  T: Delicious. Rich chocolate / mocha taste that dissolves to a lingering flavor of coffee. A fair amount of carbonation, as the ample head suggests.  F: A bit thin, perhaps, but the carbonation enhances the flavor.  O: A simply wonderful porter.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Look: At first it appears to pour completely black, but holding up to light reveals a very beautiful dark ruby red color. Just a finger of tan head that dissipates pretty quickly.    Smell: Lots of chocolate and roasted malt. Just a little bit of coffee in there too.    Taste: Delicious chocolate right away. Not too sweet, and definitely not bitter. Dark fruit undertones are there as well. The aftertaste left is chocolate and coffee.    Feel: This is the most balanced porter I have ever had. There's not a lot of carbonation, but enough to make it almost crisp, which is slightly unexpected for a brew like this. I'd expect something a little creamier, but this beer does really well with the lighter body. It makes it very drinkable overall.    Overall: I love this beer. It is my all time favorite. It's the most balanced and delicious porter I have every had so far, and it's my go to for it's great aroma, delicious taste, and drink-ability.

Some lacing is present with some retention.    Smell: Notes of chocolate and a small amount of roasted malts. Wishing for more roasted malts. Seems like maybe a slight presence of hops as well.    Taste: Slight roasted malts, chocolate, small amount of caramel, and a slight hop bite. This porter is lacking roastiness.    Feel: Medium bodied. Wish this was a bit thicker.    Overall: Solid porter here but a step below Founders Porter and Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald in my opinion. Needs the roast of the Founders to take that next step. I was expecting slightly more out of this beer but it is still very solid and I will pick up at a later date and give it another shot.

It's nothing special. Poured into a big glass. It had a brown head that took forever to dissipate. Nice chocolate toffee smell. Even that seemed a little under power. The taste was very light. I could barley taste dark chocolate, coffee, and toffee notes. Seemed a bit watered down. This beer lacked certain qualities that I like in this style of brew. I'd probably stay away from this one. Ill buy Founders, Bells, or Great Lakes Porter any day over this one. Ill give it a decent score though because I've had worse.

Flavor is roasted malts with a faint hoppy bitterness and a bit of chocolate towards the end. Smooth, medium body beer with no carbonation. Overall a nice porter, good representation of the category. There are better ones out there, but this is certainly enjoyable.

A touch metallic. Nothing overpowers.     Very balanced and light for a porter. Chocolate covered cherries and nuttiness. Cherry cola, coffee, fig. Drinking this faster than your average porter. Not towering, not bold, but deliciously drinkable.    A model for the style. Just don't expect something super bold and roasty. This is tame.

I don't love porters, stouts and other thick dark beers ... well, I do LOVE Woot Stout but that's a different story. Either way, I don't crave them but will drink them and sometimes enjoy them. So I got a Deschutes sampler and really enjoyed each one until I got to this one ... it harkens back to the late nineties ... it was a late night of drinking crappy beer. Walking through my house in a slumber, avoiding sleeping bodies and incapacitated friends, I spot an abandoned soldier ... the beer left behind. With double, blurry vision, I reach for the beerverage I deserted, only to take a massive slug of half a warm beer, steeped in a friends dip/snuff - it tasted just like this beer. I'm sorry ... I love Deschutes but this one was not for me, clearly.

Not incredibly complex, but very high in quality of existing flavors. Highly balanced. Slight minty aftertaste. Really superb.    Smooth!     Overall, 4.5 across the board, because it doesn't bring anything new to the table, but what it does bring is excellent, and quintessential of the style.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Had on tap at Deschutes' Portland location. I think this is a really stellar porter. It does what many other porters do but just does it really really well. Beautiful black/brown/ruby color with light tan head. Chocolaty, vanilla, coffee aroma. Tastes the same with some mild hoppiness. Really smooth, creamy, light mouthfeel. Could have a few more of these. Went beautifully with the elk burger.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Less than average SRM for a brown colored beer, not overly sludgy, solid off white 1/2" head on it. Aroma was a lot of C hops. Bitter.    Lots of roasted malt, bitter C hops, light bodied chocolate malt aided by a substantial amount of carbonation for style. Very much like the black ipa craze a few years ago, this has been around forever. Its one of the archtype hoppy porters from days of yore, still popular today.

This is the 28th release in a series of bourbon barrel aged brews with adjuncts consisting of "peated malt, cocoa powder, vanilla bean, and orange peal, 50% of which is aged in bourbon barrels". Hyperbole aside, it's a tasty brew that comes a little short of XXVII. Which I tasted embedded in a vertical flight - 24 through 28, it's a challenging effort to compare these vintages with opinionated friends with discriminating pallets My personal favorite: BB-XXVII - cacao nibs pomegranate molasses (!), Chinese 5 spice(!), apricot, and rosewater (really). Barrel aged. 50%. Bourbon barrel   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 I remember reading about Black Butte Porter in The Brewmaster's Table by Garrett Oliver. I could write my own review of it, but after taking a look back in the book, his description is so on point that I'm just going to leave his words here instead of mine.    "This porter is deep brown and has a complex aroma of hops, dark fruit, licorice, and coffee, with a hint of mint. The palate is soft, and bitterness is restrained as caramel and gentle coffee and chocolate flavors play through the middle, showing a flash of malt sweetness. It glides into a chalky dry finish, though it leaves a fruity impression, as if it had been sweeter." - Garrett Oliver, The Brewmaster's Table    I couldn't have described it better myself. The bottle conditioning adds a unique element to the beer. Highly recommended to any lover of Porter/Stout.

Nice toasty notes that perfectly match the abv and mouthfeel...i can now add Porters on my "try" list thanks to this smooth offering. Thank you deschutes!   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 355ml bottle poured into a pint glass.    Very dark brown to almost black in color, the pour yields massive bubbly tan head with excellent durability, it just slowly subsides and leaves plenty of nice lacing web as well as eternal foamy crown on the surface. The appearance is so appealing.    In a nose, you get creamy, chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, dark bread, charcoal, citric hop and a little glimpse of spiciness.    Big roasted profile with a note of burnt wood, coffee, and charred malt, sweetness draws in at the middle with a moderate touch of creamy chocolate and biscuit. Hops cut in thereafter with a citrus and bitter profiles while finish with a slight astringency that also continues together with slight hop bitterness to generate a pleasant aftertaste.    Light body with smooth mouthfeel and lively carbonation to crisp up the palate, finish is dry and clean.    So sessionable and very high drinkability, this Porter is very well balance and holds devilish quaffing quality. It will lead you up to next sip instantly and bottom up before you are aware of.

Pours a very dark brown with one and a half fingers of tan head that leaves kindergartener's sponge painting lace as it recedes.    Smells of cocoa powder, coffee grounds, roasted caramel malt and mild leafy hops.    Tastes of more semi-sweet cocoa powder, creamy coffee, mildly sweet black licorice, caramel and soft hoppy bitterness.    Feels fluffy and smooth. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation. Finishes dry.    Verdict: Vigorously recommended. Very tasty and easy to drink.

A really sweet tasting beer, very smooth, with a nice lingering mouthfeel.     While this beer didn't overwhelm me, it is still a very good tasting beer. I will revisit again, and again...

Careful pour produced 2 finger head dissipating to thin pancake. Lacing remains all the way down the glass. Smell is roasted malt, yeast, and dark rum(?). Feel is too smooth (almost nitro-like). Taste is good but nothing stands out. Too well balanced? Too mild. Porter is my favorite style. I was disappointed in this one.

Into a Riedel Ouverture beer glass it poured very dark brown/black. The head was tan and a bit over 1 1/2". It makes a very attractive porter.    The smell was coffee and chocolate.    The taste was coffee with a bit of chocolate and some roasted malt. No real bitterness in the finish that I could detect. It all comes together rather well making it what I would call a well-balanced porter. From beginning to finish the beer is smooth with restrained carbonation.    Overall this porter is very, very good. If you like the coffee more than I do you might say excellent. I've been having it with lunch for a couple of weeks now. I highly recommend this porter.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 I've had Black Butte, it seems, every other year for a decade. My opinion has improved each time.    Looks are black to opaque; making this one of the early black crafts born in the 1980s.  Smells convey lots of well-roasted and sweet malts... and coffee.  Tastes convey the same, but we get some chocolate for dessert. (I detect no bitter hops, but at 32 IBU I usually would.)  Feel has this lingering dryness that is more of burnt sugar than hops.  OA: Black Butte just may be my standard for dark and dry without using lots of bitter.    Black Butte is reviewed in the "1001" and most definitely deserves to be on that list.

The color is rich and dark with a lingering tan head that tickles your nose with light coffee, charcoal and roasted grain aromas. The taste is dark roasted smooth with just a breath of hops that finishes off the coffee, cocoa and toasty bread flavor.     Add the great taste to the fair price and generally good availability, and you have a porter that you can keep in your fridge all the time and it will still stand with the best of its type around the world.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Dark brown in color, but not nearly as dark as I would have expected for something called "Black Butte Porter." Similarly, I was expecting a lot of flavor up front (you know, how a butte rises dramatically from the landscape), but the flavor of this is all in the finish. Mild chocolate flavors overscored by roastiness with a dry finish, this lacked the intense character I was really looking for.

I can get Buffalo Sweat and Pale Ale or 8-Bit almost any time on tap. But I love trying the new samplers and found this porter to be my new favorite, even over the Vanilla Bean Buffalo Sweat. It's not as heavy and has a great taste. Had chocolate with it and was amazed at how it added to the flavor. I think it's my new favorite for sure.

Chocolate and caramel vanilla aroma.    Taste (3.75): Roasted malted smokey coffee flavor. Not to intense, doesn't build past the point of it being unwelcoming. Not overly sweet, but still that sweet bready taste. Maybe raison bread?    Mouthfeel (4.25): Beautiful balanced. Not overly sweet upfront, good dryness at the end. Creamy and smooth. Light plus to medium bodied.    Overall (4): There's a reason why this has been a flagship for Deschutes for so long. Thanks guys for this amazingly balanced brew!

Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this beer's head is three fingers thick, with solid lacing, and an otherworldly dark brown body.    Smells like subtle yet pleasant notes of milk chocolate and dare I say,cappuccino? Please let me know if I'm insane for thinking its that and not just the garden variety"coffee" I and all of you have used to describe porters and stouts countless times. But if I am insane for thinking that,yes, this DOES smell like cappuccino, then please let me see what this tastes like before I'm in a straightjacket....    I taste semisweet chocolate, roasted malts, and, yep, muthafuckin' cappuccino! If I get taken away for being a complete loon for thinking such outrageous-ness, please let me have a few of these once in a while.    The mouthfeel I'm picking up is medium-heavy and velvety smooth. Very light on the carbonation;as a porter should be.    Overall, I'll choose to rate Black Butte Porter | Deschutes Brewery with a very well-deserved 4.75.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 From my home state which I am biased towards as we have some of the best and most creative brewers in the US of A. This is my favorite beer for almost any occasion. I is a slightly sweet bold porter with nice aroma and good after-taste. You can find it almost anywhere in the northwest, so it is very available. I find that a 12 oz. bottle goes down very easy, which I find as a sign that the beer is very drinkable. one of my 10 best beers.Clean, rich taste. Creamy flavor. Nice smell.  I wonder how this beer would taste if they nitro'ed it?

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 BBD 5/7/16. Pours black. World class head volume, lacing and retention.    Quite outstanding nose of chocolate, caramel, light roast and even lighter hops over a sweet base that has char notes.    Very light medium body that is smooth and has a light subtle creamy aspect. Superb carbonation level with a tickling middle effervescence that fades to the final burst in the finish.    The flavor profile is outstanding. Intensity is a bit laid back, complexity average and balance is superb. Flavors of the nose all appear - roast and char lead then flow into the sweeter mid-flavors of caramel and chocolate. Hops begin to shine in the middle against a light bitterness in a very unique way - earthy hops become the dominate flavor through the slow fading finish with a complimentary roast note.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 L: Very dark with just a hint of light coming through. Decent head, has some retention.     S: Roasted malts are the dominant smell. Has an underlying sweetness though.     T: That underlying sweetness really comes out in force. Not a sugary sweet or anything, but a sweetness that reminds me of sweetbread, probably because it compliments the roasted malts so well. Has s nice flair of bitterness at the end.     F: Medium body. Could drink it quick if you're not paying attention and trying to take it slow.    O: Not a complex porter but has the fundamentals down perfect and isn't that what really matters when it comes to a good beer?

The smell is amazing roasted malts that reek of coffee and chocolate. There is a nice sweetness in the nose as well. The taste is a superbly balanced medley of coffee, make malt sweetness and bitter chocolate. There is a bitter coffee aftertaste that balances the lingering sweetness. This is a really great porter.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 One of the better porters out there. Very dark with a thin off-white head. The flavor is what sets Black Butte apart; a hint of the smoky/toasty malt, but only a hint. Dark and smooth. One of my favorites of the style.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Had on tap at local bar, poured into tall pilsner glass. Created a thick milk chocolate head on top of a very dark brown body. Light roast, not very sweet, some chocolate hint, malt. Overall smooth flavor. A little light on the body. This one would fit the gap I sometimes experience when I want a nice stout, but wish I had Something a little lighter for a session. Should do the trick nicely.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Deschutes Brewery - Black Butte Porter. 5.2% ABV. 12oz bottle poured into snifter. Best by 5/31/16.    Look: Settles pitch black, with some light brown highlights in the light. Thick, creamy one finger tan head from aggressive pour, which settles into thick lacing.    Smell: Some toasty coffee, dark chocolate, and dark fruits like raspberries and black cherries.    Feel: Medium to light body, fairly carbonated.    Taste: Bitter roast coffee up front, with some hints of bitter chocolate and dark fruit backing it. Leaves a smoky sweetness on the aftertaste.    Overall: This was pretty good, I can see where it gets the good ratings. Great roast and smoky characteristics with prominent coffee flavors.

Some chocolate.    Taste again is mostly light roast coffee. A little bit of chocolate. Very roasty but doesn't carry much bitterness with it.    Lighter body. Does have a dryness to it.     Very good for a light easy drinking porter

Notes of roasted malts, coffee, and milk in the aroma. The taste features a little bit of coffee, chocolate, and milk, with a roasted malt undertone. Mouth feel is really nice. It feels robust and smooth, without finishing too watery. Overall, great, readily available porter right here.     Served in a 12oz snifter.

A- A normal pour creates 2-fingers of tan head atop a near black body that shows dark red edges. The head becomes a spotty film, and leaves awesome webs on the glass.    S- Lots of coffee and chocolate, like a cup of medium roast with a packet of sugar and a splash of cream. Hints of vanilla.    T- Very flavorful. Roasted malts, don't get too charred. More of the sweetened coffee as noted in the aroma. Semi-sweet chocolate mixes with lighter vanilla. Pretty bold.    M- Medium body and medium-light carbonation. Fairly creamy. Dry finish.    O- A really solid Porter. Up there with my favorites (Bell's, Founders, Great Lakes). Flavorful, while staying an easy drinker for sure. Could do quite a few in a sitting. I like my beer a little more local, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured 12oz into a Belgian Snifter. Initial sips around 40 degrees.     Thick light tan head. Excellent lacing. Light can get through even the core of the dark brown body (with hints of red), but not much.     Smells like a typical medium roast. This clearly isn't a coconut & cherry infused, push-the-limits-of-what-we-can-still-call-beer beer. It's just beer. (I like push-the-limits beers)    And it's a very solid beer at that. Very well balanced roast in the taste. But still plenty of flavor to let you know this isn't water. This is one of the few beers I've had recently that was < 8% ABV, and it kicks the cahones out of the others in the flavor department.     This is the kind of beer that could make me second-guess my devotion to big honkin stouts. Nothin special, I wouldn't say I love it. But what it does, it does very well. Will definitely buy again sometime, especially if I'm in the market for something more session-y.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A really good beer. Great flavor for a low ABV beer (not that low ABV = flow flavors, but that seems to be a trend). This is one of my go to non-craft stouts.

Medium body and carbonation. A bit of creaminess. No astringency or warming.    A kinder, gentler porter. In spirit it seems more British than American, and is definitely not a bold Robust Porter like most American Porters.

I was thrilled to come to this page after finishing my first-ever glass of this beer and see it get 100 from the Bros after I decided it was awesome. Poured from bottle into clean tulip glass. Opaque black, truly amazing. Two fingers of beautiful butterscotch-colored foam with trippy lacing. Smells slightly of molasses, tastes of molasses, coffee, chocolate, some of the usual tastes of a good porter but in the smoothest possible blend with buttery mouth feel. If you are looking for bite or kick it doesn't have it, but it's near-perfect winter solace. Or, in this case, reflection of the warm pre-Christmas foggy downpour outside.

The taste is slightly oaky, with lots of coffee. Mouthfeel is moderate rather than creamy.     Just a great representation of what a porter should be.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a 12 oz bottle.     A: Dark, a very dark reddish/brown almost black color. There is a minimal off white colored head that dissipates quickly.     S: A very mild roasty malt aroma – chocolate and coffee.     T: Mild. Very creamy with: chocolate (not sweet), coffee, and some vanilla. The flavor is mild/balanced and does not linger.     M: Very thin, lightly carbonated.     O: Very drinkable beer being both smooth and creamy (despite having a very light mouthfeel) and at a good price point ($9 for a 6-pack). I will buy it again.

Almost some grain in the smell too. I enjoyed this one. Good job Deschutes.

The taste is roasted malt with cocoa and coffee as an aftertaste. This is one of the best beers I have ever had.

Hint of coffee smell comes through.    T: Bland taste. Far from offensive, not quite up to par with the high ratings I read.    F: Light body. Thin and watery. Hint of over carbonation.    O: Forgettable experience. A bit too light for my taste. If you like Anchor Porter, you should try this one. Both of them have a very similar feel.

There was a good amount of lacing left in the wake. The smell has a lot of milk chocolate up front but tries to balance with some coffee. The taste is sweet through the chocolate with a nice balance of the smooth roast in like Flynn. Its smooth on the palate and pretty drinkable. This is a very good American Porter that one should not pass up on if seen.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 One finger head, with lively activity. A lot of small bubbles, which seem to remain relatively static. A nice black color, with some red opacity in it.     A creamy sweetness dominates the taste, with some roasted chocolate flavors as well. A subtle, yet marvelous, smell.     The taste is quite constrained, with a milky chocolate flavor making an appearance in the aftertaste. The carbonation does not dominate the beer, but offers a nice tingling sensation alongside the sweetness of the chocolate. This does not break any conventions, but is pretty damn close to the perfect session porter.     Paid $9.99 for a six-pack.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Black body, the silky tan head is a flash of decadence until it quickly fades. Smell is underpowered but good- chocolate, roasted malt, a misplaced floral note. Taste improves and expands- chocolate, real coffee, burnt wood, hop acidity on the finish. A little sweet. Finish is quick. The body is a little light, and carbonation is the opposite of smooth, but this just means high drinkability.  It hits a high point with all the roasty chocolatey coffee flavors you could want, but the strange floral element in the nose, the quick finish, and the drinkable but light body keep it from being amazing. Great for a shelf beer, but it fell short of incredible for me.

Looking for more in the taste as well. this is definitely a lighter beer that goes down easy which i can appreciate a darker beer that you can easily drink two or more of without being drunk. Would like a little more flavor though, as the beer is off the palate as soon as swallowed.

The one-inch, light tan head lasts a couple minutes, only leaving a bit of lace.    S: 4.25 Roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, and dark coffee are the most prominent aromas. There’s also a bit of hop character thrown, which blends nicely with the more earthy aromas.     T: 4.25 Flavors start off sweet and mild, but quickly move into the roasty elements from the nose. After the roasted malt and coffee flavors comes a wave of both malt and hop bitterness. Finish has more bitterness with some toasted bread flavors.    M: 4 Body is a little too thin, but it really helps drinkability at the same time. Carbonation, however, is on point.    O: 4.25 This is a great example of a classic porter. Nice flavors and very well balanced. Not quite as rich and flavorful as I remember, but still appropriate for the style.
