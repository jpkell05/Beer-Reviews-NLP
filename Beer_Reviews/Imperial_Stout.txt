look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 My last bottle. Today.  After living over seas in Scotland for 4 years, traveling a bit in the British Isles, Germany and Spain. I have developed a passion for strong ales, Porters and Stouts. No more tasteless, discolored, "Rocky-Mountain spring water" or beers that advertise: "less taste-less filling" (I'm sure I got that correct). Anyway, after letting this warm to about 50 to 55 Degrees, I poured this into a "Stout goblet" Very dark, the light from my "Surefire" 500 lumen E2D would not pass through, Tan colored head, of about a inch and a quarter, that took a few minutes to dissipate to a thin ring around the glass. By allowing it to warm to a proper drinking temp, I was able to savor the roasty malt aroma. Smooth mouth feel. With the high ABV, there is some boozy flavor, but that's expected here and in no way takes a way from the enjoyment of this great Russian Imperial Stout. I only hope I'll be able to again acquire this brew, so a s to keep at least a few bottles in the beer fridge.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Was lucky enough to find a cellared 2014 bottle at my favorite bottle shop. The time did this beer such a huge service. Poured thick and drank creamy, just as I hoped. Huge chocolate sweetness without being overdone. No heat whatsoever. So smooth.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Outstanding stout that I finally got to try on tap at Founders (since it was recently retired). Thankfully they brought it back, I think, to commemorate the introduction of their new barrel-aged version. This was the 2017 version - likely smoother and more mellow now that it’s aged, although I really have no point of comparison. Pours a deep, dark, rich black opaque color with some great thin tan head and some sheets of lingering lacing. Smells mainly of dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, nuttiness and malt. Tastes of deep rich dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, roasted nuttiness, malt, vanilla, caramel and biscuit. Smooth, amazingly full, rich mouthfeel that’s a little creamy and flats the palate well. Good amount of carbonation, just enough. An amazingly delicious beer that’s very easy to drink and well worth all the hype.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Does Founders even make a bad beer? I haven’t had one yet. Found a small stash of these 2016 bad boys just sitting on a big retail bar/restaurant chain’s shelf, evidently for years. The barkeep didn’t even know they had them, despite being prominently displayed. That’s ok...I bought all seven to take home. Poured assertively, cellar temp to a tulip glass. Huge dark brown, three finger head. Lots of carbonation, fizzling down to moderate lacing. Nose is dark chocolate, roasted malts, light vanilla. First sips are ridiculous. Bursting with malty goodness, dark, sinister roasted. After a few seconds, you get a heavy hit of bakers chocolate. Entirely balanced. Alcohol bite is nonexistent, just all smooth flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy, heavy, full bodied. What a delicious treat as I sit on my back deck, listening to the wind in the trees, snapping branches, enjoying my good fortune to have found these and to be in a content point in life. It would be nice to see a reprise of this!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Sorry to see it retired. Once of the better impy stouts that did not overdue the hops and let the roasted grain do the work. From bottle dated Nov 2016. Smell is roasted malt, soy, dark fruits.  Color black as midnight with a dark creamy head. Mouth feel is right on, smooth and thick,  Taste is dark chocolate , dark fruits, dates , raisins. A bit of char on the back end. More chocolate as it warms but with maybe a bit of licorice.  Just a classic imperial stout . Still have some 2015 and 2016 cellered to enjoy

I am somewhat perplexed by this because I don't think they use any chocolate in this beer. Very smooth finish. Wow! this is one of the best non adjunct RIS that I ever had. I am glad that I decided to pick up 2 bottles of this. This beer has World Class written all over it. If you want to avoid a beer that has actual chocolate in it because you have type 2 diabetes then this is the beer for you. Cheers! A   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Pours midnight black, minimal head. Great chocolate and vanilla aroma.

Overall I loved this beer - the bar aged this keg for 3 years before tapping it.    10/7/18  Draft at "The Yard" PGH. 2014 Vintage.  4.5 rating

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Best brewery in the world, by far. Had a whole book typed out, hit some stupid fucking key and lost my entire review. Possible improvement to website, auto save your work? Don't know if that's possible but now I'm fucking tired. Great beer, 2016 version obviously has gotten (much) better with age as, years ago, I had this beer 1 years old then fresh the next year and hated both. So there are some examples of (highly hopped) beer improving with age by mellowing a bit. Please don't get me started that, sorry guys, your beer did not get better with age, just older.    Founders had the two best beers of 2017 that would be DKML and Doom, now the two best beers of 2018 KBS and Barrel Runner. And, again, don't get me started on the recent mediocre Barrel Runner reviews. My gosh people, if you don't like big boozy (but not harsh) rum barrel beers then don't drink them. Probably the same idiots who love Sunday Morning Stout (that is a horrible beer and I'm a local). Now this masterpiece, tried on draft last week at the bar, thought it was my hot wings but the beer tasted so good I seeked out a 4 pak. And now I'll get the other 4 sitting there wasting away on the shelf.    Masterpiece at 18 months of age the bitterness has faded into a perfect non barrel aged imperial stout. One of the thickest, most flavorful regular beers I've ever had with no bitterness or off flavors. Flavor profile includes chocolate, vanilla, heavy malts, molasses, pine, and a tiny bit of black licorice which is ok. Really very complex, which I'm sure I'll get more into over the next 3 nights while this 4 pak dissapears like my business.    And this beer was retired? Could've scored this one easy 5's across the board. Wow.

The funny thing is that it says it is "retired" here, but the Prairie Artisan Ales staff insisted that it had just been freshly brewed and shipped to them. Perhaps we should ask Founders? Anyway, freshly brewed or not it was a great stout.    Look: black with a thin mocca head    Aroma: chocolate, vanilla and coffee    Taste: The flavor is caramel, chocolate, vanilla cream, and a coffee like hop kick.    Feel: full bodied, thick creamy but silky   
look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Looks about a 44 on the SRM color index. 2 1/2 year old bottle. NIce mocha colored head with nice lacing. Smells earthy,figs,toffee,fresh tobacco. Tastes like stone fruits,caramel malts,whipped cream. Feel is moderately thick with ample carbonation. Feels smooth and fluffy. I remember when this was fresh and it was a bit rough. I am a advocate for fresh beer,(Lager must be fresh), but high ABV stouts and such are an exception. Overall I think this now extinct brew is world class.

It'd be a 5 ... the hops truly are kicking and at times produce a bitter floral bite right up front, then linger as the malt flavor takes over; the wood flavor midswallow ranges from almost raw oak to full-on charred BBQ wood, almost carbon    F: up front it's big and bad, heavy, thick, almost milk stout lumpy, but it smooths nicely into a silky finish; the beer is at least a couple years old but hasn't lost much carbonation, perhaps a little ... there's enough to offer a light tickle that lightens it into that silky feel    O: the load of malt and hops in this sucker is formidable; at times it's as sweet as a stout with chocolate added, other times it tastes like a fresh West Coast style RIS with hops nipping and bitting and generally causing a ruckus; I get why so many pledged allegiance to this brew ... it's as good as any raw RIS I've tried if not better; if Founders brings it back, I'll be first in line to get some ... until then I got two more bottles and will enjoy each and every sip (thanks, Dave!)

Taste: An outstandingly well-balanced tongue with damp earth, sweet roast malt, and cafe mocha all forward. Back of the tongue has a lingering black coffee bitterness with a tiny hint of vanilla and honey.    Feel: Heavy body with light carbonation, lingering syrup on the tongue. A very weighty beer that definitely leaves you full.     Overall: Founders never fails to deliver great brews, and their imp. stout hits all the notes the style should while minimizing the weaknesses.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 It pours a pitch black color and leaves the same color body with a one inch tan foamy head that rises a bit and drops gently to a centimeter’s worth of head. Lacing is foamy and ringy, lightly clingy. The smell has coffee, malts, dark chocolate and just a bit of licorice really slightly in the background, all combined nicely and coming through in a robust sort of way. The taste is sweet and bitter at different times to show a fantastic complexity between the coffee to the malts, chocolate, and licorice. The palate is medium and smooth. It leaves a bitter aftertaste and finish. It is very drinkable. Overall, this is an absolutely awesome beer for its style and for me.

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a single-serve into a stout goblet.    The beer pours with a viscosity that deserves a motor-oil-like designation and that's high praise for the style. An espresso-brown head that dies somewhat quickly, but gives way to as persistent a lacing as you could ask for. Such a dark brown that were it not for the tan head, it would look black. Exceptionally opaque. I rarely give "5's" on anything. This is a brutally beautiful beer.    Dark coffee/espresso and bitter chocolate rule the nose with boozy/fruity sweetness in the background. Well balanced.    Flavors, like the nose, are bold and straightforward. Classic bitter coffee and dark chocolate with a little bit of cherry and dark-fruit sweetness in the background. Excellent char flavors without getting to toasty. Astringent at the finish but not in an off-putting way.    As full-bodied and chewy as you could ever ask for, the carbonation and booze (which is well-hidden by-the-by) help it from being undrinkably heavy.     I've had this brewer's Breakfast Stout many times, and passed this one by because of how much I liked that offering. Big mistake. You must try.

The beer is as close to black as it can be with abundant chocolate colored head and close to 75% lacing. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, dark malt and faint tobacco take turns appearing as the beer warms. The taste starts with semisweet dark malt, moves to dark chocolate and finishes with the rich tobacco note. Bitterness is a function of roasted malt more than any detectable hop presence. Mouthfeel is fantastic. It's soft with adequate carbonation, full bodied and finishes cleanly with no cloying qualities. Overall, excellent. I've had a lot of RIS but this is in the top two for me in terms of quality for price.

Smell is everything other reviewers have mentioned. Mainly what you would expect of an Imperial stout. And I didn't get the "booziness" other reviewers mentioned. Taste? Well not bad, but the bitter aftertaste that hangs on your palate is not something I like. To me 75 IBU's is a little over the edge for a pleasant tasting stout. I love deep dark beers, but with less of a hop presents and more on the malt side. Example...Black Boss porter. A wonderful Baltic brew.

It just looks odd.  Aroma is all booze at first, but then stone fruit, roast coffee bean, and oak join.  Flavors match with a bitter hop touch at the end after the booze clears the pallette. As the beer warms to room temperature the booze comes on stronger and lasts through to finish.    Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and an oily finish.  Still pretty hot for 16 months. Two more in the beer corner for the future.

F: medium bodied, but smooth and easy to drink.   O: this is a great regular stout will definitely be searching this out in the near future.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 i'm a big Founders fan, but not so much of this offering...    Out of the glass it looks great (and what a great start) - pitch black liquid leading to a dark tan head and lacing that sticks well to the bottom of the pint glass. The smell is a nice blend of booziness and distinctive stout odors that simply made my mouth water from the get-go. But here's were things went a little wonky for me. Though the mouthfeel was full-bodied and rich, there was enough carbonation to distract from the overall experience, then the taste was, well, less than great. In fact, it was by far the booziest imperial stout I have ever had - at least it tasted that way, and I've had stronger ones than 10.5% ABV. The booze flavor simply overpowered whatever else they were trying to do with this. I am a someone who leans towards these, but I'm looking for more complex and well-blended flavors, rather than a short of bourbon or whiskey in my beer. Anyway, it wasn't awful, just not something that tingled my toes. Overall, I like the beer, I'm sure I'll pick up more in the future, but it certainly isn't on the top of my list for imperial stouts.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 A - Pitch black with a nice mocha head  S - Not overly complex, chocolate, coffee, earthy hops. Everything balanced.  T - Follows the smell with a nice bitterness and a perfect balance.   M - Perfect mouthfeel, thick, full bodied, well carbonated (I prefer slightly more)  O - A bold russian imperial stout, one of the best or maybe the best RIS on my list of regularly available brews.

Taste: Roasty malts, rich bittersweet chocolate and coffee with hints of dark fruit balanced with some bitterness. Finish has a lasting ashy charcoal-ness.

The nose on this beer is rather nice; big and bold. Notes of chocolate and coffee with a roasty back note and a tinge of alcohol. Taste follows the smell with a slight creaminess up front followed by a bitterness that is a touch shy of acrid from the roast but still pleasurable. It feels pleasantly thick with not much noticeable carbonation and keeps your lips sticky together. Overall this beer is great. Big and bold with complex roast notes that I imagine would get even better with age.

This is a great stout!!!   
look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Canned 11/30. Drank out of a TEKU glass. Full disclosure, I drank this beer straight from the fridge as opposed to letting it warm up to cellar temp. Beer pours out super dark and inky. Pitch black in the glass with a solid finger of deep dark brown head. Aroma is explosive out of the glass. Tons of chocolate covered cherries which is surprising(and impressive) since I don't think that this beer has had any barrel aging. Just a hint of light roast coffee as well. Flavor is not nearly as fruit forward as the nose. Lots of dark chocolate and coffee with practically no sweetness, which considering it's 75 IBU is not surprising. Beer finishes with an awesome umami(think shitake mushroom) characteristic. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, in line with other stouts in this ABV range. Not the best stout I've ever had, but for a beer that is relatively easy to find, this thing is absolutely amazing. 97 points!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a bottle (2016) into a mini snifter. Pours like engine oil into the glass. A frothy cap or reddish brown bubbles sit on top. The head resembles a chocolate milkshake. Thick lacing on the sides of the glass. Tons of roasted malt on the nose with a touch of dark fruit and a little soy sauce. Tastes of roasted malt with some dark chocolate and a bit of ash in the finish. Chewy mouth with low carbonation. I really enjoy this beer, and I grabbed a couple of extra bottles to tuck away for the later.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 A liquor store by my house had a few 4-packs of this on sale for 5 dollars each. I bought them all. I mention this because the bottled date is 11/24/15 so they were trying to move older stock. This stout still tastes incredibly young and will age extremely well. Much like everyone else has said:  Jet black in color with an awesome chocolate colored head  Aromas of chocolate and coffee, creamy, rich, thick and I'd even say decadent mouth feel.  Wonderful finish that lingers  You can tell some of the alcohol is taming down and the malts are blending together nicely.     Best Imperial Stout I've had.

Nice, soft bitterness and even more coffee on the finish. As complex as any Impy I've had.    Mouthfeel is smooth, soft and thick. I would have liked a little more heft, but damn good.    Great, great Imperial stout. Layer upon layer upon layer of flavors, and one of the best looking beers I've seen.

Feel: Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. Low carbonation. Sweet and dry throughout.    Overall: Top shelf stuff. Really complex but effortless and harmonious flavor profile.

This is an excellent Imperial stout in the American style: multifacted aroma and flavor, but the bittering hops are the primary story.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 12 oz bottle served cold-ish into a chalice.    Appearance - A menacing and ominous jet black beer is poured. Capped with a finger of a coffee with only one cream colored head. Retention is pretty decent given the high ABV. This beer means business.    Smell - Plenty of chocolate (baker's and dark), flashes of espresso, and hints of smoke, tobacco, molasses and licorice.    Taste - Rich flavors. Dark chocolate, black coffee-esque bitterness, smoke, molasses and a touch of licorice. Finishes bitter with some woody and earthy hop bitterness. Just a bit of vanilla sweetness after the initial chocolate rush. Booze in there too. Not a beer to be trifled with. Damn this is good. Complex as hell too.    Mouthfeel - Heavy, chewy, a meal in a glass. Carbonation is fine, body is dense and slick, engine oil like. An astringency in there that prickles the tongue.    Overall - While many imperial stouts are great, this might be the more intense ones out there. Massive bitter flavors, hints of smoke and ash, big league bitterness and the appearance to back it up. What's not to like here. World class all the way. Counting myself lucky right now, enjoying this alongside Smuttynose Baltic Porter, Oskar Blues Ten Fidy and Ballast Point Victory at Sea all for the first time in the past 10 days. To my tastes that's 4 of the very best in the high ABV, stout /porter / flavored stout class. Founders Imperial Stout might be the best of the bunch.

L: Opaque black, with chocolate milk colored 3 finger head that stays around for a long time.     S: Coffee, Dark Chocolate that makes your mouth water, dark roasted malts, leafy hops, molasses, vanilla.     T: Rich cocoa/chocolate and coffee, smoke, vanilla, char, leafy hop bitterness with the dark roasted malts adding a touch of bitterness as well. Pretty complex and tasty but doesn't match the flavors of their Breakfast Stout.     F: Full body. Thick, creamy and dry finish.     O: A great "winter warmer" a bit lacking in carbonation IMO but another great beer from Founder's who continues to impress.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 355ml bottle poured into an imperial pint glass, served chill not cold.    Pitch black in color, the pour forms up majestic creamy dark tan head that stands proud with remarkable strength of retention before slowly subsiding to a forever effervesce layer on the surface and leaving numerous of sticky lacing web all around. I can even see the cascade effect of the head sip by sip, so gorgeous showcase.    The aroma is dominated all over by roasted malt, chocolate, coffee (just slight sour), and cocoa. There are also other varieties of scent as a complement ranging from creamy, charred nut, dark bread, vanilla, caramel, toffee, butter, licorice, and mild leafty hop.    So intense wave of chocolate, cocoa, and coffee sweeps throughout the taste buds and coats the palate for quite some time before roasted, charred nut, some smoke, vanilla, caramel, toffee, butter, licorice, and dark bread following closely together with a bitter kick from both hop and roasted malt to add more depths. It is sweet overall but not cloying being leverage by the greatness of chocolate, coffee, and roasted profile.    The body and palate sensation in term of feeling is nearly flawless, high viscosity, sticky, very full, slick and super velvety smooth through the mouthfeel. Carbonation is pretty low but still has some crisp that is enough to carry all the things well. Finish is pleasantly dry.    This Imperial Stout is a beast. It is tasty as hell and perfectly concealed its alcohol. My recommendation is to enjoy it slowly and only chill not too cold in order to let all the characters disclosing in full scale.   
look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This is possibly the best looking beer I've ever seen. It's what all other imperial stouts strive to be. Clearly very thick as it pours from the bottle, with an inky body and a very dark brown, creamy head. The head hangs around forever and coats the glass gloriously as you drink it down.    Smells like roasted malt, light coffee and chocolate. Not the hugest nose.    Flavor-wise, this beer is ready to go. Inky, concentrated notes of coffee, chocolate and licorice. Ample, but not harsh bitterness. Wood on the finish. No great need to age this one.    Mouthfeel picks up where this beer left off visually. Decadently thick and creamy. Finishes pretty dry despite its gravity and allows some roasty coffee bitterness to linger.

S: Aromas of coffee, vanilla, toffee, toasted malts, dark chocolate, caramel, raisins, and other dark fruits.    T: Taste matches aromas very well. Starts with dark chocolate and coffee followed by cream and vanilla, and then finishes with toasted malts, raisins, and dark fruits.    F: Full bodied. Thick, smooth, and creamy. Very small amount of carbonation.    O: Overall, this is a really great imperial stout. Nice that it's readily available. This was my first time trying this one and I really enjoyed it. Wish I would've tried a fresh one prior to the vintage to see how the flavor profile had changed, but I couldn't resist. Will definitely try this one again.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 The 2016 release of this seasonal Russian Imperial Stout is visual perfection: a giant, sticky, pebbly dark-brown head looms atop a viscous, effervescent, impenetrably black body that is completely devoid of highlights; head retention is very good and lacing is excellent, consisting of thick slabs and cavelets. The medium-large nose is a delicious blend of black-strap molasses and cocoa with a more subtle chocolate ice cream character and hints of toffee and bitter coffee; it presages a balance between sweet and bitter and lies about the ABV, alcohol overtones being deceptively modest. The palate, as promised, is pretty much exactly in balance: a dark, seamless blend of molasses, rich semi-sweet chocolate and dark, bitter toffee, with modest smoky topnotes and a significant alcohol undertow. The finish is a surprisingly modest hit of smoky chocolate, and is pretty boozy; the linger is a moderate chocolate rebound bitterness that lasts for awhile. Mouthfeel is on point for the extra-full body, and is warming; the texture is sticky/thick, velvety smooth, and slightly peppery from the well-expressed carbonation.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Bottle dated 12/12/16. Appearance is jet black with a dark tan head. The head was about two inches. The smell was of roasted coffee and burnt chocolate. It tasted like bitter coffee and chocolate, also. It had a thick and rich mouthfeel. This all led to a bitter coffee aftertaste. This was very good. The bitterness was there, but it did not detract from the beer. This is what an imperial stout should be.

Pours pitch black, appearing opaque in the glass, with a half finger, ight brown head that dissipates to patches, leaving light lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, coffee, chocolate and hint of vanilla. Flavor is rich dark toasted malt with slight char, dark chocolate, molasses with smoky char developing into a smoky malt finish with light hop bitterness. Medium to full bodied, nice mouth feel. A rich, full flavored stout with great chocolate and toasted malt flavors and good char. Flavor is full throughout the taste, starting mostly malty and then revealing smokey and chocolate elements with hop bitterness in the finish. Really nicely done and balanced. Deserves its reputation.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a bottle,into a Funky Buddha snifter.    Thick,creamy,dark khaki colored head,with amazing retention.Consists of small,to large bubbles.Beautiful lacing left on the side of the glass,as the head depletes.Once the head dissolves,it leaves a dark khaki ring around the glass,with a creamy patch in the center.The head retention is uncanny.Black as sin,with absolutely no light showing through the glass.If there is any carbonation I cannot see it due to the color.This beer looks amazing in the glass!!!    On the nose I get dark coffee,and dark chocolate up front,accentuated by dark fruits,roasted dark malts,toffee,cocoa,and caramel.The chocolate and the coffee definitely dominate.Also has a bit of a smokiness to it.Smells great!!!    The palate follows the nose,lots of coffee and chocolate up front,as well as dark fruits,caramel,toffee,dark roasted malts,and cocoa.Nice smokey aftertaste.    Thick,heavy,chewy,and viscous in body,it leaves a sticky coating inside your mouth.Little bit of a warm alcohol feel,with a smokey finish,and a chalky mouth feel.    This is a very good RIS,probably now one of my top 5 favorites.The flavors are very well blended,it smells delicious,it's thick and chewy,it's everything you want in a Russian Imperial Stout.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottled 12/02/15. Poured into a wine glass.     A: Black. Opaque with brown tinges. Espresso crema colored head. About a finger's worth. Excellent, excellent retention with pockets of sticky lacing left onto the glass.     S: Dark roasted malt, malted milk chocolate, dark chocolate, brown sugar and soy sauce.     T: Big roastiness leads. 75 IBU's flexes even after a year. Mid palate takes on some dark fruit characteristics, with intermingling layers of baking cocoa. Not as sugary tasting in the mouth as on the nose. Mid palate picks ups some oiliness and smokiness. Aftertaste of ground coffee beans and slightly sticky sugar.     M: Medium/full bodied. Thick, pretty luscious, with carbonation there to balance out the massive dextrin.     O: Great big bodied Imperial Stout. At a year it's still pretty aggressive. I bet this one would lay down wonderfully. Might have to throw a few down and revisit in a year or two.

I purchased one bottle the other day and returned to one of my favorite styles of beer to see if my opinion had changed.  Well clearly I had screwed up my original rating .  Founders has another masterpiece here in this Russian Imperial Stout .  Pours a pitch black with a nice thick foamy head that leaves tons of lacing .  The smell is loaded with rich flavors of roasted malts, coffee , chocolate and others.  The taste that follows is just as delicious as the smell. This was nothing like I had remembered from 1-2 years ago .   It was absolutely like "Mothers milk" as another member described it .  I could easily have one of these in a coffee mug with breakfast .  Mouthfeel is slightly lighter than say something thick as their Breakfast stout or a Ten Fidy.    Overall I was blown away and sad I only purchased one bottle as I couldn't even make it last as it was so tasty .  I can't wait to purchase some four packs of these if they are still available.  Again it was nothing like I had remembered, so I'm glad I gave it a return try .    OUTSTANDING !!!

Full bodied, medium to soft carbonation and with a very roasty and full of chocolate finish.

Aroma hits all those familiar chocolate and coffee malt notes, with a decent hit of alcohol.     Taste reveals a decadent amount of rich chocolate, coffee, smoke and hops, the latter two in a much more restrained amount compared to the first two. Very smooth, makes you think there is oats in here, but manages to still bring the hop presence and bitterness around at the same time. Very restrained in the alcohol's pronouncement.     Great format, great consistency, great price. Elite 1st tier world class stuff.

The smell is fantastic: chocolate, vanilla, hints of peat, espresso. Kind of a drying aroma. The taste diverges heavily toward tobacco and cocoa powder. A hint of licorice in the long finish. Very thick, oily and heavy but no alcohol around. One of the best imperial stout I have ever had.

Completely dark as night. Smell is wonderful milk chocolate. It smells like a chocolate shake. The taste is phenomenal. Smooth with a medium to thick mouthfeel.. Taste is tremendous roasted, chocolately malts, a hint of dark fruit, and sweetened, charred French roast coffee..    This is a great brew..and if you enjoy Imperial Stouts, it's a must try...

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This stout pours thick oily and black. I had a 2 finger head that eventually turned  into a dark brown ring. The smell is chocolate, coffee, a hint of dark fruits, and malts.   The taste is a strong chocolate with a bitter hop finish. There is also a sweet molasses taste   upfront as it warms up. The feel is thick, chewy, and clings to your mouth nicely. Overall, this is   a nice stout to sip on and enjoy as it warms up. I am not too keen on hop bitterness, but this stout   blends it in very nice. This stout will never get old.

Smell is of intense dark chocolate, roasted coffee, slightly sweet plum scent, with a small amount of hoppiness. Taste reflects the smell beautifully. Initial dark chocolate and toasted flavors lead into a prune/plum like flavor that finishes with a lingering roasty bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick, viscous, and carbonated just right. Overall this is a very good beer with great tastes and scents. An exemplary Russian imperial.

Nose is sweeter than expected, with the roast in the tail.    Taste: ah yes. Roasted like coffee, but also chocolate, sweet dark molasses. Ends with smoky wood like mesquite.     Thick, smooth mouth.    World class, indeed. Everything an imperial should be, bold, dark and exquisite. For fans of porters, stouts, and all brews rich and noir.

Pours bible black  An immortal dark brown tight knit head appears that laced the glass as the level dropped.  Every sip a solid russian imperial stout.   The flavor profile is so dense that the over 10 percent ABV hardly makes itself  known.   The flavor is very smooth bearing hints of coffee, molasses, hops, anise-- I could go on...  Produces a long lasting and pleasant finish.  This beer's flavor coats the palate like a blanket and dissipates gently.  This is one beer I could tank all four bottles of the 4-pack in one sitting!   Gorgeous!

Half finger thick, dark tan colored head, creamy thick. Alcohol legs cling to glass, some spotty head lacing.    Aroma- Rich roast, deep roasted charred malts. Bittersweet dark chocolates, dry cocoa, and smoke. Mild sweet chocolate aromas, caramel. Touch of coffee and hops.    Taste- Charred malt bitterness, roast, smoke. Dark chocolates, earthy hops, cocoa, coffee. Velvety milk chocolates towards the finish, touch of caramel sweetness.    Feel- Medium to full, bitter and drying. Sticky creaminess to the body. Moderate to lower carbonation.    Overall- A really great age for this beer. Roasty / bitter profile is still in the forefront, but sweetness is coming through more. Robust, rich, sweet.

Pours nearly motor-oil black with a thick and dark chocolatey head that sticks around. Aromas and flavors are an intense blend of roasted malts, molasses, coffee, dark chocolate bitterness, and a hint of overripe dark cherries. Thick mouthfeel. One of the absolute best Russian Imperial Stouts out there.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 After a session of drinking an American Blond Ale and then half of an IPA, this was the perfect choice for dessert. I'm surprised I have yet to try this one and will surely come back for more.  It poured a pitch black viscous liquid with a nice tan head that appeared suddenly. It soon dissipated into a thin ring of lace and eventually disappeared entirely. Nevertheless, a good looking drink.  Very complex in both the aroma and taste. In the nose I first detected alcohol, followed by milk chocolate, creamy coffee, roasted malt, dark fruit, and even hops. These flavors were mostly evident in the taste, especially the chocolate, coffee and roasted malt, except that the hops flavors were even more dominant. They provided a moderate bitterness that provided quite a kick; they added balance, an element of spice and a dry finish. The alcohol was well masked.  The body was robust, rich, viscus and full. Very smooth to drink.  This was a fantastic Russian Imperial Stout that had a nice hops kick and was not overly sweet or boozy. I rank it up there amongst the best of the style.

Smells of complex roasted malt, earthy hops, and some char. The taste follows closely with roasted malt, char, hops, and cocoa; good intensity and no dark fruit flavor. Moderate bitterness and light dryness. Above average body and carbonation. Overall, this is a straightforward and well done RIS; very fitting of the style.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 10 oz pour at Craft Beer Co in Covent Garden. Pours almost black with a creamy brown head that leaves a permanent ring and some lacing. Nose is sweet malts, booze, tobacco, and a bit of chocolate. However, it was not as pronounced or complex as expected. Taste is strong initial sweetness followed by lingering bitterness on the back of the palate. Espresso, boozy malts, and some smoky quality. Honestly, some big flavors, but not fully integrated and both the sweetness and lingering bitterness are a little much. More carbonation than expected, but it does prevent it from being cloying. Overall, a very good sipper, but could honestly be better. I'd love to try this with 6 months age to see if the flavors integrate better at that point.

M - thick and chewy, just the way in imperial stout should be. Nailed it.  O - A good representation of the style. I like Founders take on it. I'd definitely buy again. A bit pricey for a four-pack however. I think there are competing beers to be had for better price.

Taste: There are flavors of coffee and dark chocolate, especially in the initial flavors. As the beer warms a bit, roasted malts with a slight burnt tone are evident. Fruity esters of plums and darker fruits are hinted at. It has an over all bittersweet taste to it.     Feel: It is full bodied, chewy, with a velvet like texture. The carbonation is moderately low with a pleasant alcohol warming.     Overall: This is a well balance classic example of a Russian Imperial Stout that is bittersweet overall with strong alcohol warming.

At such an IBU and ABV, mouthfeel is very smooth. Not too bitter or carbonated, just super pleasant. Overall awesome brew, great for any occasion where 10.5% is acceptable

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Black as motor oil. Very small, possibly 3/4 finger head that dissipates straight away. Smell of dark chocolate and burnt malt. Feel is of cream and silk, very smooth. Taste is of the darkest chocolate, burnt to a crisp. Now that I think about it this is almost exactly like a burnt chocolate bar. Faint wisps of coffee, vanilla, and a twinge of bitterness. A good mouthful will convey the presence of alcohol without any of the taste. Kind of hard to explain.     Overall, I'd compare this to a burnt bit of baker's chocolate. Objectively a very good beer but is far too dark for my taste. If you're into stouts this is your jam.

I get some nice fruity end palate that makes this beer so great and I get some every year. a must buy for any beer lover. fOunders rules!

No head, but some patchy brown foam on the sides. Aromas are fantastic: roasted nuts, coffee, mocha, malts, vanilla, and some strong alcohol. Taste follows the nose with some added dark fruit, like plums and raisins, with a roasted flavoring as an after taste. Really creamy, but crisp; great balance that helps bring out the warm alcohol from this drink. Overall, a fantastic beer to end the night on.

Not as aromatic as expected but hints of milk chocolate, smoke, molasses. Taste is high quality dark chocolate, cigar smoke, chewing tobacco,black licorice. Full, creamy mouthfeel. More bitter than most stouts at 75 IBU but after you get used to the bitterness it all comes together nicely. Overall very good

Main flavors is bitter roasted and burnt. Add a fair amount of sweetness, but not enough to balance. It is something like a toasted cookie. Alcohol is not perceived. Provided its 10.5%, it means quite sweet and very roasted.  Later it turns sweeter and sticky, but it is too roasted and boring for my taste.

Appearance: poured motor oil thick with a massive, dark brown head. The beer is pitch black and lets no light through; even on the sides.    Nose: cola, prunes, figs, raisins, cocoa, coffee, alcohol sweetness, vanilla    Taste: smokey, ashtray, cola, bitter hops, chocolate, bakers cocoa, coffee, medium to heavy mouthfeel, nice carbonation for this monster, waves of bitterness from the initial taste to the finish. No alcohol heat at all, very smooth, the 10.5% ABV is hidden well. Very slight boozy note in the distant finish.    Overall: This beer is on the Top 250 for a reason. I'm looking forward to seeing what some cellar time does to this one.

Smell: sweet malt. Taste: first comes the chocolate then the roasted malt and finally the slight bitterness of 75 IBUs. Feel: smooth, full-bodied; 10.5% alcohol apparent but no alcohol burn; very well-balanced. When you quaff this, you know you have a world class Ale! Hard to say which is better -- this or their Breakfast Stout.    I am not associated in any way with Founders Brewing Company nor am I a professional writer/reviewer.

Minimal dark fruit character. Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy body with a distinct creaminess and low carbonation. No alcohol apparent which is surprising for a RIS this young. Finish: Roast and hop bitterness lingers. Fairly dry. Overall: A young beer with strong roast and chocolate character, with a higher than normal body and creaminess. Dark fruit character lacks compared to other imperial stouts. Interested to see how this one ages.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottled on Dec 2nd, '15 & reviewed on Feb 19th, '16. Well, what have we here? Does this "Founders" place know anything about dark-as-night, heavy-bodied, complex, malt and hop heavy brewing? Boys & girls, we can safely say "yes" to the Nth power. Inky black, solid head from the bottle. Let it warm and a bouquet of licorice, coffee, dark chocolate waft up to meet the nose. This is a sipping-by-the-fire beer, savor layers of malt and hops as they unfold on the palate. The 10.5 ABV is well hidden and no hint of alchohol hotness. Ultra-smooth, this is not the boozy Imperial IPA of the wanna-be breweries. Founders does this one justice. Delicious and seek it out.

I mean let's face it founders does stouts amazingly well with the lineup that includes KBS, Breakfast Stout CBS in this bad boy. I'm actually lucky enough to be rating a two year aged on this one. Pours looking like vintage black ink in body hosting a short half an inch of deep caramel brown head that fades to a skim quickly. Knows reminds me of chocolate liqor and black licorice. With first step of this beer I am always amazed at how well the flavors all meld together. You get black licorice dark chocolate and black strap molasses all-in-one. Really for a baseline imperial stout it is near perfection on flavor. This beer would take gorgeously to being Bourbon barrel aged. Hint hint founders please give us Bourbon barrel aged Imperial stout, I know everybody else is doing it but this would be a thing of beauty. This beer is an absolute classic and a benchmark for Imperial Stout's.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 BLACK body, dark mocha head. I'm comparing the pour to a black background, and it is still starkly black. Aroma is deep, with dark chocolate, charred and toasted malt, a fair amount of earthy and piney hops, and some alcohol burn. The flavor is decidedly acidic and bitter; lots of hop resins, roasted malt, baker's chocolate, alcohol. Thick, full body, yet moderately carbonated.  It's big, but misses the mark for me. Too much acidity, which while within the appropriate range for the style, detracts from any warmth of the other flavors. Also too highly carbonated, and too much presence of pure alcohol; boozy is good, ethanol is not, even when it's faint. Maybe with some age this would mellow out into my preferences, but as of now it is not a favorite.

Dark chocolate. Caramel. Faint hint of alcohol.     Tongue  Big hit of roasted malts. Dense layers of cocoa, espresso, caramel, and charred toast. Mild hint of bitterness, similar to the acidic bitterness in coffee and dark chocolate. Finished warm.     Mouthfeel  Dense. Full-bodied. Chewy at times. Low carbonation.    Notes  Remarkable RIS. Founders did an excellent job of showcasing the naturally sweet characteristics of an imperial stout without making the brew a sugar bomb. I cannot recommend this beer enough!

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 I am not sure how a stout could look any more appetizing -deep black color; thick - I've poured motor oil with less viscosity; nice tan head with significant lacing (or my glass is real dirty -- will give Founders the benefit of the doubt). Subdued nose - dark chocolate and malts. Taste - straight forward excellence -- not a lot of extra frills, but what this beer does, it does exceptionally well; like the nose, dark chocolate and malts, exceptional bitterness (yes the 75 IBU comes through). Mouth feel is silky smooth, nice carbonation, and a lingering bitterness (see 75 IBU again); high ABV masked a bit -- I think this one could catch up with you. Overall -- this is a truly outstanding Imperial Stout. Yet another example of Founders showing their expertise with dark beers.

First thing I noted was how viscous this monster of a stout is! Poured a thick, deep, dark brown with a 1-2 finger dark tan head. Smells of roasted malts (duh). Thick and creamy on the palate. Took my time drinking this one as it is VERY filling. Felt pretty good once the 10.5% ABV kicked in. A good brew to enjoy on a cold winter's eve. Thanks Founders!!

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 Poured 12 oz bottle into snifter glass. 10.5% abv    Appearance- Pours a coal black with a two finger bark brown head that dissipates fast. Quite opaque.    Smell- Earthy. Roasted, sweet malt. Chocolate and licorice aromas.    Taste- A heavily roasted malt up front. Some chocolate mixed in with the malt flavor. A smoky flavor fills the palate. Mocha towards the finish. This stout finishes extremely bitter.    Mouthfeel- Extra thick/heavy bodied. Low carbonation.    Overall- Alright. Not as complex as I thought it would be considering it used ten different malts. This stout was also unusually bitter for it being fresh. It detracted from the smoothness. I would say this would be much better if aged a year or two.

Tastes sweet malts forward, mid note of unsweetened cocoa, expresso, smoky/leathery, hint of barnyard/wet burlap, and nice piney twang as the final note with a bit of alcohol tingle and fairly clean finish with just a bit of sweet malty tackiness that lingers pleasantly (like a sweet port or sherry). Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with enough carbonation to keep it from becoming syrupy and just the right amount of alcohol to add a tingle and warmth.  Solid imperial stout .

Not overpowering.     Huge, chewy stout. Minimal carbonation and very balanced bitterness. Pretty sweet but very drinkable. Not sure how they got this 2014 keg, but it's awesome.     Overall this is everything it's hyped up to be. If you've got some fresh ones I would vote for letting it age a year or so; the payoff is tremendous.

Leaves some foam behind but not much lacing. Smell is of roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate. Also a smell of ethanol which isn't exactly a want of mine for beer. The taste and mouthfeel is awesome, no alcohol burn or taste. Lots of roastiness and chocolate. Hints of coffee. The mouthfeel is spectacular and I appreciate that there isnt a sweetness lingering, but instead it finishes dry and robust.

It has the thick, motor oil look you'd expect from a top-tier stout, but I can't remember the last time I've seen this kind of head on a beer. It's at least a full inch of foam, thick with tiny bubbles, and it's dark brown. As it settles, it leaves a ton of lacing on the glass and lightens in color, settling into a thin, tan-colored layer with some larges bubbles around the edge. If you swirl it around, you can see a million tiny bubbles marching through the legs.  The smell is initially all roasted malt with some coffee and cocoa notes. Unfortunately, if the beer is served too cold (straight out of a standard refrigerator), the smell fades quickly.  The flavor is coffee, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and smoke, all under a layer of slight hoppy bitterness. As it warms, the finish seems to become lighter and less bitter.  It's smooth and somewhat chewy, but it does not have the viscosity I expected from the way it looked when poured.  A beautifully well-made imperial stout.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Founders Imperial Stout hits all of the points for me when I think of "Imperial Stout" without going completely out of bounds on any one area or being a gimmick beer.     Look - Pours a deep dark brown with a caramel mocha colored foam. The pour gives you an accurate impression of the beer you're about to drink.    Smell - Bittersweet Chocolate with coffee and vanilla notes. Deep roasted malts.    Taste - Deep and complex layers of roast of the chocolate and coffee notes with definite charred notes all blend together to be nearly indistinguishable unless tasting it for a review purpose. There is just enough caramel sweetness to balance the roast and the hops do there job to add enough bitterness to check the caramel. There is a very slight hint of alcohol heat in the finish, but I'm being very, very picky on this. Your average BA won't notice it.     What I love most about this beer is that it's not a roast bomb, a hop bomb or a cloying mess. It dials up all of those attributes in just the right level to create a harmonious, delicious beer.    Feel - Lucious and creamy matching and enhancing everything that the beer has offered to this point.    I don't review many beers, but this beer simply deserves it. A fantastic beer that I will buy every time that I see it.

Into my Sam Adams glass (thanks, guys!) this one redefines “engine oil black.” Gorgeous, glossy black color with a thick, 1-2 finger head of dark brown and tan head of fine bubbles. Great retention with a thick cap and collar and plenty of gooey lacing all the way down. Nose is complex with sweet toasted malt with vanilla notes up front, boozy alcohol, powdered cocoa, roasted coffee and perhaps licorice. On the tongue it’s a perfect balance of heavy body and bubbly effervescence. Milky, creamy, but with enough carbonation to give some bite. Flavor is big dark chocolate up front tempered by charred coffee and backed by a heavy boozy note. Wraps up on a nice bitter burn; my only real complaint is that the bitter aftertaste hangs around long enough to make this a one-beer trip.     Overall a really solid RIS. Is this top tier? Maybe. I’m really partial to huge Belgian beers like quads, but this offering is very solid for style. Detract points for a slight lack of drinkability.

Pours a midnight black, bitter sweet malty nose.  Tastes of bittersweet chocolate, and malts. Mouthfeel is rich and decadent... Stellar beer!!    I have to say, I do prefer the Breakfast Stout, but that's only because I love coffee notes in my porters/stouts.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 The beer known as Founders Imperial Stout, pours thicker than an Olympic weight lifters thigh. The sheer mass of this beer pouring into the snifter comes down harder than John Cena's fist on The Big Shows skull at a Texas monster truck rally in July. The color of this beer is darker than the farthest depths of the bayou during the witching hour.     It is by the good grace of the Lord that I survived the interaction between this beer and myself.     While pouring this beer, the aromas spill into the air like the Exxon Mobile Oil spill back in March of '89. The abrupt force of raisins, and dark matter explodes like an atomic bomb and wipe everything out in its path. My humble abode, now turned into ruins. Ashes scatter, teeth chatter, children yelping, ears ringing. Slowly going in and out of consciousness. Instant headache, and incredible pains pulsing through my bones. The Apocalypse has finally arrived. "DEAR GOD! SAVE THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN!"     It was as if I had been taken back in time and placed right in the heart of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. I had been dropped in at peak action in the destruction of Pompeii. History is always doomed to repeat itself, but who knew that it would be brought on by this almighty beer? Not I! For only an evil, wicked mind, could conjure such a concoction, and have the meat to release it!     I search for direction but the mighty ash has blocked out the sunlight. I look to my left, and far in the distance I see the chalice of beer that single handedly brought forward this madness! There is only one way to stop this. I must consume it.    Forward I run! "Faster! FASTER!!!" I scold myself to get ever nearer towards this drink. 78 paces I glide! Weaving through the chaos of falling structures I reach the vessel. I aggressively grab the glass. Splashes of the unholy liquid fall to the ground, poisoning the Earth for eternity. With the most stoic of hearts, I take one for the universe. The fate of all mankind grasps me by the shoulders and performs a death roll, taught by the ancient crocodiles from the times of old. Ripping me limb from limb I continue to drink this beer. Like the heart of Jeffery Dahmer, this beer begins to consume me!     Gasping for air I know it is too late to quit. I reluctantly tip the chalice ever so slightly to finish the last soul devouring drop! Instantly I collapse. Begging for the Lord to save me, a silence falls over the town. The ash begins to settle. The cries of children deplete. Now laying face down, dirt begins to cling on to my stout thickened lips.     Just then, THE ALMIGHTY LORD SWOOPS DOWN playing a drum set made of FIRE that burns from the evil souls of those he has conquered! Neal Peart stands behind the Lord coaching him in his drum solo techniques. Landing next to me like the Apollo 11 from 1969, God, and Mr. Peart wave their drums sticks around creating a tornado of dust, ash, and flame around us. With one gentle tap of the drum sticks to my lips, I am born again. I have a new lease on life!    I am carried skywards towards the heavens! Forgiven and thanked for taking on this mighty task, the lord, Neil Peart and I perform a trifecta of a High-Five! The shock wave from this, spreads throughout the land and wipes away all wreckage, and destruction from the Earth's crust.    That. That right there. Is what it is like to consume this beer.

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Pours motor oil black. Just black. Black. An angry reddish brown head forms and sticks around for a great while, and lace is everywhere. Hilly and beautiful.    Smells like a Russian Imperial Stout should. Heavy booze, chocolate, charred malts, hop bittering, and coffee at the end of the nose, followed by more booze.     Heavy chocolate notes, with boozy plum and black licorice, raisins, followed with coffee. The booze cuts straight through the flavor though, and burns the profile a bit too much. Some nail polish. Breaths are boozy raisins/grapes and coffee bean.     Feel is huge, dry, and has a sandpaper roughness. None of this is bad, just objective.     Overall impressions : It's not the best RIS I've had, because the booze cuts a bit too much and burns out some of the flavors. Still, it won't keep me from buying a 4-pack in the future. A solid RIS, but maybe a little less enjoyable than Old Rasputin, Expedition, and Plead the 5th.

It's just an ultimate imperial stout, and something I have enjoyed from the first time I had it to the present day. Even as my palate evolves, my love of this beer never changes.

Anyway, this is a stellar offering. Pours super dark black. Smell is bitter, sweet, roasty malt. Taste is decadent chocolate, bittersweet cocoa, caramel, malt. Feel is super rich. Overall: i dunno why people go nuts over Breakfast Stout....this right here is the real McCoy

Looks jet black and delicious. The nose is full of roasted malts and chocolate, a bit of burnt brown sugar, and even a hint of dark fruit. The taste hits hard with those roasted malts, a bit of the chocolate comes through. It finishes with a slight bitterness that rounds out the overall taste very well. Mouthfeel is thick, carbonated and milky. I paired this banana bread and went bananas (sorry about that). A delightful pairing for a fantastic beer.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 2013 version, aged two years. Pours black with a small brownish head, somewhat of a thick viscosity. The head quickly disappears and leaves a little soapy lacing. The odor for me is powerful, rich, chocolate, creamy, vanilla, slight coffee, roasted notes, cocoa, slight dry wood note. The taste for me is velvety, creamy, bitter chocolate, coffee bean, nutty, vanilla, dry, slightly metallic, woods. Slight bitterness, but mostly dry finish.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 4.25 Viscous, glossy and ominous dark black with a convex, dark mocha head like a still rising souffle top.    Smell is very roasty dark malt, almost smokey like hickory, and right on the edge of being burnt but not, with molasses and salty roasted nuts.    On the tongue, the roast levels are very bold, especially for the original release date of FIS--almost all other direct competitors of this beer on the self are far lighter and less potent. The taste is god damn ultra roasty dark malt, almost like sea salted caramel, with dark chocolate, coffee, and roasted almonds.    The body is surprisingly moderate and slick, not heavy or dense like you'd imagine. It also has a light carbonation level despite the large round head, finishing dry, almost tangy and a little boozy.

Not much head, just a dark tan film and ring around the rim. Blacker than black body, no light coming through. Mmmm.    Smell: Lots and lots of rich dark chocolate, roast malt, yum.    Taste: Oh wow! There's still a good amount of bitterness here that carries the smooth chocolatey caramel flavors nicely. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, some dark roast coffee on the finish. There's no hint of alcohol, this is like a chocolate milkshake.    Feel: I think this might be thicker than Ten Fidy. Great full-bodied beer, but the lively bitterness and rich flavors really come together perfectly here.     Overall: Bummed that this is my last '14 bottle, but very pleased that I got to enjoy it. One of the best stouts out there, BA or otherwise.

The color is the epitome of black and looks incredibly thick and chewy, topped with a rocky, dark brown head. The aroma is very roasty, charred dark malts, earthy hops, unsweetened chocolate, some dark fruits, black coffee roast, burnt caramel, and a little vanilla. Mouth feel is thick and creamy with a touch of chalkiness, luscious is a word that comes to mind. Flavor is full of bittersweet chocolate, burnt coffee, stale hops, dark caramel, oak. More of the bitter roast bomb than a sticky sugary mess.

Feels smooth and creamy, thick bodied with light carbonation. Great tasting, super chocolatey, and just strong enough without being boozy. Overall a really great imperial stout.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Edit 12/15/2017: At three years old, it is still amazing, yet there is a small amount of chalky taste in the finish.    Edit 2/26/2016: Incredible! I am increasing taste, feel & overall.    12oz, bottled 12/2/2014, snifter used. Pours dark like any other stout, with a small but robust light-chocolate colored head, nice lacing, and good body when swirled. Aroma is strong on the booze but complex with chocolate and some port wine notes. I taste LOTS of chocolate, some burnt/roasted notes, and again, booze, although it is quite smooth on the finish.    I started writing this review when I first tried this beer, and finished the review as I sipped on the last of it (hours later). I expected a lot out of the beer, and it delivered: it is one of the best RIS I have had, with plenty of complexity. I hope to buy some to lay down and see how it fares with a couple of years age on it.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Poured at cellar temp with a small, long lasting brown head and some lace. Aroma is cocoa, coffee, anise, leather, old furniture. Flavor's like nose, with bitter dominating sweet and tang. Finishes with cocoa. Very smooth palate. Too easy drinking for its strength.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Bottled 12/15/14 Enjoyed on 9/29/15    Pours a dark like purple/black color with brown head. Head did not retain well. The smell is very complex; cacao, stone fruits, and some coffee notes. Graham cracker aromas shows up as the beer warms. The flavor is very heavy on dark chocolate and roast. This is a very viscous and full bodied beer. Still a little boozy too. Overall, this is a great RIS. I would like to revisit this one with some more age on it.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Look:  Pours like motor oil (thick and syrupy). Pitch black with no light shining through. A bit low on carbonation (only about a 1 finger head).     Smell:   Smells of chocolate and caramel with slight smokey coffee scent. Smells like a decadent dessert!     Taste:  There is a huge bitter bite of hops at first, but is quickly diminished by strong smoked malt, chocolate, caramel, and coffee. There is a slight sourness at the beginning, but then the sweet syrupy flavors quickly flow in. As the flavors start to fade, smokiness remains and the beer finishes a bit dry.    Feel:  Very thick and full bodied. Feels quite thick and oily/syrupy. Slight dry feel at finish.    Overall:  This is an awesome brew. I am impressed with how flavorful and full the beer is. It also packs quite a punch at 10.5%. I would highly recommend this one, but don't down one of these on a full stomach as it is almost a meal on its own.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 For me, this is the ne plus ultra shelf stout, and one of the absolute best period. Darker, deeper, richer, and more complex than so many of the barrel-aged examples I've tried, you overlook it at your peril. It is, and will always be, an all-time classic in the style. The malt bill, in particular, exudes genius.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a bottle into pint glass in September 2015.    Appearance: Dark black with a thick tan/brown head. Head is thick, and sticks to the glass.    Smell: Strong aroma of roasted coffee and malts. There is some hoppiness and a hint of sweetness like chocolate as well, but overall the roasted coffee dominate the others. Comparing this to Founder's Breakfast Stout, it has a stronger alcohol aroma, and much less coffee aroma.    Taste: There is a nice balance between the malts and roasted coffee flavors. There is some chocolate and hop flavors to enhance the taste and add some complexity. There is a strong alcohol presence as with other RISs. Comparing this to Founder's Breakfast Stout, the imperial has less coffee flavor and more bite from the hops.    Mouth-feel: Very thick, but with a smooth creamy bodied. Not as biting as some other RISes. Comparing this to Founder's Breakfast Stout the Imperial is thicker and heavier.    This is a typically strong RIS, but it has a variety of flavors that adds a nice complexity to the beer. Although this is a big beer, it is smooth and really enjoyable to drink. Overall one of my favorite RIS, and another beer from Founders that it on the top of my list of favorites.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 As I score this, I'm realizing that I'm giving this a higher score than Expedition stout, which I've generally labeled my favorite non-BA stout. Well, so be it.    Bottling date is 12-22-14. Aged eight-plus months in my basement. Pour is of a serious motor oil quality. I mean that. That character seems to too frequently get thrown around for RISs, but it's not always true. This is a thick pour, period. Body matches. Taste is roast, malt, with chocolate undertones.     Ultimately, I think this is far superior to the KBS and is very underrated. This is a beer that needs several months of aging though, so one should give this time when it is attained. It is everything an RIS should be.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Nice, black color, with an attractive brown head that lasts not nearly as long as I would expect. Decent lacing retention, though. Smell is dominated by as slightly spicy, roasted-malt aroma, with notes of chocolate, coffee, and hints of molasses and hoppy spiciness. Flavors are roasty and fairly dry: bittersweet chocolate, African dark-roast coffee, black-strap molasses, and hints of bourbon, berries, plums, raisins, carob, and even more chocolate and coffee on the fairly dry finish. Nice balance of carbonation level and rich, full body. Excellent, and a great value; please keep it up, Founders!

S: Roasty, malts, caramel, some molasses and coffee. A nice nose.    T: The taste is where it is at with this one. There is a lovely blend of coffee, chocolate and roasts right up front, with a sweet molasses/treacle and vanilla middle and a good bitter finish.    M: Remarkably smooth with a full body and moderate carbonation.    O: Founders doesn't disappoint on this one, its reputation is well earned. A fine example of a RIS that is easy to sip and enjoy. The flavors just bounce around in your mouth making this one you want to sip slowly to enjoy a little longer.

Head color is very dark, looks like burnt butter in a skillet. Smell is like chocolate and vanilla soft-serve with a kahlua chaser. Sits in your mouth like double fudge cookies dunked in coffee. The finale is alcohol and vanilla and the contemplation of whether drinking straight maple syrup would be as thick as this.

Smell of coffee, vanilla, a bit of caramel, some roasted malt, and a tiny bit of chocolate. Taste is coffee, chocolate, heavy roasted malt, very bitter, and a bit of caramel and vanilla on the end.
