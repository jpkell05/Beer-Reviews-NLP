look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 From notes 3/31/13: Pours a clear pale amber producing 3 fingers of billowy, foamy, off-whit, nicely lasting head that leaves nice rings and webs of lace. Aroma is bitter grapefruit heaven, light pine resin, rye spice, caramel, and tropical fruits with some lemon. Taste is similar with the caramel more distinct but wrapped in fruit layers of orange, pineapple and grapefruit backed up by hop and rye spice and a hint of pepper in the finish. Very Lagunitas style hoppiness. The hops have a fresh or "green" taste. There is a nicely lasting fruity but bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little heavy, slightly oily and slick it is also slightly creamy and very smooth. Very, very pleasant. I need more of this.

It has the sweetness of Brown Shugga alright, but it also has that rich smell of citrusness coming from the likes of Sumpin' Ale. For me it would be Sumpin Ale > This > Brown Shugga, but only by really close (0.1 point difference) range. Overall a great beer, didn't know Lagunitas was this great.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12 Oz Bottle poured into glass  Look - mostly clear, golden or light amber color, thick head of foam that slowly fades down and leaves lots of lacing  Smell - very floral and sweet. Aroma of malty biscuit, sugar grass, tropical sweet fruit, and various flowers  Taste - A very malt-forward beer with the hops in the background. Not as sweet tasting as the smell and that i believe is a good thing, i don't want it too sweet. Notes of citrus, pine resin, flowery herbs, sourdough bread, and grass. Alcohol is certainly picked up at the 8% ABV but i don't mind and i expect it to be present. Carbonation is medium and body is medium-full.    Overall, packs a flavor punch and i really like it. It tastes fresh and is well balanced. I could probably drink only one of these in a sitting, a decent dessert beer or along those lines. For those wondering how it compares to other Lagunitas beer, the only IPA i would prefer over this is Hop Stoopid. I give it a grade of A

But I can not say clear and crisp.   Will try again.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a bottle into a glass.     Overall: a big, hoppy, quality DIPA. Feel and look are tops, but not as malty as I would have liked.     Looks great with a dark gold color, viscous skim head, and sticky lacing. Smell was packed with bright, citrusy hops. No particular graininess. Taste followed with bitter, rind-like hops upfront, in the middle, and in the finish. The malt character was hiding on this one. Great feel. A little sticky. Smooth.

I couldn't believe this was an IPA because the bitterness wasn't very high because it was so well balanced.     The taste is high. I wondered how..did this guy achieve the low bitterness??? Maybe added sugar at the end??? Great beer. Will be buying Lagunitas continuously for life most likely (unless it's Heineken owners switch it to cheap low quality product)   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.75 When I poured an ice cold Lagunitas Sucks beer into my glass, I was excited to get to tasting. It’s look had a honey yellow hue. The smell was a delicious piney orange. But the problem is it just didn’t have much flavor. Yes the hops were tangy. But that’s about it. To me, it tasted like grapefruit juice mixed with water. It has a light feel to it, which is ok. I prefer full bodied, but wouldn’t necessarily discount a beer if the flavor was there. However, with this beer, lacking it’s flavor, I can’t give it high marks.

Another quality offering from lagunitas with a bit of their classic twang that they seem to throw into every beer.   S: Light brown sugar smell at first finishing with a slight sweet, muffin like smell with a faint hoppiness at the tail end  L: Nearly the color of apple juice, but not quite light enough to see through. Cloudier than most give credit  T: Brown sugar up front with a biscuity flavor that carries through the middle while finishing with a piny, slightly spicy hoppy flavor. Goes down CRAZY smooth. Certainly an easy drinker for a hot day or even a day in the house.  F: This is an 8.. although it is an easy drinker, it is not to be taken lightly!  definitely a go-to for any IPA lover   Cheers

After trying that beer it made me want to try "Lagunitas Sucks".    The problem with IPAs is that they are too bitter (IBUs are too high). But Lagunitas is smart, they aren't trying to get into the IBU arms race that other beer companies have gotten into with their IPAs.    The key to their success is the fact that they are blending their hops with wheat and other backbones. It gives you a much smoother profile to the beer that is much easier on your palette. I think I like this beer even more than A Little Sumpin' Sumpin'. Very nicely brewed. Nice head on the beer, lacing, the smell and color is nice and the mouthfeel is just right. The flavor reminds me of A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' but more refined and smoother.    Now my review might not be as accurate as possible because I did have my bottle in the cellar for awhile. According to the julian date stamp on my bottle it says: 075 6 which I believe means that was bottled on the 75th day of the year 2016. It is 6/8/18 today. LOL, my bottle is two years old. The moral of the story is that if it tastes this good after two years... maybe that's the way to drink this beer. It is so damn smooth but hoppy. I want to try a fresh one just to compare. I'm not sure I'd like a fresh one as much as I like one that's two years old. It ages very well.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a tall clear glass. Hazy, dark amber-golden color. Finger thick fluffy head. Moderate carbonation.    Smell is piney and citrusy upfront. Orange, pineapple, and grapefruit, other tropical hops, a caramel scent, other floral hops, resin, and sweet bread malt.    Much like the aroma. Hops and malts compete with each other. Pine and resin spicy hops that make up the body of the beer, followed by citrus and sweet flavors like pineapple, tangerine, mango, stone fruit, orange, caramel, and honey. Mildly bitter aftertaste. Feels smooth.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 May 10th, 2015 - I can't remember if I had this beer before or after visiting Lagunitas, but all the same, it's a sassy and boozy brew, just in line with the brewery's branding (and pre-sale attitude.) Beautifully amber with just a slight haze from the chill, it has a high, bright and hoppy aroma. The flavor is sweet with rich hits of brown sugar and cinnamon and a light booziness, but the palate is light and very drinkable. This is a brew to approach with caution. Easy drinking and high ABV make for a potent concoction.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 5/5/18: $1.66 12 oz bottle poured into chalice. Golden tan pour, light white head and lacing. Hops aroma offset by sweet fruit, mango, citrus and tangerine. Nice hops taste, completely balanced by sweet citrus and tangerine taste, sweeter than most IPAs. Carbonation holds, thin mouth feel, smooth drinking. Overall good offering.

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Picked up 2 6-packs from Curtis Liquors in Cohasset, MA. I've been working through a list of 20 beers that are supposed to be like Heady Topper. So far, NOTHING is like Heady Topper, but this is one damn good beer.    Looks mildly hazy. Once I took a sip it didn't last long enough for me to stare.    Smells very hopped and also has something sweet and tropical to it. Like pineapple or mango instead of citrusy things. Whatever it is, it all blends into a scent that makes the nostrils sing and not in the "Oy crap, I've got the Spanish flu" way.    Taste is just ridiculous. Out of this world. Take the sweet but thick pine scent and add brown bread but the real kind and not the stuff from a can soaked with syrup. You get a big hoppy nose, bit of fruit, and a smooth but slightly bitter twist and the flavor just stays the same the whole time. Spectacular.    Mouthfeel almost like a cream ale met an English bitters, called it a truce and invited their friend Witch Hazel out to play. Smooth and mildly astringent, so the taste buds don't get muddied up and the next one tastes as good as the last.    Overall superb. Need to get more, just as soon as I get through this case of Galaxy High by Madtree Brewing.

To me, this beer would be just fine if it wasn't over-hopped. Taste isn't that bad just a tad too bitter for my liking.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 I am always looking for something different and decided to try this since I like everything else I’ve had from Lagunitas. Very slight haze to a golden yellow color. It doesn’t really taste like a double IPA, very good balance of malt to hops. I didn’t detect the expected citrus notes but a solid pine bitter note with the faintest citrus coming from behind. There is an almost indescribable flavor on the back end that I can only describe as a single lick of a “bracht Carmel”. It’s not sweet, but it spurs the memory. It’s very enjoyable, as Chris Knight plays “down the river” on iHeartRadio. Too bad Houston fall weather consist of 90 degree plus temps. Hopefully it’ll cool off soon.

"Lagunitas Sucks Brown Shugga' Substitute Ale"  12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, production coded but without freshness dating  $2 @ Weis, Conshohocken, PA    Notes via stream of consciousness: Well this is lighter than I was expecting, I must have been confusing it with something else although I've definitely had it before on tap. I generally don't like to do reviews in bars though, there are too many different smells going on, and too many distractions. So, OK, it's a hazy golden and there's visible particulate in suspension. I'll assume that's yeast, I saw it come out of the bottle towards the end. Ahh, it just occurred to me that maybe I thought it was darker because it appeared that way at the bar. Anyway, the head is a creamy off-white which has already dropped to a thin surface covering and wide collar. I have a beer clean glass, by the way, I used it earlier so I'm not sure what the problem here is. The aroma displays a grainy, lightly caramelish malt with citrusy fruits and a bit of pine. It's clean and fresh and welcoming. The flavor follows and I'm finding notes of orange, light brown sugar, sweetened grapefruit, pineapple, and soft pine. It's not particularly bitter given the amount of sweet bread malt that's there, but it comes through, particularly in the finish. It's sweetish upfront but balanced in the end. Some citrus and pine lingers. It's definitely medium in body, almost medium-full, and the carbonation is fairly soft leaving it gently tingly on the tongue and then smooth. Nicely done. I'm not even finding the alcohol, what is it? 8% ABV, that's not a bad trick to pull off. Quite pleasant and enjoyable; I'll have to pick up some more.

Hops are soft, Chinook might be in there, something like but not Citra. A bit like Surly's Abrasive.     Thick-ish, low carb plays right.

You may notice some pineapple, caramel, malts and an earthy bitterness. The finish was great with a creamy medium end.   Overall a great addition to their body of work.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 12 oz bottle with no date, says 8% ABV (not 7.85%).  Wow! Pours amber-tinted golden, moderate white head with sticky lacing. Incredibly balanced aromas of nectarine and peach, tangerine and a little orange and ripe grapefruit, warm tropicals, just a tad lemon, some pine, a tad dank, mostly sweet. Taste is hop forward and bitter but incredibly balanced, with pine resin and grapefruit, orange, tropical fruit, some stone fruit, with a sweetness that cuts through the resinous hops. All the components line up humbly in their place, waiting for you to explore them, never overstepping, and creating a symphony on the palate. Feel is medium bodied, creamy enough. Finish is a pleasant variety of bitter, a combination of dryness with citrus peel freshness.  I loved this beer to the point that it may be better than Pliny. So happy to have found it!

Flavors follow the citrus theme - pineapple, lemon, and banana. Some white pepper spice on the finish. Crisp polished finish. some alcohol.    A bit atypical for a DIPA - but par for the course for lagunitas, but crisp and clean and hits enough marks to go back to it.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 From a 355ml bottle served at 13 degrees Celsius into a snifter. The bottle has been aged (slightly unintentionally) for more than six months.    Look: The beer pours a clear amber with 4cm of off-white, creamy, dense head that settles into a craggy cap after 4+ minutes.    Smell: Moderate strength and well-balanced with hops and malts competing for attention. Notes of citrus (orange and grapefruit), floral hops, tropical fruit, and resinous pine. Some honey and a touch of soapiness.    Taste: Follows the aroma seamlessly. American/New World hops with notes of orange, grapefruit, pine, tropical fruit, and honey. The finish is quite long, strong, and bitter. Medium-dry and definitely not harsh.    Feel: Medium-full body with moderate carbonation. Creamy with restrained alcohol warmth.    Overall: An outstanding beer with malts providing a fabulous backbone for the delicious hops. Very drinkable for an imperial IPA. Along the lines of Dogfish 90 Minute IPA - I'd be interested in trying these back to back. How I wish this was commonly available in Canada.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 The appearance is a light orange/yellow colored yet somewhat hazy body, foamy white head appears and dies to a film coating the top of the beer. Some nice rings are left sticking to the sides of the chalice. The smell is an abundance of grapefruit up front backed up nicely by some light lime, lemon and pine. It comes across very strong as the beer sits on my coaster less than a foot away from my nose and I can still smell it. Some other hops are there but not as intrusive as the grapefruit ones. The malts are there slightly. The taste is bitter and eventually gets slightly sweet as the beer warms. The grapefruit is tasted all the way down. The palate is about a medium but doesn’t come across that sessionable with a sticky aftertaste, and gets slightly syrupy and the finish is dry, The ABV is hidden well. Overall, pretty nicely done DIPA well worthy of my time.

Just my thing. Two fingers of off white head that turns rocky as it settles. Lasts for a while. Decent lacing.     Hits the nose with the IPA signature big bold hops. Citrus, pine and ripe white grapefruit. Some sweet malts that form a good backbone to support the hoppy goodness. Resinous pine builds on the palate sip after sip. Not boozy at all. Perfect carbonation rounds out the medium mouthfeel.    Very drinkable. Sessional. I could drink this brew all day long. Just plain tastes good! Cheers.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Talk about a happy accident. Lagunitas was unable to produce its popular Brown Sugga in 2010, and came up with this as a compensation for their fans. In my opinion, this is their best brew. It is a totally complete beer, hence my 5 rating. This is one of the very best beers I have ever had.    Look- Beautiful, transparent, amber body. The head is snow-white an holds up quite well.    Smell- This may be the best feature of this beer. Pineapple and mango hit the nose right away. You can detect just a little malt. This aroma is exceptionally appetizing.    Taste- The pineapple/mango carry over. Rather than tang or sweetness, there is a dry bitterness and a medium overall strength. Amazingly, you can't detect the 7.85 % ABV.      Mouthfeel- Crisp and clean. Slightly astringent. Finish is also clean with just a little creaminess. Aftertaste is a lingering and mildly bitter.    Overall- Anyone who reads my reviews can easily tell that I am partial to stouts. If I am going to consider varying my routine, this would be my first consideration, hands down. This is a unique brew that is a must-try for ale or IPA fans. Additionally, certain beers to which I have given all 5s or really close to such have had inconsistent batching issues. I have, therefore, reduced my overall ratings for them. This particular beer has always maintained the same level of quality, and this also helps earn it a perfect score.

Creamy and medium at least in mouthfeel.

Taste follows suit with good hop bitterness to the finish. Slightly creamy and medium bodied with moderate carbonation.    Overall a good DIPA. Tasty and refreshing. Recommended!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 I can't believe some of the reviews of this beer. I guess since it is labeled an imperial IPA, the snobs write the review based on that?    To me it doesn't taste like anything I have had before and that is a GOOD thing. Such a clean mouth feel, no bitter hop explosion like most "Imperial IPA's. I wouldn't classify it as that. It is a unique beer with it's own classification and it is a GOOD one.    Will be buying again, and frequently.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Look: Pours a clear golden orange color with a one finger, off white head of foam that laces the glass well.    Aroma: Clementine, tangerine, grapefruit, sticky pine resin, honey and a touch of mango.    Taste: Malty. Slightly tropical with a subtle bitterness. . . I'm getting restrained notes of spicy pine sap upfront that quickly transitions into flavors of brown sugar, sugar cookies, honey and caramel. There are also notes of sweet tropical fruits like pineapple, tangerine, mango and orange.    Feel: Full bodied with low carbonation. Creamy. Sweet throughout, somewhat spicy.    Overall: This is classified as an Imperial IPA but it drinks like a strong Amber Ale. . . It's so malty and sweet I don't really know if my bottle is just old or if the beer is intended to taste like this. Not bad but not great. Malt driven flavors backed up by subtle spicy notes of hops and notes of juicy tropical fruit. Not sure if I would buy this again, or if I would call it an Imperial IPA.    Edit: Lmao. . . I guess I hurt the reviewer above my posts feelings since he's insinuating that because I didn't fall head over heels for a beer he likes it makes me a ""beer snob"" . . . Never said this is a shitty beer, but oh well, what can I say? My opinion stands, this really isn't that great of an Imperial IPA in my opinion.    And yes person I am talking about; for the record, I do write my reviews based on what style the brewery categorizes the beer under. . . if it's labeled double IPA I expect it to be bitter not sweet.

Light head and light copper color when poured with little carbonation/bubbles coming up from the glass. Hoppy smell and taste, but a nice touch of malts on top. This has a fairly bitter taste moreover with a high IBU content. I did not like this too much the last time I tried it but I have become more of a hop head as I try new beers. Also for a world class rating for this site, it's a nice deal at $8.50 a six pack compared to other world classers, if you can get them, at over $12.00.

I'm personally not a big fan of hop-explosions, so this was a good beer for me.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.75 This is what I would call a light IPA. Though it's not an IPA it gives you the crispy fruity hops and just the right amount malt . This beer is golden with a soft bitter citrusy after taste. This beer is dangerous as at 8% ABV it will creep up on you. A soft pine earthy aroma with a light yet fluffy head ,that gives it a nice smooth fizz.   On a scale of 1 to 10 this beer is a solid 9.5 so far the best beer I've had in 2016

I prefer the original Brown Shugga.     AROMA: Pine, wood, sap.  LOOK: Clear yellow. Small white head.  TASTE: Hoppy, pine, bitter resin. Lots of flavor, but not necessarily good flavor.    **

But, it is borderline false advertising to even reference brown shugg. that is a wonderful, but different drink. This and that are the not the same AT ALL. The only connection is, they did not have the ingredients to make an amber ale, so they made a pale. ? Brown shugga is awesome. If you like Pales, listen to the other guys that like this. I drank this as the second beer after I drank a dark beer that I actually like. Rating is in protest.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25 Picked up a 6 pack from the LCBO for about $16 CDN. Served cold into a chalice. This rendition advertised as 8% ABV.    Appearance - Pours a bright, light orange colored beer with two thirds of a finger of white head. Medium retention and some curtains of lace left around the edges of the glass. Greta clarity and prevalent carbonation in the beer.    Smell - Mango with some citrus hops, little bits of grapefruit and pineapple. Some cereal grains for balance, much more so than many a DIPA.    Taste - Light with mango, grapefruit and some pineapple. Lots of grains too for balance and a light caramel malt. Doesn't wow me, but drinakbility is huge.    mouthfeel - Slightly drying finish, booze is hidden wonderfully and probably one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had.    Overall - Overrated in terms of flavor, but underrated in terms of easy this is to drink especially for an 8% ABV beer. Really good stuff and worth a try. Certainly looking forward to buying another 6 pack, while in stock as this is dangerously easy to drink. Definitely doesn't suck.

The taste is wonderful, lots of fruits bursting in, hops, oat, dank notes, pine. The finish is light and clean, really nice beer. The bite is very mild and light dryness. Overall this beer is great all around, it is just perfect with regard to taste and strength. Pretty awesome.

I'm a sucker for the scent of grainy wort, and for a friggin Double IPA, this has all the oatmealy goodness you'd catch walking by a brewery during the early morning phases of a day's first batch. All the breadiness of the nose interplays with juicy, citrusy hops that pucker more than bitter. If that makes sense. No? Yeah, didn't think so. Anyway, the taste follows the aroma. A great intermingle of cereal grains and bright, grassy hops. I want to pat these guys on the shoulder, reassuring that they're probably being too hard on themselves. Wink Wink. Lagunitas may suck, but this beer certainly does not.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Pours a very clear dark amber with a large head that quickly reduces to a half-inch foam with nice lacing. Aroma is a hop slap on the face. Intense pine, citrus and some dank. Taste is very similar, with the bitterness being balanced by some nice malt sweetness. Very well balanced despite the strong hop profile. This is a seriously fun DIPA, as long as you got it fresh.

The fruitiness of the hops plays around with some esters from the quirky yeast  F: Extremely smooth and creamy. The extra grains really thicken it up.  O: This is a really interesting beer. It's definitely a departure from the typical DIPA, and those disturbed by the monotony of that genre may find this of interest. Personally I found that I really liked the first pack I had, but after a few encounters it became tiring. It's a lot to handle in a beer, and is probably best saved for special occasions.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Look: Hazy pale gold color. 2-finger head and great head retention. Some bubbles continue to cascade upward, but not that reactive.    Smell: Sweet, buttery, malty, and fruity. Like tart fruit and citrus. Very floral.    Taste: Only a tad bit of hop bitterness at first. You then get a BLAST of malt and caramel sweetness. This has that nice sweet and savory flavor that I can only describe as "buttery". The sweetness hangs on for quite some time before drying out only slightly. As the sweet caramel fades, you have an aftertaste of biscuits, crackers, slightly smoked wood, and flowers.    Feel: Medium bodied beer. Feels fuller than I expected. Stays fairly fizzy the entire journey through.    Overall: Awesome beer. I was not expecting this to be so flavorful. It is right at that fine line between a Pale Ale and an IPA. Tastes like caramel and I occasionally got some chocolate hints, which is uncommon for a pale brew. Bought this as a single, but will be looking a 6-pack next.

Couldn't wait to open it and then....thud. What? I mean this is drinkable....has a nice barley taste, albeit a bit dry, but why on earth is this so highly rated? IPA it is not, the nose is foul and just an overall lack of something(s) make this a beer you know....meh to drink....but definitely not seek out. Someone said the nose was: pine, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple. Here is me telling you that it is NONE of those things.

It has a hoppy/malt mix that seems to work against one another, giving it a sort of astringent taste. Again, maybe I caught a bad bottle, but I don't think so. I would not buy this beer again.

It looks like a beer should look.    Smell: pine, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple!    Taste: the taste! It taste like a perfect beer! Tangerine, orange, loafy bread, tangerine, grapefruit, pine, pineapple, floral, awesome happiness, slight alcohol taste.    Mouth feel: a full beer mouthful. Thick goodness.    Overall: this is one of my favorite beers. It looks, taste and feels like a beer. If one beer in the world was made, this just might be it. I hate being pretentious, but my palette is extremely picky. If you don't like this beer, you're just wrong and need to come back once you trained your palette.

Taste: Floral front, strong taste of roses. Slight bitter hops finish. Personally not a huge fan of heavily floral beers.     Feel: Dry, bitterness.    Overall: Too floral for my liking.

I get a strong piney scent minor bread like smell. No noticeable fruit or alcohol aromas. Starts with a mild malty sweetness but the citrus and piney hop flavors come through as you drink. Though there didn't appear to be much carbonation you can feel it. There is also a slight stickiness to it as it sticks in the back of your throat and has a drying affect.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Another Lagunitas offering and another very good brew. I still can find no real fault with this brewer.    I do have to mention though, there really ain't much special about the coloration, it was your basic amber-colored beer. The head was very white, very fluffy, but the lacing was thick and covered the glass almost all the way down the pint glass - it was actually quite impressive. The scent was a perfect, and I do mean perfect, mixture of citrus and coriander mixed with the strong hoppy smell. The mouthfeel was mostly carbonated, but not so much so to detract from the overall experience. Speaking of overall, this was truly a wonderfully crafted beer. It had the same taste as what I smelled which is a big plus in my book - making the whole beer very flavorful.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Beautiful lighter shade of gold with good cap and lacing.    Aroma is like stepping into a dark conifer forest. The hop aroma comes full on in an unobtrusive way, there's a lot of it but it's not pushy. Hints of spice dance about like a sprinkling of sunbeams lightly filtered through the boughs above.    Yes, the flavor is resinous, just like the brewery says, but it's a pleasant bunch of buds. Grains come through in the buttery rich body but it's hops that lead the band. Finish is clean with a pleasantly bitter aftertaste.    Overall this is a complex beer with positive points. It is a broad shoulder, big body, big flavor, big hop brew put together in a cohesive whole that fulfills and doesn't disappoint.

Smells of cat pee, cat nip, herbal notes and a hint of lemon and fruitiness, really dank and fried onion like.    Tastes of cat pee, cat nip, herbal notes, a fair amount of what I like to think is brown sugar, and some butter.    Medium somewhat syrupy body, dry finish. Medium level of spicy carbonation.    Got in Petaluma California at the 7-11 just down from Lagunita's Brewing. Drinking in Motel 6, Petaluma. Its been on my wish list and I would have had it at Lagunita's brewhouse, but it was closed when I arrived at 10:30pm. Very hoppy in a catty kind of way, and well done but different.

The feel is really nice, thin but slightly sticky feeling, not a whole lot of carbonation. Taste is amazing, very unique. I almost can't describe it other than it tastes just as it smells, like an IPA, but not... A little bit of bitterness and bite, but sweet and citrusy, just beautiful. Super tasty beer, I buy it quite often and always enjoy it. Lagunitas really has some fine beers.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Reading the ratings, it appears you really like it or you really dislike it. I liked it. Lagunitas beers all seem to have a similar citrusy theme. I have not come across a bad Lagunitas brew. I feel this beer is very well balanced for an 8.0 percenter and really enjoyed it. However, I can only have one or two of these and I have to call it a day.

look: 3.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 I was not impressed. There was no balance whatsoever.   To be fair, I am a fan of Stouts and Porters and like the ones with a good finish. This beer reminds me of smelling a bottle Pine-Sol disinfectant, with an aftertaste of what I imagine Pine-Sol tastes like.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.25 Appearance is golden with slight haze and thick creamy white foam cap. Intense hop aroma, with strong citrus and hints of pine. Great bready malt flavor up front with a strong but well balanced hop bitterness that doesn’t overpower. Medium creamy mouthfeel, especially for an IPA. Finishes with a clean hop bite and touch of warmth from the alcohol.

Smells of citrus, grapefruit and lemon, very inviting.   Tastes like it smells citrus fruit up front and leaves a mellow bitterness on the tounge. Has a sticky feel, it coates the mouth with great flavor that leaves you craving the next sip.   One of my favorite IPAs, complex flavors that stay with you long after you finish it and make you want to suck down another one.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 This is the way a lot of imperial (double) IPAs tend to taste. They are sweet in a sickly citrus way. I think it's the booze along with the slick malty backbone as well that makes them feel heavier and doesn't feel as clean or snappy. They tend to be overly carbonated, hoppy tastes (bitter, earth) are being leveraged against a stronger sugar content and seems often out of balance. Sometimes they are astringent rather than pleasantly "strong."    Lagunitas consistently makes solid samplings of many styles-- their Hop Stoopid is a reliable DIPA that is more aggressively hop-forward and pine-y than this one. Their Imperial Stout is also one of my favorite go-tos, not least because of the price. $4.99 for a bomber can't be beat (although 2 more bucks usually gets you a better beer). This, a "substitute" to BrownShugga (which I never had), is another generic example, more candied citrus than Hop Stoopid, almost sickly in my opinion and there's little of the nuance a world-class DIPA demonstrates. The BrownShugga in the name must indicate the original intention, a brown-sugar, caramel-y malt base in which bread and some rye/hop character sneak in early and then late.     The 8% listed on the label (the 7.85% here may be a different brewing ago?) can be felt in the taste and may have thrown things off. It didn't really click with me. Not bad but maybe seems to be trying too hard?    EDIT 12/1/16: got myself a Brown Shugga. Damn, that's a good beer. First, it's got a maltier and nevertheless as sweet hoppy flavor as this. Also at 9.8% it's stronger and the alcohol is more prominent. BrownShugga is closer to a barleywine (which that itself is a "substitute" for), dark and muddy although still in DIPA territory. This, "sucks", is a pale imitation now I see. A little more sweet, a little less body, a little less alcohol. I was a bit harsh but now I know the truth.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Pours a light amber color. Thick off white 1 finger head with a ton of lacing. Dark fruit, caramel, and raisin on the nose. Flavor is well balanced but on the malty side. A little sweetness at the end from the unfermented complex sugars. Not typical profile for a DIPA as hops are not the star here but very tasty nonetheless. Medium low carbonation with a light medium body. Overall, this is a great IPA that leans to the malty side of the spectrum. I am not sure when this beer was bottled but I assume it had a more present hop character when it was fresh. Love the malt and great story behind the making.   
look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 I love Double IPA's. This one looks perfect, smells great but it's lacking just a little on citrus notes. It's not a terribly bitter beer and the feel is light. I can't say it's my favorite Dbl IPA but it's close.

Tastes very bitter and has that classic Lagunitas smell that is characteristic of many of their beers, along with a piney hop aroma. Honestly I would not say that this beer "Sucks" but for being brewed by Lagunitas, it isn't that impressive to me. They have way better offerings in my opinion and this is one of the worst ones for me.     (Shrug)    This beer is not a pimple on Brown Shugga's ass, and certainly not a worthy substitute. Just my opinion.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 A foamy creamy head that is one finger thick with good retention. The color of the beer is a nice orange color with some amber tints. The clarity of the beer is clear with some good carbonation bubble.     Rich floral, pine, and grapefruit with some tropical notes come first I smell this beer. A light grass, and toasted bread with yeast finish it.     Definite grapefruit, tropical, herbal, resin, and some floral notes on the palate. The beer is lightly toasted with a touch of caramel, grass, and yeast    The mouthfeel is bitter, tannic, carbonated, and finish crisp.     The beer is good I think the hop is a tad underwhelming to me. The malt has a very nice back and could hold a touch more hop character. Good DIPA

Super hoppy like you'd expect a west coast IPA to be. The hops have a little bit more bitterness and a little less grapefruit/citrus than my favorites.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Double IPA with a color somewhere between golden and coppery with a healthy white foamy lacing. Before you even sip this beer there is a very strong, pleasant citrusy / hoppy smell that hits you. The taste confirms the smell. It has a strong grapefruit flavor with more subtle pine and orange flavors and a hop profile that seems stronger than the 65 ibu it is listed as. It has some definite bitterness, but it isn’t overwhelming like some DIPAs. I would say it is about equal to that of a standard grapefruit. The bitterness doesn’t linger and you are left with a very crisp, refreshing feeling at the end of the drink. This would be a great DIPA or a great beer in general on a summer day. It’s not the best DIPA I’ve ever had, but it’s definitely up there and even though IPAs aren’t typically my favorite. Lagunitas is a brewery that I really like overall and it’s cheaper than many others that I think are inferior to it and this beer confirms that.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Looks clear golden orange with lightly streaming carbonation, a thick, sticky off white head, and leaves sheets of lacing.    On the aroma, you get pine upfront, and then zesty, spritzy citrus oils; orange peel, a bit of grapefruit, and then some underlying peach and pineapple.    On the palate, upfront you're smacked with lots of grapefruit and pithy orange. This transitions into sweeter tropical fruits; peach, pineapple, and a touch of mango. There is an underbelly of malt sweetness, biscuit bordering on caramel, but smooth and not obtrusively sweet or sugary. The finish transitions to a sharp bite of pine sap and the characteristic Lagunitas chalk/rubber note, but it's a faint suggestion here and not obnoxious and detracting like some of their other beers. Finishes surprisingly clean, neither super dry nor overly sweet, with only a touch of bitterness and lightly lingering pine needles and orange pith.    The mouthfeel is medium, medium-lightly carbonated, very smooth and bordering on creamy. Lightly dry on the finish.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.5 Gonna be a short one from a 12 oz bottle...    This is Lagunitas' Lil' Sumpin Ale with a sweet kick to it. Not really my thing, but they nailed the goal of what they were looking to accomplish. I'm going East Coast vs West Coast on this with Founder's vs Lagunitas. This is what AB vs Miller should have been.

Well let's see if it lives up to its name. Pours medium thickness, orange/golden, a bit hazy, 5+ fingers of foamy white head that stuck around, spotty lacing. Nose is sweet malt, taste is malt and some funky bitter tastes I can't identify. OK mouthfeel, and overall I can't say it sucks, though I'm not a fan. I do like it better than the Brown Shugga' it is a substitute for!   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Very drinkable beer. Really well rounded with the hops and citrus flavors working well together. I think this is a good bargain @ $9 a sixer. Will buy again.

This is a beast of a brew and although I would choose Brown Shugga over this Substitute this is still a massive brew. Extreme fruity tones throughout making it hard for me to even distinguish what is what. With lacing left for days, it tastes great and is almost just as fun to drink and put down constantly to see all the rings left on the glass. It's a bitter beer so you have to get used to that, but it's well done.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Pours a clear, vibrant light copper in color with abut under a finger of white head, average retention. Aroma is very subdued and lacks the hop presence if expect from a DIPA. It's skewer towards caramelly malt with a touch of citrus. Taste is an improvement with spiny more citrus and some pine but a substantial malty-ish presence. There is a touch of caramel and a light sweetness that segues to a decent bitterness that balances the beer and lingers a bit in the finish. Decent mouthfeel, medium body and medium-low carbonation. Overall a good beer but not one that I expect to seek out again. I'll give this another shot if I find it again given my affinity for Lagunitas, I'm a big fan of pretty much every other beer I've had from them but I'm disappointed.

Finish comes off as a touch more short and watery. But seriously...fresh at $10 a sixer, this is hard to beat!    I love Maximus and Hop Stupid, but I can see the genius here! Glad Petaluma is right up the road!    Grade 93+/94-, A all day!   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured an aggressive finger of head into pint glass. Dark, almost burnt orange color produced a very citrus, floral aroma. Taste was filled with great citrus flavors such as grapefruit, orange, and even mango. Nice hop presence as well. Lacing proved how dank this beer really is. Beautiful layered lacing all the way down. Fantastic brew. One of my all time favs.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Mostly clear golden/copper in color with a monstrous head. Foamy/creamy with great retention.    Very big malt aroma. I know this isnt brown shuggah, but I am getting brown sugar on the nose. Grains and malt mostly. A bit of alcohol and tobacco as it warms.    Taste: again, very malt forward for an IPA. Almost no bitterness, certainly on the light side. Very odd "IPA" if you ask me.    Im sorry to disagree with the majority on this one, but this is hardly an IPA to me so I have to adjust my rating a bit.    Its not bad, I just wouldnt call this an IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 From an undated quart bottle. Golden color with a finger of white head. Great smell of piney hops. Smooth feel and big hop flavor. Definitely on the bitter side (IBU of 63, the bottle says). Good example of the style. The only possible downside is that there's nothing unique about this, and I think I'd struggle to tell it apart from other California DIPAs if I did a blind test.   
look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 Had this last night and was pretty pumped about it but it turned out to be another disappointment for me from lagunitas. Poured a light golden color with a nice retaining white head. The taste is where I had an issue. Just not much going on for me. At 8% I could taste the booze coming through (surprising for an 8%), I got hardly any of the piny, dank hoppy punch I was expecting. I have seen plenty of good reviews on this beer and I am sure many people like it, maybe I grabbed a bad one?? IDK....

(My avatar WILL be a green quart tavern tall returnable Ballantine ale from the 70s.) The forum worries about container size. I don't mind beer in larger sizes and growlers because I prefer them a little flat.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Out of a bottle into my tulip.  A – Slightly hazy, light golden pour with a vivid white head that settles quickly.   S- Hops, piney, floral, light brown sugar   T – Mildly sweet to start with a good bite of piney, resinous flavor. Hoppy bitterness. Tails off with some solid citrus flavors of orange and grapefruit.   M – Medium carbonation. Little slick and smooth.   O – Tasty brew right here. Lot of flavors which are well balanced and play off each other.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Served in a shaker, it pours a clear golden yellow with a two-finger head, foamy, with good retention and very good lacing.    The bouquet is a fruit cocktail, tropical and dank. Mango, papaya, pineapple, passion fruit… lots of passion fruit. Very assertive.     The fruit cocktail continues in the mouth. Very smooth and light body, with just the necessary carbonation. You can tell it's very bitter, but it balances greatly with the malty sweetness and all the fruits you get; however, the bitterness prevails in its long finish.     Outstanding beer.   
look: 2.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 4.25 Hazy gold with covering lace.   Full body, intense flavor, fairly hot and rich mouthfeel, nice carbonation, long palate.   Very bitter but balanced.   Intense hop flavors, resiny, grapefruity.   Satisfying and enjoyable.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Shaker pint glass, there is no "best by" date that I can find.    APPEARANCE: pours a golden honey color with lots of larger sediments floating about, less than one-finger off-white head that quickly dissipated until a thin, broken layer of small bubbles remained, there is significant lacing on the glass, lightly carbonated.    SMELL: peppery, brown sugar, bread, grapefruit citrus and pine resin, I can also smell some booze.    TASTE: the taste follows the nose precisely, peppery then sweet brown sugar, some grapefruit citrus and pine resin, the 8% ABV is perceptible.    PALATE: medium body and lightly carbonated.    OVERALL: this is a solid traditional DIPA, I would buy this again and would recommend to anyone who enjoys the style.

Crystal clear in the glass with a 2"+ creamy off white head that lasts and leaves nice thick lacing down the glass.  AROMA: Lots of pine and citrus/grapefruit, a nice sweetness to the aroma, doesn't smell harsh at all. Very resinous.  TASTE: Sweet malt, then the citrus and pine bitterness kick in nicely and head for the finish line. Very well balanced if you like a nice bitter/sweet ratio.  FEEL: Incredibly smooth while still some nice effect from ample carbonation. You get a little of the sticky hop resin but the beer finishes on the dry side.  OVERALL: Awesome DIPA right here, great balance and no harshness, whatsoever.

Blast of hops, piney, green, vegetal, proprietary. Wow.     Taste super light dry cracker pale malt body allows for maximum hop penetration, oats for smoothness and knocking down the bitterness. Not gratingly bitter either, lots of citrus fruit and pine dankness like you opened a bottle from the dispensary.     New hop varieties seem to have a short shelf life though, this one gets compromised pretty quick, drink asap is more important with this one than about any other.

Could be flat from growler. Gotta take with this one. Smells of boozy notes, sweet burnt sugary taste lingers on palate. Very noticeable. Malt and sugar doesn't combat slight bitterness but rather compliments

Taste follows with the smell, almost all pine. Bitterness is pretty sharp upfront, with a sweet malty presence that plays second fiddle somewhere in the background. Very hop forward.     Overall, this is a beer you'll remember. I wouldn't call it smooth because the flavor and bitterness are somewhat jarring, but if you need something to wake up your pallet, this will do the trick!

Good retention and leaves lots of lace.    S: 4.25 Lots of fresh, tropical fruit coming from the hops. Plenty of orange and lemon peel, papaya, banana, and a hint of pine in the background.     T: 4.5 Flavors are just right and very balanced. It starts super juicy and fresh with only mild sweetness before a good dose of hop bitterness and pine kick in. The bitterness lingers on the finish with a touch of pepper, but it also has a citrus quality to balance it out.     M: 4.5 Good body with excellent carbonation and quite drinkable. There’s also some dryness on the finish that is really nice.    O: 4.5 Great west coast IPA. Terrific flavors and aromas while being refreshing and satisfying.

The smell is a healthy blend of brown sugar and hops. Upon taking a drink, sweet, brown sugar notes open up, before giving way to a subtle hoppy finish. Nothing too drastic on either end. It plays quite nice between the subtle sweetness and bitterness. It feels great as well. The beer doesn't feel too harsh on the carbonation side. It's nice and smooth. Very easy to drink. Overall, this is a good beer. Glad I finally found it on the shelf and gave it a try.    Served in a 12oz snifter.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Good looking beer with a nice floral nose. The taste starts well, a citrusy floral experience, but ends with a cherry plasticky taste. I am having this draft and I believe I am tasting whatever beer was on the rap before this. Not Lagunitas' problem, I can sense the underlying intended beer taste and I will try it again to sort it out.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Look: Orange-amber body, slight haze but not completely opaque. Huge, fluffy white foam head which sticks around for a seriously long time and maintains it thickness. Nice lacing as well.    Aroma: Somewhat grassy scent, accompanied by pine and fresh citrus. Sweet malts also dominated the profile, while the hops remain relatively low-key. Interesting tropical/pine medley here.    Taste: Sweet malts and a complex citrus accompaniment (pear, orange, grapefruit, lemon). Towards the end is when you really get the full array of rye, wheat, etc.    Feel: Unbelievably smooth for a DIPA coming in at nearly 8%. Excellent balance of malts and hops, not too bitter. I could drink this one all day, every day.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 A: Light golden blonde and clear, poured into a pint glass, it produced a medium size head and had medium to high carbonation.  S: A wonderful citrus aroma with pear, apricot, and other citrus notes  T: A wonderfully pleasing IPA that provides a steady stream of citrus flavor as it rolls across the taste buds and streams down your throat. Orange, grapefruit, lemon flavors deliver a completely satisfying taste experience. The beer has some malt depth as well and it displays some bread flavors.   M: Moderate carbonation and chewy, bready malt provide a definite presence.   O: No doubt that it's a great IPA and it has a lot depth and dimension, but I have to admit, it seems to be closer to a single IPA than a double.

The aromas are of pine cones with mandarines and the taste is delicious and well balanced. it taste earthy and you taste the pines with the rye and it finishes with a nice bittersweet finish. this is now one of my favorites next to Alpine Nelson.

The lacing is nice and lasts through the entire beer.    The smell is a slightly sweet hop scent.    The taste experience is unique- it starts smooth, goes to hops (not hoppy), peaks with bitterness and hops, then tapers into a finish of something like brown sugar.    The feel is relatively smooth, with a hint of bitterness after the swallow that tapers quickly.    Overall, it is a wonderful example of a dry hopped ale. It is exceptionally smooth, hop-balanced, and drinkable, with a punch that sneaks in with the subtle sweetness. The label is interesting, the story behind the beer intriguing, and the brewery not without humility.

The appearance was a hazy bronzed golden to brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Lightly rimmed lace clings to the glass in a spiderweb sort of way.  The smell has a slight almost "brown sugar" aroma sliding over some caramel malts and backed up by a nice eloquent bitter to grassy and slight lemon sort of hops to blend nicely.  The taste had a forefront of the malt forward sweetness sliding into a delicate bitterness, weaves nicely in and around that "brown sugar"-esque flavor. There's a lingering sweet aftertaste like a normal Lagunitas beer and adds a sly sweet to bitter finish.  In the mouthfeel, there's a sweet sessionable sticky feel rolling over an ever so slight clingy bitterness. I'd say it sits about medium bodied with a fine smoothness to it.  Overall, what's not to love, DIPA done Lagunitas style, of course, I'd have again.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Definitely a first class beer! Pours a amber/straw color with a quickly dissipating head that lingers to a thin lace. Smell is a great sweet hoppy scent. Taste is fantastic, sweet and bitter. Some fruitiness. Feel is thin with a great amount of carbonation (not too much, too little, just right).

Brewers who are foisting upon us some of the overwrought, fishy IPAs should be forced to study Lagunitas. They never set a foot wrong.    The look is very promising - a deep amber with orange. There's some haze to it. It's not perfectly clear like a Boston Lager or another quality craft lager. It's an ale. The head laces up . . . whoa . . . over the glass watch it! Get out your sundial while you wait for it to subside. The foam on Sucks is borderline eternal. Lacing is very showy. Lagunitas has done something special with the malt here.    The aroma of Sucks is what everyone who thinks they are brewing up a West Coast IPA or Double IPA thinks they are doing. It is tropical-citrus-pine, which does not exist, except through carefully crafted hops. They know how to do it. It's a powerful and pleasant aroma that stays solid all the way to the bottom of the glass. It's never catty.    The taste is something special. We get the initial powerful hop bite, but it's backed up splendidly with the malt. The malt is not just thick and rich, and it is, but it is multifaceted. The complexity of Sucks unfolds as you drink it - the tropical-citrus-pine splash, a hint of sweet and a hint of spice.     The feel of Sucks is pretty remarkable. At times, it can seem almost syrup-like. This ale is multi-faceted and it unfolds as you drink it. There is a lot of alchemy happening here.    Overall, this is a wildly enjoyable ale. It's not cheap, but it's excellent.

Tastes like bitter grapefruit when it's cold, and starts to meld and become more like brown sugar/molasses as it warms. This is a perfect mix of IPA and Red/Amber flavors. Slightly bitter and hoppy but sweet and malty too. The feel is light with moderate carbonation. A pretty easy to drink, bitter caramelized grapefruit beer, getting sweeter as it warms. One of my favorite Lagunitas offerings.

The froth is a little more than light(just slightly) on a light medium thick scale. The smell of the beer is very nice and refreshing. The color is a sort of rich but light translucent amber gold. The body is halfway between light and medium on a light medium thick scale.    Lagunitas Sucks is a great American Double/Imperial. Its hoppyness is initially semi reminiscient of "Dirtwolf Double IPA" in that it has that sort of gamy hop flavor to it that tastes natural if you will. The end notes of the flavor of L.S. however are somewhat more "rounded" if you will than some other Double IPA/Imperials, and hence it has a really smoothe and semi-sweet ending to the sort of initial satisfying natural hoppyness of the flavor. The flavor is also sort of refreshing. The peaked wild-hoppy initial taste is sort of balanced out with the sort of sweet hop peaked ending. Its really a nice transition and makes for a great taste.    Overall I would definitely suggest this beer to anyone who is a fan of the wild-hop flavor, and even if one isn't I would suggest it based on the interesting and good sort of final notes of this beer's taste which are quite good.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 My first review. This was as good of a beer as any to pop my reviewing cherry  Look: Poured into a snifter. Hazy and deep copper, golden and Amber body with a half a finger head that dissipates quickly. Some lacing.   Smell: Light hoppy aroma with a punch of citrus and grapefruit rinds. Not too much of a nose to it considering the ABV, but still a pleasant and well balanced aroma.   Taste: The nose doesn't lie as the citrus and grapefruit aromas are forward on the palate from the beginning. Some pine, bitter oak, resiny as it sits. This is just such a well balanced taste, giving you a nice dose of hops without being too floral and a generous amount of malt on the aftertaste. A little bit bitter, but that's nitpicking considering how smooth this goes down.   Feel: Medium body with some carbonation and creaminess to it. Easy to down a number of these and not lose its flavor.   Overall: An incredibly well balanced and drinkable IPA that satisfies hop-heads without turning off the "IPAs are too bitter crowd". Really special beer that has a high level of re-drinkability.

Smell- Heavy pine, with a citric grapefruit aroma as well.     Taste- Sweet malt, toasted cracker, bulding to a resinous piney flavor. Quite citric as the bitterness builds to the finish. Finish is sweet and highly bitter, sweet coming from a little bit of brown sugar spiciness.    Mouthfeel- Heavy in body with a creamy well carbonated feel.    Overall- A finely crafted double that works off a good malt/hop profile. Well balanced. Brown sugar was evident in the finish which added some complexity.

Nose is a bit to the pine and onion side with a good amount of the malt coming through.    Flavor is a bit of a letdown. Malt coming through lot more than expected. Hop profile is muted and muddled. Not bad but just tough to pull something distinct like "pine" - really just a decent bit of bitter.    It's been a long time since I've had any Lagunitas but this doesn't have the bright hop profile I always associated with their IPAs.

Great beer that deserves the rating it's given. Hopefully the quality won't go away with the Heineken ownership now.

Pours dark cola brown with barely any translucence, and a thick creamy brownish tan head spilling over the top...I wouldn't call it thick or creamy to the palate, but definitely hearty, chewy, and medium-bodied. Full flavored... with both citrus hopping and carmel maltiness, slight overtones towards molasses but not overly sweet... Quite a tasty to sip all night

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Bought a 32oz bottle (1 quart) and poured it into a pint shaped 12oz glass (obviously, extra in bottle). Didn't see an expiration date but the bottle number is (printed this way):    191 5 2  0580 1508    Appearance: golden with a hazy color to it. It was lively and very carbonated. As I was finishing the beer from the glass, the foam (head) was easily seen and can be used as markers on how much I drank. It clings to the side of the glass    Smell: toasty, herbal, and citrusy. The odder was strong as when I opened the bottle, you can smell it right away    Taste: very hoppy and furmenty with an after taste. It was not dry so you can still taste the beer in your throat. It's sweet and fruity which causes an after taste    Mouth feel: crisp, carbonated, and heavy. You can taste what you smell and it lingers in your mouth    Overall: a great beer that has real flavor. The high alcohol content can be felt in how heavy the beer taste. There is a lot of foam present on the side of the glass so the beer kept its balance. Could only drink 2-3 at most because it is both heavy with ABV and taste. Went to the brewery site and it's "not" a seasonal beer but is brewed when available. Well worth trying and having around to share.

It's a good-looking ale with nothing at all to indicate it's remotely inferior...    And the aroma suggests it's actually superior, as this brewery's recipes tend to be. Every bit as generously hopped as you might expect, this smells overwhelmingly of chive blossoms, combining herbal, grassy, and floral components making it at once crudely earthy and pleasantly perfumy.     My best efforts to replicate this at home (not using a brew-kit) would be to hollow out some pineapples, grapefruits and lychees and bake those skins with a dash of pantry spice and then drizzle with melted wildflower honey. I'd also add some green tea to replicate the dry, lightly astringent finish.     Hungover I believe, but what I don't buy is that the folks at Lagunitas were "broke... and ready to take a job at Arby's" when they came up with this recipe. After all, by their own admission, this was only created out of necessity because their year-round offerings were in such high demand. Boo hoo.     That self-loathing is branding, plain and simple. The name "Sucks" is nothing more than salesmanship - and salesmanship is what fetched such a pretty penny from Heineken. To their credit, however, the liquid in the glass is ultimately why Lagunitas has very rightfully enjoyed the success they have...     But make no mistake: they're now a money-making branding machine that can no longer work off of the virtue of being subversive or counter-cultural. Let's be clear: they are now the culture. Given the quality and character of offerings like 'Sucks' that's a very good thing in my books.

Well balanced between the hop, malts and carb sucrose, but for the most part no flavor and forgetable.    This 16 ounce bottle tastes much different than the 32 ounce quart that I drank 8 months ago.    I'm guessing that the recipe changed.     Sucks used to have this sugary, hoppy bite to it. The present version has none of that.    While It is well balanced and drinkable, it's just not the same Sucks as we are used to. Weather or not this has to do with the hops receding in the sunlight due to distributor negligence and old age I will never know, because I did not see and bottle dating on the packaging, and as such Lagunitas takes the hit on this particular review.     BTW, this six pack was purchased in PA on 9-18-2015 at a Weis Supermarket. The distributor is Erie, and apparently they are a bunch of slouches who do not care about the products they sell. I have seen Erie Distribution ship Stone Ruination 1.0 from 9-2014 to store locations as late as 6-2015. This is why bottle dating (not drink by dating) is crucial in the present market landscape. Distributors are going to destroy smaller craft brewers reputations with customers because they don't have the marketing resources to properly manage ale shelf life logistics.     This sixer of Sucks was very forgettable and Lagunitas seems to have changed to recipe to compete with Stone Ruination 2.0, but it doesn't quite measure up. Or perhaps I just got an old batch from this backwoods distributor. But again, I have no way of knowing this because I did not see any bottle dating on the packing or bottles.     I got no fruity hopiness on the palette whatsoever, and this isnt a case of lulupin because I drank this side by side with one of my dry hopped extract sculpin clone homebrews, and i got tons of fruity and resinous hop tastes and scents from that, but nothing from Sucks.    Pass.

Flavor is hop dominant with tons of late addition and dry hop flavors (tropical juices, pine, spice, grapefruit) blended with malt goodness and alcohol bite. Not as much of a resinous bitterness as others have but still balances . Mouthfeel is medium-full and slightly sugary and tingly from the ethanol. Overall, I would say this is one of the best crafted double IPAs out there and I'm glad that Lagunitas has made it to the Sooner State. I thoroughly enjoyed it-- and this is coming from a critic of overly hoppy beers. Sometimes it just plain works. Lagunitas has its shite together.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 From backlog. 32oz bottle, May 2015.    Solid, reliable IPA, especially when fresh. Very balanced. Piney/citrus hops with a solid malt backbone of malty sweetness.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Pours a honey hue with a nearly white head. Smells of hops and pine. Taste initially hits with a strong citrus flavor, which gives way to pine and hops. Mouthfeel is neither too thick nor too thin. Overall an outstanding beer, that leans more towards balance and complexity than big hop or big malt. As an aside, it's one of the best value beers (at $10 a 6-pack) I've had.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Disclaimer: this bottle is a bit older than ideal.    A - Hazy golden pour with a nice thick off white head at one finger. Good carbonation. Good lace with some rings and retention of what was originally there. Lovely.    S - Dank, piney, floral, pineapple, grapefruit.    T - Sweet fruit, candy, dankness, pine, malt backbone is there with a bit of alcohol.    M - Fairly bitter finish, some harsh sugar notes, good full bod and and good carbonation.     O/D - This bottle is a bit old so this review must be taken with a grain of salt. This is a decent DIPA. Lot's of dank, west coast notes, but lacking that punch. Balance is there, making it pretty enjoyable, but the sweetness is a bit much. Body and flavour are still enjoyable though. A good one that would likely be great fresh.

Flavor is similar with the pine coming through the most. It does have a good sweet malt backbone too which goes great together with the mild bitterness. I think this is a very underrated IPA!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Lots of bitterness and fruity hop flavor. Everything really comes together well, malt is present but just enough to back up the hops. Great execution of an all around good IPA.    Update: generally fruity and slightly sweet, a little cloyingness? Still pleasant although after having many undercover shutdown ales this tastes extremely similar.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter tasting glass.    A= Golden, yellow, thin white head that settles quickly.    S= Hops up front with pine/earthy and spiciness.    T= Pine and citrus hops with an underlying malt sweetness, medium level of bitterness, balanced and clean tasting.    M= Medium body with active carbonation.     O= Clean flavors and balance of malt and hop flavor, bitterness, and sweetness.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pour golden in color with 1/2 finger of head.    Aroma is very pine-citrus forward. Good amount of dankness.     The beer is very hop forward with only a kiss of malts added to keep it from becoming totally un-balanced. It surprisingly isn't all that bitter (at least to my taste buds). Follows the nose perfectly! This is all about the pine. You get that light and crisp lemon citrus along with it. Not nearly as dank as the aroma would predict though. I love the active carbonation that compels another sip. As the beer warms, the malt begins to sweeten up the finish and a bit more citrus finishes the sip.    Overall, while I am more of a tropical fruit IPA guy, this is an excellent example of the pine-forward IPA's. I would actually buy this again based on the high availability, cheap price, and high drink-ability. I see this pairing well with cheese fries with bacon and a thousand-island drizzle. It gets a 87/100.
