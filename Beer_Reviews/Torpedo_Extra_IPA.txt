look: 3.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 A big IPA for the price of one much smaller in depth. We were surprised at how well this beer holds up against other widely available classics. Juicy, refreshing, and full of hop flavor, this beer is good choice if you're looking for something familiar.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours deep amber with a small white head that reduces to a film and leaves some lacing on the edges of the glass.    The aroma is full of hop character - citrus fruit, pine, and floral notes come to the front. There is not much in the way of malt in the aroma.    The flavor follows suit with big hop character - a firm bitterness followed by notes of grapefruit and pine. The malt is balancing without subtracting from the hops.     Medium bodied and drinkable.    Great example of the style. Always a good choice when fresh.

A nice well-balanced and easy drinking IPA that doesn’t overwhelm you with hoppy bitterness. Some pine, grapefruit, and other fruity notes. Malt balances the hops and has a clean dry finish. Great go-to IPA.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Look: A dark amber color, almost representative of an amber or cider ale.  Smell: Strong with hops, with a bitter presence.  Taste: The hops and bitterness are strong. Minimal sweetness. Surprisingly underwhelming however, in terms of flavor.  Feel: Average. Carbonation is moderate.  Overall: A solid representation of a highly hopped brew. However the extra hops and bitterness are not balanced with flavor, however that is characteristic of the style, I suppose. Not a brew I would have often, but an interesting brew nonetheless.

Pours a nice lighter amber color with a little head and spotty lingering lacing. Smells a little more faintly of some nice citrus zest hops and some weaker floral hops. Tastes similarly, along with some malt, caramel, piney hops and bread. Smooth thin mouthfeel, good carbonation. Again, nice and easy to drink, just not particularly memorable. Certainly, I was expecting something “extra” and this beer just never delivered.

Aroma is citrus, pine & herbal/leafy hops, fruity with a sweet caramel malt note. Taste is caramel malt sweet balanced with pine heavy, light citrus & herbal hops. There is a leafy dank hint & pepper in the latter half of the sip. There's something a little tropical here also. It finishes bittersweet and fades to dry & increasing bitterness. Mouthfeel is moderate-heavy bodied with low-moderate carbonation, wet fronted, slick with a little bit of pepper bite & a hint of aftertaste astringency.

A: Pours a clear, dark amber color with orange highlights and a foamy, light wheat colored head, solid retention, and excellent lacing.  S: Aromas of grapefruit and pine, but earthier and woodsier that many IPAs.  T: The palate certainly follow the nose, but the caramel/molasses/bready malt core is now front and center.  M: Medium bodied with excellent carbonation and full, creamy presence.  O: A top shelf American IPA. My buddy tells me he buys it by the case. Maybe I should.

Sheets of lacing.    S: Very woodsy smelling, tree bark and pine cones with some earth. There's also a nice citrus quality of bitter grapefruit zest and juicy pink grapefruit flesh.    T: Grapefruit zest and pink grapefruit flesh upfront, but leans more bitter and oily than juicy or sweet. Nice candy caramel and toffee notes without getting cloying, as well as some nice bread crust. The finish grows piney with a bitterness that contains to build and grow to consider levels after about ten seconds. Finishes fairly crisp and lightly dry, though.    F: Medium-plus with creamy carbonation, slick and oily with hop resins.    O: One of the OG IPAs of Americans, and still tastes amazing to this day. Highly recommended as a staple beer for all hopheads.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA - 7.2% ABV - 65 IBUs.  Date: 08/01/18, enjoyed on 09/20/18.  Appearance: Deep copper to burnt orange in color with two plus fingers of off white head.   Aroma: Dank and resinous with some grapefruit and a little pine. Its not really that complex, but it smells really good.  Taste: Taste pretty much follows the nose, but the IBUs are a tad deceptive as this is a fairly bitter beer, Chinook maybe? The hops also give the beer a slightly sticky quality, but there is a good sized malt backbone that is just a touch sweet. As Torpedo warms, it becomes more grapefruit forward.  Biased comments: Economical old school west coast IPA, whats not to like? Very solid and enjoyable, with the only downside being that it can be tough to find it fresh.

Lots of lacing on the glass.    Strong pine scent. Hints of citrus and tropical. Some grassy tones as well. Very nice smelling and what you’d expect of a West Coast IPA.    It’s got that good strong piney hop taste, but it’s offset well with the citrus and the malt.     Medium-Full bodied. Smooth finish offsetting the hoppy front.     Very well balanced, perfect bitterness offset with the clean and crisp citrus taste. Alcohol is very well hidden for a 7.2%. This is a very good beer and great value at $7.99 for a 6 pack that I’d definitely buy again. Sierra Nevada does not disappoint.

Tastes like an outstanding, traditional WC IPA, no fancy-schmancy stuff - just delicious hops over a simple but well proportioned malt base. Citrus and pine, some grass...sweet malts. WELL DONE.  Medium body, bright, perfect amount of carbonation. Long lingering hop bitterness.  Don't pass this up, great choice by Sierra Nevada to include this in the Fall Pack. Delicious, Sierra Nevada just gets better and better.

Close to a two finger, white colored head, which slowly recedes. Leaves behind sheets of lacing.   Expressive aroma of citrus and pine hops, with some caramel malts (more in the background).  Taste is redolent with hops (orange citrus, piney resin, and lighter floral). Certainly a caramel malt component. Bitterness is there but not overboard. Balanced by a slightly sweet aspect.  Medium to full mouth feel. Good carbonation.   A beer that begs each sip to linger in the mouth in order to experience the full spectrum of aroma and flavor. Years ago, before the explosion of craft beer choices, this beer was in my regular rotation. Coming back to this beer again emphasizes the craft expertise of this brewer. Once in a while it is a good choice to delve into beers once enjoyed, but usually passed over because of the multitude of choices in the new environment of local, newer local breweries.

T Wow, right into deep rich hops. There is a crispness [despite serious 7.2% ABV] from a citrus edge.  M. They've managed to structure a heavy ABV beer into a very nicely balanced brew. Put another way; it's very easy drinking for a beer this strong. It remains refreshing and relatively 'clean tasting'.  O This is very well constructed, great skill has clearly gone into it. For me, it's the kind of beer I'd start a night with, slowly sipping, before changing over to a more 'session' type beer later. Very nice, I'd happily buy and drink this again.

Dark copper color brightens to gold/amber when held up to light.  Smell features piney hops, grass and citrus.  The taste has piney hops and toasted malt up front with grassy herbal hops and semi-sweet malt in the middle and finally it ends with a spicy hop bitterness.  Medium body/carbonation, difficult to detect alcohol and a dry bitter finish that lingers.  Hops come at you from all angles yet they are balanced by the maltyness. This may have been the 1st IPA I tried years ago, happy to have revisited this one.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 This beer is pretty much perfect in my opinion. Color is super rich golden amber with a nice foam head. Smell is amazing - sweet malt, sweet grass, hops, fruit (strawberry, pineapple, peach). I would not drink this with a super heavy meal such as prime rib because it is a fairly heavy beer. I love drinking this as dessert, after my meal or with appetizers. I love the fact that the carbonation is very low, i don't like super carbonated beers. The taste is so great because it isn't too bitter, it's sweet bready malt, medium oily body with strong hop taste on the back end. The hop oil really makes this beer stand out. My body feels good when i drink this beer which is unusual. I just can't say enough good things about it, it is high calorie certainly not going to drink more than a few in one sitting but definitely worthy of a grade of A+ Well done Sierra Nevada i will buy this again and again.

Not a lot of fruity taste but straight up west coast pine and malt playing perfectly. What a great classic ipa that most people forget. I can drink a million of these and not get tired of the taste and feel of it. Awesome still after 20 years

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 5 Torpedo Extra IPA pours a copper color with a big, long-lasting creamy head and thick lacing. The scents of citrus, orange, pine, and a hint of apple float up to the nose. Upon taking a mouthful, the malt unfolds its sweetness up front before it makes room for the complex transition from pine and resin notes to fruity grapefruit bitterness from the hops, which stays well into the finish with relatively gentle warmth and a tannic zing. The interaction of flavors overall is phenomenal and gives a slightly different impression with each sip taken, while the medium-sublte carbonation makes sure to stay in the background. I fell in love with this massive beer.

Woody pine taste with a splash of spice and plenty of sweet, toasted malts. Just as the aroma, there's some fruit hidden in there (tangerine?). There's a good amount of bitterness but it almost felt disconnected from the taste of the hops. Medium body with slight oils.     Overall, it's a solid brew, but not as strong in flavor as advertised.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I was shocked I hadn’t reviewed this already. It’s been a go-to for several years now. Deep coppery color with full, foamy white.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Reached for a cold six pack while visiting family on Oahu; the grocery store pickings are slim out here in the Pacific so it’s a boon to be able to lean on SN’s trademark consistency and availability. Bottled about eight weeks ago so nothing to complain about from a freshness standpoint.    Nice golden copper hue with a puffy white head; looks like a classic IPA that, for me, Sierra Nevada basically sets the standard.    Aroma is marked by an earthy spiciness but also pine, resin, rind and a touch lemongrass all laid atop a slightly sweet and toasted malt. Green, citrusy and spicy. Great combo.    Taste is hops - green pine, citrus rind, grapefruit and papaya - and toasted and bready malt. Unbalanced balance, if you know what I mean. Nice bitterness that ties it all together.    Finishes with a kiss of resin but still crisp and dry. Lingering bitterness is pleasant. Perfect carbonation washes the flavors over the palate. No alcohol presence. An oasis in the vast tropical craft-netherworld.

A: Citrus fruit peel, caramel malt, and piney hops. Some lesser notes of danky and grassy hops round things out. Mild but nice old school mix.    T: Follows aroma, but to a much greater, fuller extent. Rich, deep flavor.     F: Medium, solid bitterness, great carbonation, a bit oily and coating at the end.    O: Solid, strong West Coast IPA. Old school, but with really great balance; not a maltfest. Great changeup to the everyday fruity IPA lineup.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Pours a medium amber, coppery coloration with a medium, fizzy head. Smells of bready malt, orange rind and a hint of pine. Taste follows the nose, with a nice balance of bready malt and citrus hops, with just a hint of pine. There's also a certain grassy, slightly flowery note to this. Finishes with a medium bitterness and a little more pine coming through. Medium body and carbonation. This reminds me a lot of Founders Centennial, but is not quite as good, in my opinion. More flowery and less resinous, although it also was two months older. With these 6-month old old school IPAs I'm never quite sure if they are supposed to taste this way or not.

Haven't had any SN since, till now.     Almost clear and golden orange in color with a 3 finger white head becoming thick and clingy as it recedes.    Grassy and piney hops predominate. I thought a caught a bit of funk initially, but decided it was a hint of caramel or toffey from the malts. Sweet and hoppy from the bottle.    Definitely not skunked. Initially, the taste is nearly dry and moderately bitter on the tongue, Then, on the swallow, the bitter piney hops try to duke it out with the rising sweet malts before the flavors fade with no clear winner. Taste of alcohol.    Moderately full in body. Crisp yet creamy. Moderate syrup coats the mouth. Drying, but not really astringent.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 It pours clear deep golden color with long lasting medium sized head. Foam leaves some laces. It smells strongly of grapefruit, pine and slightly biscuity malts. Taste is moderately hoppy bitter with citrusy and resiny notes, but caramelly grainy sweetness supports the balance. Not complex as I expected. Dry finish. Well hidden Abv. Med-full bodied and moderate carbonation. Not very exciting, but it's easy drinkable for strong IPA.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 In a world of IPA’s, Torpedo falls into the classic North West IPA. The aroma is sweet caramel malt with subtle floral earthy hops. Much follows in taste with a spicy, toffee like caramel malt. A light bitterness keeps it slightly in balance. The body and finish are fairly clean with a lingering sweet bitter caramel malt. Not my favorite but would drink if handed.

Not too strong for the hop flavor but a solid IPA. My buddy likes this beer and I had yet to try it. I'd never turn one down but there are other IPA's I'd rather have. This is an easy drinking beer and maybe an excellent palate cleanser. Overall I enjoyed the Torpedo but it wouldn't be on my favorites list for IPA's today. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle PKGD 12/30/2017.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 One of my go to IPAs. Probably has something to do with availability and price, but I'd still pick this over any other IPA in this price range (Sam Adam's is the only other one I can think of).     So, on to the beer. The appearance is an amber orange hue with a nice foamy head that dissipates rapidly. On the nose, I get some mild pine and copper malt notes, and that's about it. Once I take a sip, I get strong pine hop flavors with a light malt backbone. The mouth feel is moderate and indicative of it's 7.2% abv.     Overall, this is a solid IPA especially considering it's price and availability. However, there are better offerings which offer more complexity in flavor and aroma for a few dollars more. I've drank this brew at least a hundred times, but this is my first time to reviewing it.

But I've never taken to the lingering one-note harshness that Torpedo finishes with. To each his own, but I'd much much rather have a Lagunitas Maximus or Hop Stoopid (to name a couple that aren't too hard to find). I need things to end on a sweeter note, in life and in beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Very classic look. Smells quite nice but without anything overpowering. The taste is very similar - quite piney, with some grapefruit and an above-average maltiness for an IPA, which is alright by me. The hoppiness is prominent but not overpowering (you won't find a hoppy sensory overload here), and there's no overly bitter after-taste. Nothing jumps out at me as exceptional, but it's remarkably well-rounded and quite tasty - deserving of its reputation. It won't be my go-to IPA, but will always be a solid choice.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A great go-to IPA if you live in California as it is available everywhere here. Not my favorite but it is in my top 5. The availability is a huge plus in my book.

I'd like to thank you for destroying my palate countless times and opening up doors to bigger and better hop forward IPA's that don't rely on your one dimensional pine approach. Thanks again buddy!

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Pours a transparent deep amber/orange with a tall fluffy off-white head with lots of retention. Lacing is left during drinking.   Aroma is mostly malty, with slight hops & a bit of a sour mash scent. I was hoping for more hop on the nose. Upon tasting, I'm getting a full malt flavour with decent smooth full mouthfeel but not all that much in the hops department. There's some mild pine bitterness which lingers until the end of the sip, but not much more than that & certainly no complex combination of hop flavours - not really even quite what passes for an IPA these days. Good to try it, but definitely a one-off for me.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 I love this beer - however I'm rating it as I drink it after having a Saint Arnold's Endeavour (double IPA, probably my favorite IPA right now). This is a very bitter beer (which I love). The aroma is not quite there and it tastes very hoppy (65 IBU). Alcohol content is 7.2% but you can kinda tell that it's high, which to me is not ideal. I like high-alcohol-content beers but I like the "smooth" ones, not the ones that you can necessarily tell that are heavy in alcohol. That being said, this one gets a 4/5 in taste. Overall it's a great beer, ideal for those who like hoppy American IPA's.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Nice smooth IPA. Great foam and nice amber color. Has the right amount of bite and nice finish at the end. Definitely will buy this again. A great beer with food as well as all by itself. Will buy again.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 January 29th, 2015 - Torpedo is everywhere. EVERYWHERE. But the omnipresence is a good thing. Wherever you go in San Diego, if you need an impromptu six-pack of reasonable quality, just like the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, the Sierra Nevada Torpedo is a solid choice. The brew looks like a dark amber beer, promising a depth of flavor, which is reaffirmed in the nose. Hoppy and bready, it tells a tale of sociable bitterness, but without being heavy, sticky or sweet. The flavor is pronouncedly balanced, and while the hop profile doesn't sound out, it plays well with all the other ingredients. Slightly metallic, slightly sweet, it offers enough of interest to give a beer drinker pause, without interrupting the evening's event.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This beer poirs a very nice head, 1 finger at minimum. It has a very balanced taste with just the right amount of citrus, right amount of hops and just a tiny bit of pain. It sits well in your mouth and does not leave a bitter aftertaste. This could become a everyday beer if I would let it.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 L: This beer poured in a glass has a nice 1 1/2 fingers of head and a thick lacing in the glass.    S: The smell of citrus, hops, and a bit of pine.     T: orange , Hoppy and balanced, little floral notes of pine. Perfect balance on flavor. Nice resin backnotes.    F: feel is a bit heavy. It has a nice Creamyness to it. Great mouthfeel. Just very well balanced.    O: I love this Extra IPA just so well balanced on Hops, citrus and pine. Has perfect balance in all flavors. Mouthfeel is great. Perfect balance of hops and I'm a Hop head. Best beer I had from Sierra Nevada, great beer at 7.99 a six pack. And 7.2 Apv. Definetely in my rotation of beers.

Sierra nevada should be on the Mount Crushmore of Craft Beer ! Everything a hop head wants. Piney, cutrusy, and loaded with flavor. What I really like about torpedo is the mouth feel. Seems a bit more "creamy" than most IPAs.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Label says: PCKGD 11/14/16. Which means that someone sold me this IPA with almost one year old. Terrible idea. Poured into a BrewDog stemmed glass.    A: The body recalls a west coast IPA, having that orange-y, coppery tone with a crisp tone, absolutely no haziness. The head is white to beige, has a 1 finger thickness and besides having an average to low retention, there's some good lacing.  S: The aroma is very creamy of citrus and also some belgian candy (very weird). Almost a bit biscuity. There's a minor hoppy aroma resembling some resin and if you concentrate, you can feel the alcohol.  T: The taste begins with a citrus of orange and tangerine and also some pineapple like flavour. It then extends to the weird super sweet flavour that, for me, tastes like belgian candi but it's totally impossible to have this on such style. In the end, a mild hoppiness with a bland character.  M: Body is medium. Carbonation is great. Alcohol is in fact unnoticed. Bitterness is mild but being packaged almost one year ago, who wouldn't expect that?  O: It's a bad idea to have this without being fresh. However, there's a sense at how this beer can taste when it's fresh and I really want to try it again.

S: immediate pine and fresh orange, very juicy (and though I don't imagine this was true when originally put out) and minimal/straightforward in presentation. The pine and orange dominate with a wet lemon bringing up the rear.   T: One sip of this and the defining traits of America's brewing resurgence in the late 70's becomes clear, hoppy beers yes, but more significantly, hoppy beers with a strong malt body to back them up. I also get some phenolic notes in the form of banana and a prominent, though not overwhelming bitterness (how far we've come, no?). The bitterness is clean, with a somewhat subtle astringent pinch that is very satisfying.  M: Full bodied and sticky, but with a nice carbonation.   O: It's no sierra nevada pale ale, but hell, what is? This is a very pleasant beer that still holds up after all this time (a feat in it's own right. A testament to the skill and dedication of Ken Grossman and Co. Ken, you'll never know how much we appreciate you for helping to usher in this new age. If you've forgotten about this beer (as I had) you've made a mistake. REVISIT.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This beer is their Pale Ale on steroids. Pours a copper amber color with a spongy beige head.

Great price and readily available in my area. Wonderful beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottled 1/16/18 (29 days ago) poured into a Torpedo tulip pint glass at fridge temp 7.2% ABV. The beer pours bright light copper in color with dense off white head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is mixed with citrus, pine and caramel malt all showing up at times. The taste is resiny pine up front with semisweet caramel in the middle before sticky, piney bitterness finishes the sip. There is a hint of citrus in the taste as well. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish. Overall, excellent. This beer helped define a style years ago. I still love WCIPA's, and still enjoy Torpedo a great deal.

Taste is piney resin with a strong caramel malt backbone. With lingering earthy bitterness.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 2 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3 Pours a dark copper with a large head, lots of lacing, quite clear. Smells very citrus-y, slightly piney, a typical IPA profile. Taste is piney, but backed up too much by malt for the style. The bitterness feels like it's there just to be bitter, rather than being part of the flavor. Mouthfeel is fine; the right amount of carbonation, fairly smooth, finishes dry. By no means a standout IPA for me.

But over all a great beer for people who enjoy IPA beer but want a little more hop flavor but really aren't ready or just don't like the punch of the doubles

This gives a full 3 finger aromatic head that lasts.  The color is a copper medium light amber.  There is plenty of aroma from floral piney hops which seem like they will never end.  There is plenty of taste from hops which is a distinct citrus/pine.  Bitterness is full throughout the palate with a hint of malt which offers a pine finish. They claim 65 IBUS. I believe it! This leaves a heavy bitter hop aftertaste in the back of the palate after every sip.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I drink this often as it's a very good IPA and it doesn't break the bank. It's darker than most IPAs and tastes more like a fortified pale ale to me.

Well I guess a good way to put this is this like a double IPA with slightly less alcohol so that the hops are extremely prominent     One of the most solid IPAs I've had    Buy a case

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 This IPA pours a murky brownish orange with a fairly large foamy white head. The smell is clearly IPA, with citrus and herbal notes as the prominent components though they aren’t intense as I would have guessed, and there is also a significant sweet bready malt presence. This beer has a blend of hop flavors with herbal and pine notes being the most obvious. Some light citrus character, caramel, and toasted bread flavors round it out. The finish is fairly dry and the pine bitterness lingers a bit. The body is medium. I remember that this was probably the first extra IPA (or DIPA) I ever tried and when I first tried it about 15 years ago I thought it was amazingly bitter and not to my taste at all. Now after having lived in SD for a time and having drank a wide variety of IPAs it seems actually pretty measured, even a bit malt forward, for an extra IPA. I recognize that this is kind of a classic, but it’s not one of my favorite Sierra Nevada beers. It’s pretty basic in my opinion and I don’t really like the lingering resinous piney aftertaste in IPAs.

Some malt to offset the hops but not much. Tastes of grapefruit rind and pine resin that provides a wonderful hop bitterness that will not quit. Full smooth mouth feel despite the hoppy bitterness. Good carbonations helps with the smooth mouth fell. This is one remarkable IPA which brought me over the the IPA style. It is now my go to brew.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 The appearance has a deep orange colored body, off-white fluffy head that stayed with the beer throughout It. The smell has some bitter piney hops, slight malt backbone, but really more so as the beer warms. The taste is bitter through the piney hops, sweet only once it warmed. On the palate, its about a medium, fairly harsh on the tongue, and sessionable. There is a resinous aftertaste and finish. Overall, I’m glad I keep drinking this throughout the years as its great stuff and well worth to buy.

Malt seems like an afterthought and is thin and vaguely sweet.  Feel - Medium bodied, sharp, dry, bitterness dominates.    Overall - Recommended if you love Pine-Sol and aspirin.

This was on sale and thought I'd take her for a spin.. 12oz bottle poured into a tall glass. Nice head, still hangs around until the very end. Smell is great, taste is better than anticipated. Not too bitter. Overall, a solid IPA you can find just about anywhere.

This was the first time I'd tried this particular beer after working my way through Two Hearted Ale, Dogfish 60/90 minute, etc.    I let it set a bit as I have never enjoyed an IPA ice cold. It poured a beautiful golden amber color with a nice head into a pint glass. Generally with an IPA I am overcome with competing citrus/bitterness at first, and it takes me a while to appreciate the full flavor of the beer. This one was immediately balanced from the first sip, and stayed that way through the last.    A very good IPA for the intermediate IPA-drinker.

Waiting for the high demand and high production volume leads to the bastardization of this fine brew.   Find it, buy it, like it, save some for me. Sorry, I didn't include the this and that nuances, others have done that before me, just wanted to give a different perspective.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 From a very dated >5 month old variety IPA pack on the East Coast (dated 12-22-16 and today is 4-22-17); however, it tastes quite good, can imagine a very fresh one would be even better. Fairly standard American IPA with a lighter lager color than most, okay carbonation. Excellent and sticky lacing. flavor and mouthfeel a bit less sharp and tangy than the West Coast IPA's of Stone, but still very excellent beer.

L: Clear Copper, two finger off-white head that's super foamy and retains very well and sticks to the glass like nothing I have seen before.     S: Rich hop profile here, citrus with grapefruit, floral, leafy/herbal, spicy and pine.     T: Again, lots of hops making themselves known here, you get a citrus dash with an herbal middle and a piney finish. Really complex. Surprisingly there is a malt note hidden in there too.     F: Medium-Full, dry, below average amount of carbonation. Smooth, almost chewy.     O: Simply superb.

It's fairly carbonated and has a very thick head to it with its rich, hazy amber color. There's a blast of awesome bitter hoppy, floral, and citrus flavors that quenches the mouth every time I take a sip, most notably pineapple juice to balance out the spicy hops. Grapefruit peel is prominent in the aftertaste. It smells really great and has a combination of different scents, pine being a strong indicator.    Overall I like to have one on occasion as a delicate treat.

Half a finger head, willowy-thin.     Smells minimal. Bread, malt.     Swift, sour bread flavors charge in the vanguard, then stale grapefruit. Tangy is the initial aftertaste, tart & tangy. Pine flavor begins subtle, grows intense, yet is kept in check by the crushing carbs, dominant hops.     A zesty buzz, busy and bold.     I gave this a try back in the 90s, if memory serves, me very first Pine brew experience, a pint handed to me without any warning. Shock and revulsion. The tides of time have refined my pallet, but I have been gravitating towards the "Emperor" (Imperial) style of late, be it IPA, Red ale, or Stout.     Torpedo is a delicious, ground breaking brew! A perfect staging ground, perhaps, before moving on to a Double IPA bomber!

Poured from the bottle into a Southern Tier 2xIPA glass, the head is three fingers thick and off-white, with webbed lacing, and a rather deep golden amber body.    Smells like a solid representation of the hop characteristics mentioned on the label : citrus, pine, and herbal without being too cloying. I also get a whiff of Townhouse cracker malts. You know what I mean; buttery, cracker-y, etc.    I taste the "pine" note upfront, which also lingers to balance the underrated malt base going on help prevent such a hop-forward brew. The citrus comes into play about mid-swig to really bring out the "juiciness" of this beer.    Medium mouthfeel with mild carbonation.    Overall, I'll give Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA | Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. a 4.5.

Taste: This beer lacks a taste for the most part of the instant it touches my pallet. Until it sits in my mouth for a little bit and then I got a real kick of fruit. This was a little off touching for a general expectation for a beer.  Feel: A smooth feeling after it first hits my mouth. After I let it sit for a little bit and then swallow it there is a real tingle from the high levels of carbonation. The carbonation felt here might have been a bit too over the top for me, but still overall it was fair.

Smell: Bold, strong grapefruit followed by an undertone of pine and subtle malty bread. Smells like it's going to taste good.    Taste: Although it's described as an extra IPA, there's plenty of malts here to give it a bready taste. Hoppy sweetness and some subtle lemony tartness to balance out a flavor profile dominated by malts and pine.     Feel: Incredibly crisp on the tongue, even when pouring with more head than I probably should have. The maltiness of it gives it huge body and flavor, making it feel great to drink without it being sickly malty sweet like a heller bock. The main fruit I get out of the finish is actually watermelon; it taste much more like watermelon than Ballast Point's Watermelon Dorado. The hops finish it off with pine and bitterness.    Overall: The extra hoppiness of this one will probably take an enthusiast to appreciate, but an enthusiast will also appreciate how strikingly balanced Sierra Nevada's IPA is. Despite setting the trend for American pale ales and describing itself as an "extra" IPA, it's really the maltiness of Torpedo that makes it stand out amongst the many excellent American IPAs out there that have come to follow. Sierra Nevada is a big believer in balance, and it's really the balance of Torpedo along with the boldness of flavor that lets Torpedo stand out. While this beer might be too much for some tongues, it's absolutely iconic and just about perfect for any fan of American pale ales. The uniqueness of this masterpiece and its amazing drinkability probably makes this my favorite IPA.

This beer shows that SN is better than good, they're amazing, period. For a company that could be living off of brand recognition, Torpedo is a recent addition to their line of beer that shows they're not afraid to try something new. They hit the nail on the head. This is my favorite beer of all time, bar none. I've had IPAs that cost 5 times as much and would sell their soul to the devil to taste half as good as Torpedo. And you can buy it anywhere! 6 out of 5

look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 3.5 From the bottom of the can: "PKGD 020317 M 13:43"  Appearance: The body is mostly transparent with only a slight amount of haze. It has a nice caramel colored body with a thick, fluffy, rocky white head. Great retention and lacing.    Aroma: There isn't much aroma. I am getting some light herbal scents and it has a bit of a flowery aroma but they are very soft.    Taste: It is immediately noticeable how clean the beer is. The flavors come through very crisp and clear. Up front there is a light herbal pine flavor that flows through the mid-palate all the way to the end. It finishes with a nice woody and mossy flavor at the end.    Mouthfeel: It is a very clean and easy drinking beer. Great carbonation, great bitterness, and it is just an overall enjoyable beer to drink. It has a nice dry finish that accents the flavors.    Overall: It's a well made American IPA that you can just sit back and enjoy. I would recommend it and I would pick it up every now and then.

T:   M: full bodied, chewy, great viscosity, great full mouth feel  O: After many small batch obscure Double IPA craft beers I decided to come back to this beer that you can easily find at your local super market. I am presently surprised at how good this beer really is. If you want to intro most people into IPA'S I would start here.. Then move to Stone and go from there on their great hop quest.

I've been drinking Sierra Nevada Pale Ale for ages, so I don't know why it has take me so long to try this.

Thick creamy off white / cream colored head with moderate retention and lacing,stands 2 fingers tall.Hazy amber color with moderate clarity,and light sediment.Light carbonation.    On the nose I get piney hops,and sweet malts,some spice notes and a bit of a floral aroma.Light citrus notes as the beer starts to warm.The overall nose on this beer isn't very big at all.    On the palate Get floral hops and sweet bread malts up front,with a heavy dose of bitter piney hops in the middle,and on the back end.Also getting some spice on the back end.Light citrus flavors.    The mouth feel is medium / light,with a chalky texture.Medium dry finish,yet still smooth.    This is a very nice IPA .One I would recommend if for some reason you haven't tried yet.Have drank this one many times in the past,and will continue to drink in the future.

Not a complex flavor but a solid IPA.  Mouthfeel: Some lingering bitterness at the back of the tongue.  Overall: A good beer but not as exceptionally good as what the brothers rate it at.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I enjoyed this beer enough to buy a 6-pack after trying a single bottle sampler. It pours with a very small, but adequate head and has nice crisp carbonation bubbles for the entirety of the glass as you drink it. Nice somewhat above average IPA. I usually am unwilling to buy a 6'er of a non-Texas beer, but this one might be a winner for me. The ABV level is just about right in terms of bang for the buck for those who don't prefer Double IPA's. Overall I prefer a Double IPA, but I would definitely put this high on my list. If I see a 6'er of it, I might buy it, especially if they begin to offer it in cans.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.    Mildly hazed amber copper hue, it tops with massive creamy off-white head that stands with excellent retention before slowly sinking to an everlasting effervescence layer covering atop and leaving numerous of refined yet sticky lacing patch and spot all around, nearly flawless showcase.    Citrus, lime, pineapple, tropical fruit, melon, passion fruit, pine, grassy, some spice, and slight herbal, all of these aromas are derived from its good hop profile. Malt is also there with notes of biscuit, dough, and sweet caramel.    Very well balance taste, it is hoppy at the start with notes of pine, resin, grass, some spice, subtle herbal, citrus, and lime. Malt dwells and speaks in the undertone with its sweet, biscuit, and caramel while hop wraps up again in the finish by clean, solid, and good lingering bitterness.    Full body with good crisp and some lively carbonation through the palate, smooth mouthfeel, refreshing, finish is very pleasantly dry.    Great and a classic American IPA with very good hop profile that is very well balance with the solid malt bill.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 A personal favorite and go-to. Wonderful color and head. An ideal level of carbonation and a pleasing mouth feel. Smooth and nuanced at the beginning with what I consider the most delightful bitter finish. If I'm in the mood for an IPA Torpedo always delivers. Not to mention it's notably cheaper than the next best "find it most anywhere" IPA, Bell's Two Hearted Ale. I recommend you try both, excellent foundation to develop a taste for IPAs, not to mention they both are ideal for a comfortable session.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 The nose is pretty basic (dry piney hop scent, tiny bit of floral citrus notes) but hey it's the taste that really counts. Taste is pretty much matches the nose to an T. Nice medium body mouthfeel. Sierra Nevada is the embodiement of "if it ain't broke don't fix it". This is probably my favourite ipa and one of my daily drinkers. Nice bitter IPA with a medium body. 7.2% abv, enough to be good after one or two. But not too high so it wouldn't be hard to drink a 6pack on a hot summer day. Also it's usually always on sale where I live (eastern NC) somewhere for $13 a case. All around a near perfect beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 What I like about Sierra Nevada is that you can always expect a nice blend of hops with a strong malt bill. On the nose, this one is no different. Big malt scent along with melon and citrus when digging deeper into the nose. Scent translates to the flavor. Immediate malt flavor with some mild citrus and piney bitterness lasting through the finish. Well carbonated with zero alcohol heat. Pretty easy drinking with nice balance.

From a bottle into a snifter  Best Before 25 August 2017  IBU: 65    APPEARNCE: Pours a three finger, frothy, creamy white head with excellent retention. Perfectly clear tangerine orange with medium levels of carbonation. Head foams up and slowly fades to a full foamy cap and leaves foamy lacing on the glass. A foamy wisp remains leaving chunky lacing on the glass as it empties.     SMELL: Pale malts, some melon, plenty of grassy and hay-like character, and a touch of citrus aroma on the nose. Barnyard qualities in this one.     TASTE: Pale malts, some hay and melon notes up front. The barnyard qualities to this one are pretty evident. A medium but lingering finish of pale malts, grain, flavors of grass and hay, light notes of citrus fruits and some hop bitterness linger. This is closer to a bitter Belgian pale with some light funk.     PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Plenty creamy and frothy on the palate, goes down fine and finishes a touch on the drier side. Some light bitterness lingers.     OVERALL: A good beer but not my favorite take on an American IPA. This one’s got a good deal of grass and barnyard character to it, which reminds me very much of some of my favorite Belgian strong pale ales. This is not a hoppy, citrus forward example of the style, which is what I look forward to when picking up bottles marked “IPA.” Worth checking out if you like hoppier, more bitter Belgian style strong pales, but not if you’re up for an American hop bomb.

I accidentally ordered this when I misread the Torpedo as being a Stout, but I was very impressed with this IPA's balance, particularly given my fear of hop-bombery with the "extra" label. I recall the head being very full and fluffy. Overall, this was an enjoyable beer that I think will stand out particularly as a food pairing.

I would rather have sierra's original pale ale although the torpedo does have a 7 abv vs 5.5, however when it comes to ipa Founders centennial or Bells two hearted wins me over. Still this a delicious beer if you have it. I prefer only getting it when it comes in variety packs but would never get it on its own unless you never tried it. Sierra has a black iPa that out does the torpedo as well does their hoppy lager. But I must say this beer is perfect for spring, summer, and fall months. It is delicious with its bitter hops but just doesn't excite me as others on the market. And yes it's best in a tulip glass and color is a golden orangish brown color. It also tastes good straight from the bottle.

Its bold and complex aroma is reminiscent of the Sierra Nevada mountains: pine, citrus, and a host of other herbal varieties which are insufflated up your sniffer so when you chug it down you are actually well prepared for the hoppy storm that's soon to come. I've found myself many times pouring a bottle into a large wine glass so I can really smell its aroma as I sip it down. For the more advanced beer drinkers, I recommend throwing a straw into the cup and shoving the top end up your right nostril while plugging the other with your finger. Let out all the air you can from your mouth until there is none left in your lungs then finally inhale as hard as you can through your nose for a glorious onslaught of taste, smell, and mind-numbing feelings. I've easily downed a full bottle in one breath this way and must say the buzz I get is unlike any other.

Just a little malt to even things out.    O: Hops aren't overdone and very well balanced. I need to try one that is a little more fresh next time to see if the hoppy flavors will come out more.

Aroma: Surprisingly faint for a beer so insanely hopped. Notes of vanilla, grapefruit, pine sap and mild coconut.    Taste: Bitter upfront, but not overtly so, with notes of pine and grapefruit peel. An understated, soft, creamy pale malt flavor kicks in mid palate, contributing notes of freshly baked biscuits and sugar cookies... following that are more flavors of bitter orange pith and pineapple. Flavors of coconut, pistachio nuts, white chocolate and finally more bitter pine follow on the finish.    Feel: Moderately bitter throughout, but with a nice dry tropical fruit and vaguely sweet pale malt backbone to back it up. Alcohol is detectable, but not distracting and actually quite pleasant after a while.    Overall: I thought this was going to be another overrated BA primadona, but Torpedo exceeded my expectations. It's overtly hoppy, but oddly drinkable and balanced. If you're not afraid of big beers, try this out - just make sure you're buying fresh bottles - as the taste of the hops will fade over time effectively destroying the flavor.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Good old Torpedo - brings a very strong bitter pine/resin IPA crispness. Doesn't offer a tremendous amount of nuance beyond that, but is satisfying through the whole swig and lasts on the palate well beyond the point that you finished it (you can still taste it after you finished it and that's both a good thing and not just the alcohol lingering).    Highly recommended to anyone who fancies a good bitter IPA and doesn't want to go hunting for exotic breweries.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 355ml bottle. Bottled on April 2nd 2016, drank on August 3rd 2016.    Appearance: pours beautiful amber with 3 finger head of small bubbles that stays there for a long time. Very good lacing.    Smell: took a sniff from the bottle and knew I was in for a treat. Great floral, piny and fruity aromas: cantaloupe, pear, red apple and a little peach come to mind. A little of a honey and bourbon character too. Absolutely amazing.    Taste: piney and fruity as the smell with a strong malty backbone that makes it a solid beer. The hoppiness is really balanced, not agressive nor astringent.    Mouthfeel: light to medium bodied, but you feel the hoppiness in the mouth for a long time. Not astringent but finishes dry.    Overall: my first IPA ever, and I think this is a great great beer. Very well balanced between hoppiness and malt, great look, smell and taste.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Torpedo pours with beefy eggshell white foam that leaves decorative lacing nothing short of lovely. The body is a little clouded and its deep tawny amber colour is a shade or two darker than many IPAs. That said, it looks absolutely afire when held above eye level and has a complexion resembling a fully illuminated stain glass window.     Just when IPAs were starting to feel redundant, leave it to a widely available ten year veteran to rekindle my interest. This aroma had me fully captivated from the first sniff. There are many dimensions to this one, ranging from leafy and resinous to zestful and spicy to citrusy and just a touch tangy. It's fetching in a way only whole-cone hopped beers can be.     There's also a noticeable amount of toasty, buttery-sweet malt, a feature that also plays out on the palate. The pine and candied citrus are still there, but there's a reliable amount of nutty, caramelized grain they've got to compete with, especially in the finish. The two sets of flavours compliment each other splendidly.     The question must be asked: what makes Torpedo an "Extra" IPA? Admittedly, it has a lot less restraint than is typically for a Sierra Nevada beer but it still pales in intensity compared to other American IPAs. On the spectrum of "hop bomb" to "hop sparkler" this probably ranks as a "hop grenade". It's impactful but not maximum damage.     Sierra Nevada's branding is modest and elementary, but also consistent and charismatic - their recipes are much the same. Torpedo is probably their boldest regular offering yet still has the brewery's trademark approachability, balance and purity of flavour. It's these reasons I appreciate it even more now than when I first tried it 8 years ago.

Dark Amber color, citrusy hoppy scent and flavor, taste and mouthfeel are great but the finish is what I love best about this one. It sits on your tongue for a solid minute or two after swallowing. This is one you just sip and savor.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Canned on 06/09/16.    A - Pours a nice clear, deep color with a thick, frothy bright white head that's very sticky on the sides of the glass.    S - A hint of herbalness, and dominated by spicy pine aroma with a thick sweet caramel malt.    T - Follows the nose. Strong caramel malt backbone followed with citrus, and towards the end the palate gets hit with an assertive dose of piney resin bitterness that scrubs the sweetness away and then morphs into a lingering pine/bitter grapefruit bitterness (with a little bit of floral buried in the mix).    M - Thick and full bodied with a little bit of boozy effervescence permeating up to the sinuses.    O - It's been a long time since I've had this beer and can"t figure out why I never reviewed it before (probably because it's been so hard to find in my area anywhere close to fresh). I forgot how good and how solid this beer is and for the price point, it's hard to beat. Should be a staple IPA in my beer fridge.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 The Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA, at 7,2% abv.  Style: American IPA    Look: Dark orange, reddish colour. Very hazy, with a 2 finger brown/white head. Good carbonation    Smell: Heavy aromas. Lots of hoppy & pine aromas, floral, with hints of citrus flavors. Also sweet malt characteristics    Taste: Well balanced, hoppy , bitter & spicy with malty sweetnes. Mild carbonation    That is an awesome beer, really. Strong aromas, very tasty. Never felt like a 7,2% abv. Extremely drinkable. A proper IPA. Cheers   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 If I were judging this beer purely on value, it would be near 100. Always less than $15 for a 12 pack. However, I judge beers as compared to others in the style. That doesn't mean I don't think this is a great beer, just can't consider this to be on par with so many great IPA's out there. It is a great beer though and I will continue to buy this regularly because it's tough to beat the taste combined with the price and availability.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Exceptional. Towards the top of my favorite IPAs and quite a bit better than regular Sierra Nevada Pale IMHO due to the fact it's just not as bitter. 
look: 4.25 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 4 Looks golden-amber, like apple-juice. Has a frothy blonde head    Smells like dirt.    Taste something sweet, initially, with something spicy as well, something like coriander, but I cannot identify it. Seems to better in big swigs. Has an extremely bitter, grapefruit-seed after-taste that really digs in and entrenches itselfinto the palate. Fades to sweet linger. Getting better as I'm going.     Has a biting mouth-feel.    Good, but not nearly as good as what the BA score says. Worth a try, but I'm not having this again, not with the plethora of other, better IPAs out there. Don't believe all the hype. Probably, this would be VERY GOOD for someone who likes extremely bitter IPAs.

Look: Dark amber color, close to copper. Small half finger white head, which lapses into a ring.    Smell: Sweet floral hops. along with pine, resin, and citrus fruits.    Feel: Medium bodied, closer to the light side, with mild carbonation, Easy drinkablity.    Taste: Bitter hops balance citrus and tropical fruits perfectly along with sweet malts.    Overall: Perfectly balanced IPA; tons of bitter hops, malts, and fruit characteristics.

No sense in me repeating what millions of other have said and I am not into "foo-foo" beer reviews so I will just leave it at that.   Although ABV is not reaIly a double IPA - I do like to have one of these about 45 minutes before bedtime :)     This is not wine (thankfully)  It is beer  It is good beer  You should drink good beer

Smells of pine and a bit of malt. Flavor is a little bit of malt, citrus that fades into pine. Solid hoppy bitterness throughout. Flavor does linger for a while afterwards. Body is medium with a little carbonation to it. Overall solid beer that is well worth trying and something enjoyable for those who are really into hops.

Smell – 4.25-   Smells mildly hoppy (not getting any real citrus smell) with a more apparent malt background.   Taste – 4.25 –   Straight up dank hop bitterness. Lovin it. Almost a sour malt flavor.  Feel- 4 –   Medium body with moderate carbonation, very smooth with a nice warm alcohol feel to it.  Overall- 4.25 – The extra hoppiness adds a great bitterness that isn't citrusy. Good smells and good feel. Would drink again.

Smells of biscuit malt, honey, and fresh citrusy hops.     Taste is biscuit malt, maple, caramel, piney and floral hops, and a papery malt and woody hop finish.     Medium body with fluffy carbonation.     Solid IPA, good aroma, pretty pour. Flavor could stand to have a little more richness on the malty side. Bready notes are a little stale feeling. The hops balance fine. Not very fruity which is fine, but perhaps surprising for a west coast brewery. Drinks heavy. Overall solid and worth trying.

Smell: Hops and pine; A hint of something fruity; pineapple?    Taste: Although there's the slightest hint of malt upfront, overall this one's a  bit overly one-dimensional for my taste; Heavy citrus that builds on the palate.    Feel: well balanced.    Overall: Wanted to like this one, but for anyone who wants/needs a little malt/sweet  pushback in their single/double IPA's, this one comes up short. Can't recommend  SN's 2016 Big Foot Barleywine enough though, if you want a beer that offers sweet  and bitter in the same glass.

Leaves a creamy foam of 1/3 inch that lasts.  You get a smell of floral, pine, orange, apricot.. man this beer has some strong flavors.  Perfect taste. If you're an ipa guy you would love this one.   Just a perfect flavor that is so well balanced and crisp.     Look for the date on this beer. If you can get it within 10 days of the bottled date like I did you are in for a treat. When it is 4-8 weeks old you can tell the difference.     Great beer

Smell: Smells a bit earthy, citrusy, and malty.  Taste: Wonderful bitter taste (but not too much). Citrus and pine. Woodsy hops.   Mouth Feel: Smooth like melted caramel and thick on the palate. Great feeling beer that goes down smoothly. Such and easy drinker I missed my first bottle and had to have two (darn it!)

The 7.2% ABV is a bit of an ass-kicker, but what do you expect from a beer called "Torpedo" and described as an "Extra IPA".    Amber colour, leaning almost reddish; Huge puffy head, great lacing. Lots of pine, herbs, dankness, citrus peel, fruit pith, biscuity malt. . . . Slobberingly good, and the taste delivers the same profile. Light-ish body, gentle alcohol warmth, medium carbonation.    What a beer. What a lovely all-around beer.

Like bottled late afternoon sunlight. Rich, small bead white cap with good lacing.    Aroma: Earthy, spicy hops, rich malt core, good interplay between the two.    Taste: Tasty hops announce the entry like a trumpet voluntary. Rich caramel malts follow with hops sailing above the solid malt structure. This is good stuff. Finish is is the reverse with hops away followed by rounded rich malt. It's 7.2 % ABV, you mean I can have only one? Aw, man.    Texture: As full as one could ask.    Overall: Someone is on their game here, the hop mixture used is beautifully balanced. The malt core is sufficient to counter the hops and the whole just works so well together. I thought the high hop level might be a bit off putting . . . I was wrong.

The glass is smothered in lacing after each sip. Minor notes of citrus, and pine hops. Smells rather quaint. Citrus and tropical hops make up an easy-going, but hoppy flavor profile. Mouth feel is border line DIPA territory, with plenty of body, and yet feels more like a thick, filling IPA. Overall, a fantastic brew that warrants any beer drinker's attention. Simplistic, and easy drink make this a beer for most any occasion.    Served in a 12oz snifter.

It takes me about 6 months to finish a keg, so I guess it says something that I liked it well enough to drink it for the next 6 months. Shiner makes a Wicked Ram IPA and this is definitely better than it. A bit more expensive though, worth it.

The taste is very hoppy, one of the hoppier beers I've tasted. Overall this a great beer for anybody who loves a nice hoppy beer.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured hazy copper with 1 in fluffy white head that had great retention and lacing. Scent was piney hops, though a bit reduced compared to the bold flavor. Flavor why heavy on the hops, primarily pine/bitter hops. Nice balanced malt flavor to round the beer out. Heavy carbonation pairs well with the high bitterness.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 The taste is delicious but very distinct. It's noticeably bitter with an undeniable pine taste. It's awfully good, but perhaps a little to distinct for me to drink all the time. It tastes like someone figured out how to bottle Northern California. BTW, it keeps growing on me.

Not a long lasting head, diminished quickly and left the beer looking a bit flat. Nice copper color, almost like a red ale. An earthy aroma is predominant with this beer. The same is with the flavor. The hops flavor is a mix of pine and spice. Rich malty sweetness is in the finish, along with some pine bitterness. A very unique and flavorful IPA overall.

Aroma was plenty of c hops, says there is citra I believe, but sparingly used.     Taste hits some bitter notes, Simcoe and Magnums, Cascade in everything SN. Plenty heavy hop usage and solid bitterness, malt bill is nothing to sneeze at either, they got plenty of earthy notes, melange of toffee and caramel, unsweetened all around.     Great price, great consistency, high turnover, almost always fresh.

Pine and orange/grapefruit pit predominate - bitter sweet with a fair amount of astringency and a palate cleansing finish. Soapy, medium bodied texture, hoppy bitter twang endures, but not unpleasant.    Great price point for this high quality IPA - and excellent representative of the style. Not my cup of tea, but I recognize its merits and would recommend to those seeking a pine predominant IPA

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Everything you have read about this beer is absolutely true. It is amazingly delicious. Pleasantly dry and hoppy, a little smokey, floral, umami. It's like drinking a fine liquid cigar. There are many higher priced ipas that would fall to their knees and pay homage to this benchmark of what an IPA should be. Beautiful sticky liquid lacing my glass maintaining a nice head and lingers on the tongue like the best morning cup of coffee. Robust, toasty, rich, not too heavy. This is the best beer I have ever had. Very drinkable...I can drink all six without palate fatigue. I love this beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a pretty clear copper in color with a finger of very light khaki head. Aroma is decidedly malty with a heavy emphasis on caramel malts. The taste has a solid and prominent hop bitterness, the caramel malts and again present and there isn't much in the way of hop flavor. Al the hop additions seem to have been very early in the boil. Decent mouthfeelwith a light-medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall this is a decent beer but I don't feel it fits what I would call the exceptionally broad category of American IPA. Hops are definitely the focus here but it's in a buttering capacity rather the aromas and flavors the label would have you believe.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Poured from a 12oz bottle into a flared pilsner glass.    Appearance: Opaque dark copper colour with a fluffy head which recedes quickly. As you might expect from an American / Imperial IPA, with every sip it leaves an obstinate ring of foam on the glass.     Aroma: Citrus and pine resin along with malt sweetness. Pretty standard for an APA.    Taste: Upfront piney hops melding into bitterness and a sweet malt backbone. Slight taste of booze in the background. Again, fairly standard for the style, but still well-rounded and enjoyable.    Mouthfeel: Medium body with light carbonation and a lingering bitter / piney aftertaste. Very dry. Exactly what I look for in a good APA.    Overall: there are APAs I enjoy more (Bell's Two-Hearted especially comes to mind), but this is not offensive at all, and in fact is rather enjoyable. Recommended for fans of big and bold IPAs.

Flavor follows much the same, though the malt backbone is overwhelmed through the course of 12oz, as the fairly bitter aftertaste builds and dominates. I really like this stuff for the first half of the glass, the the aftertaste wears on me.

Smells like a fresh mountain morning with pine and floral hops shining through. Seems to be some citrus smell far in the background.    Taste is very balanced for an "Extra IPA". The hops jump out front but are quickly backed by some very nice sweet malt characters.    Mouth feels fairly light but borders on medium in the back of the swallow. Very refreshing mouth feel in all.    I really have to say Sierra Nevada has a big winner on their hands with this one! A very tasty and refreshing balanced IPA with a whopping 7.2 ABV that does not show in the taste. Ver nice beer and worth a ride. Cheers!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Seems to me the going rate for an "augmented" or double IPA these days is around $10-$12/six. I just found this at $10, which is great, but having regular SV right next to it made no sense to me. Put is this way: SV P/A is the SV Lite of this much better beer.     Someone below uses the term "white grapefruit flesh" and that is right on. Big bit bite of the grapefruit, nice malt wave, and pine on the finish.     I would venture to say if English bitter is not your taste, this beer may not be for you.    From what I can see, this should be SV's flagship beer. At $10, it's a steel; at $12, try Stone, Victory, or Double Bastard instead.    Paired with Szechuan chicken stir fry, very nice with hot peppers.

Lots of lacing. Smell is very piney, with some citrus notes. Taste is unbalanced, in my opinion. Very bitter without any other flavors coming through besides pine and sheer bitterness, just kind of a one note beer. Feel is medium with moderate carbonation, somehow feels a lot more boozy than I would expect for 7.2% ABV. Finishes very dry, with lingering bitterness. I guess if you're a major hop head, it's worth checking out, but I found it hard to enjoy.

But, no one (including me) should fault the success of this brewery... but their use of hops makes me shy.

Poured medium to somewhat heavy.     S – Piney hops, with some mixed tropical fruit in the background. A fairly heavy bread crust, biscuit malt profile holds up the hops.     T – Pine, resin, a bit of grapefruit in there somewhere. Malt profile is very prominent, mostly bread crust.    M – A medium-full body thanks to the malts, with moderate carbonation only. Moderate hop bitterness though it escalates a bit on the finish.     O – Overall, a serviceable IPA, though I don’t know that it stands out much from the pack anymore.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Definitely outstanding. One of my favorite American IPAs. Just has taken me a while to rate it, so here it is. Pours a nice copper straw color with a nice bubbly and foamy head. Smell has a hint of malt but is dominated mostly by hops with some piney notes. Taste is similar. Malt, pine and hops. Finishes dry with a little bitterness. Home run Sierra Nevada.

Smells of citrus zest, sliced orange, stone fruit, reserved caramel malt and piney hops.    Tastes of white grapefruit flesh, bitter orange, peach cobbler, biscuity caramel malt and more pine resin.    Feels sturdy and refreshing. Medium-light bodied with firm carbonation. Finishes dry.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 This beer pours a rich amber with a generous head. The aroma gives me sticky pine, a touch of tangerine, and pineapple. The flavor starts with rich whole grain malts, followed by a pleasant dose of pine, tropical fruits, and a hint of citrus. The mouthfeel is full and fizzy. Overall this is a very pleasant well contructed brew that I honestly have not tried up until now.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Always want to rate this very underrated beer from Sierra Nevada now brewed in NC (Mills River).    Nice Color ..lets say more orange than amber .. creamy head   Aroma does have the west coast hop and mellow malt coming through,  The taste is full of citrus then the toasted malt is there.  Medium mouthfeel ... nice carbonation and very smooth    Overall this beer is one that is an IPA and DIPA all in one ...  Sierra Nevada has got this down to a science   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Look: Dark amber color, pours a finger of head that dies down but never fully diminishes.    Smell: Bright hops with a solid punch of west coast pine and a slight sweetness.    Taste: Big hop presence on the front end followed again by a tight pine flavor. Transitions quickly into a heavy malt profile which balances the strong hops very well. The finish is of a prickly bitterness with a residual citrus note. That finishing taste lingers for quite a while and is excited nicely right back into the hops of the next sip.    Overall: This beer is a classic and admittedly has always been a go-to of mine. What separates this beer from a lot of the IPAs coming out now a days is the incredible balance of the beer. Each flavor from the hops on the front end, to the malt in the middle, and finishing with the bitterness on the backend is perfectly in balance with one another. Torpedo may not be the biggest hop bomb, citrus explosion IPA out there but it is a damn well balanced IPA, and for the price, cannot be beat. Make sure you check the date though and pick it up as fresh as you can. I have seen this beer on the shelf well past 5 months from the bottling date, almost guaranteeing that your buying a malt bomb. Fresh however, an amazing beer and a perfect example of a west coast IPA.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 355ml bottle bought for $6, poured into a pint glass.    Look: Deep auburn colour, slight caramel colour to two inch head, dissipating into half-decent lacing    Smell: Large hoppy smell initially, decent hints of citrus (grapefruit, orange, lime) slight hint of caramel sweetness    Taste: Akin to smell, initial heavy bitterness, bitter sweet after taste, citrus and caramel.    Feel: Pleasant carbonation, medium bodied, slight alcohol noticeable around tongue and cheeks    Overall: This was one of my first IPA (Feral Hop Hog being the first) and it is probably the best imo.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 A: A vibrant and clear copper. Fluffy white head with decent retention.    S: Mostly floral aromas with hints of pine and grassy notes.    T: Hops are at the forefront. Slightly spicy in the beginning, moves to a malty sweetness, and finishes with a clean citrus bitterness with notes of pineapple, berry, and peaches (I assume from Citra hops).    Mouthfeel: Surprisingly light and refreshing, despite the darker than gold color. The crystal malts provide sweetness (balance) and darker color with little effect on the fullness of the body.    Overall: A pleasantly complex beer. The malt build and bittering hops balance the beer without getting in the way of the star of the show, the Citra hops. The finishing flavors of these hops will take minutes to fully develop. While they are in the process of developing, enjoy the show, as you will discover new flavors by the second.    Cheers to this one.

T- Dank and resinous all the way, coats the palate, but the hopinness fades out right in the aftertaste leaving a slightly sweet malty touch. Orange rind, floral hops, grapefruit, melon.

look: 3 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 I'm not gonna pretend I'm so beerophile and give some detailed account of a liquid beverage. I love beer and especially IPAs. I prefer citrusy/grapefruit ipa's first of all, and this beer is just too hop forward and not drinkable enough. Too bitter and actually makes me nauseous. Leaves a lingering terrible aftertaste. Headache type of buzz Ipa. This IPA would be a 5 star ipa 5 years ago but today it's terribly outdated and weak. Not a fan. Could just be my preference but I like refreshing, and this stuff is draining and tiresome. I could see why some people like this but for me it's old hoppy hat, longing for some refreshing hydrating citrus. Did I mention it gives me a stomach ache? Yeah this stuff kinda blows. And I love good IPAs. Oh well. Its tasty don't get me wrong, but just not my style at all. Every IPA lover should try this though, as it is unique.

Pleasant, the usual citrus and pine, but you really have to dig in and snort it to find it. Taste is nice, hops forward, the bitterness leading with just the slightest amount of sweet malt in the background, which is a nice change of pace from the usual sweetness into bitterness schtick. Mouthfeel is fantastic, just enough texture to let you know it means business but not overly oily or syrupy. This is a fantastic brew.

Poured into a pint, a brassy color with a light, pleasant haziness to it. Perfect, creamy, aromatic head that retains well and honestly just makes the beer look so good.  I have an awful nose, so I'm not the best to ask on the subject of that but this beer had a lot of good smell to it. Citrus, pine, herbs.  Taste is dreamy and perfect. Sweet but tart. Refreshing, but bitter. Fruit rind with just the right amount of spiciness. Floral and earthy notes, as well as citrus and even sort of... melon?? Then it hits hard with hoppy, herbal, bitterness that will make any hop head very happy. The dankness tones down into a subtle malty finish. This is a good beer for a flavor journey. mouthfeel is easy and pleasant. Perfectly drinkable. Very slight tingle of carbonation.  Overall I loved this beer. Its 7.2% alcohol so I'm not planning to finish this sixer tonight, a couple have left me feeling good. Personally enjoyed Sierra Nevada Hop Hunter more than I did this beer but this is definitely worth the acclaim.

The bitterness lingers for awhile before dancing away into the sunset (Or in my mind it does) Absolutely fantastic.    F- Nice crisp beer. The way the bitterness dissipates is absolutely fantastic.

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Orange body, prodigious carbonation, perfect clarity. The head deserves its own paragraph, but in a sentence, off-white, velvety, building itself into a mountain of smooth isohumulone alpha-acids and protein chains, dense, creamy, bitter, and utterly beautiful. The nose is intense with the bitterness of the usual orange peel, grapefruit, and pine notes, with some sweeter pineapple and apricot notes, faint malt. Taste favors the fruit, particularly grapefruit, but gives more reign to the bready caramel malt than the nose does, yet remains dry. Medium body, crisp carbonation.  It's got plenty of diverse hop notes, just enough mature malt to balance it out, and the right refreshing body to tie it all together. An everyday gem.

A nice amount of carbonation (slightly more than average intensity).     O: Overall, this is a great IPA with great tropical fruit flavors and a great mouthfeel.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bottle dated 9/15/2015, now almost four months later. Don't know if it is an accurate portrayal, but I digress. Poured into a small pint glass. The color is a beautiful amber gold, with some cool lacing dissipating quickly. A small ring of foam stays on top throughout drinking.    Smell is absolutely nice, but is Extremely faint. Lots of fruity, rad hops, but I would love if it was about 5x more robust. The taste is quite different from the smell, with a strong bitter component and piney, resinous compliments. Leaves a bitter taste that is not too unpleasant. Very drinkable, I could put back about 5, but satisfying enough in the belly to not need to.    I wish that it was a bit more liberal with the flavors, but what it does right is the refined balance I've come to expect from Sierra Nevada's hoppy selections. They all seem quite reserved from my albeit limited experience. I like really loud, citrusy IPA's I must admit. I can definitely see the appeal to these beers; strangely enough the '15 Celebration with it's lower alcohol content had me buzzing a tad more.    Would certainly love to give it a go on tap or perhaps with a more recently bottled batch. Maybe I am missing out, and these have sat on the shelf for a while, but I have tried one or two from the style that stand out more (this beer seems to get a lot of hype on here).    Cheers!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 From a 3-week-old bottle, pours a deep clear copper. 3 fingers of dense, off-white foam lasts forever, then leaves plenty of lacing. Smell is bready malt with earthy herbal hops as well as literal earth (dirt), but not in a bad way. Some spicy pine and fruitiness as well. Taste is the same, with a bit of bitterness in the finish. Nice medium feel. Overall a good IPA, maltier and less citrusy than most these days, but a solid choice nonetheless.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this one yet. The pour is a moderately deep amber in color with plenty of red in it. The head has great retention and lacing and is a great, creamy froth. The scent is a mild to moderate punch of hops, subtlely balanced with a touch of sweetness. When the beer hits the tongue, a mild burst of piney hops preside throughout most of the front half of the drink. The back half of the drink displays a bit of malt underneath the bitterness that balances the drink nicely. Mouthfeel is smooth and decently thick, but still light enough to drink it.    Overall, this is one of the standards of IPA. Nothing terribly flashy, but always a solid pour and drink.
