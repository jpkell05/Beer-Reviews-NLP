look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pale amber color, brilliantly clear. Pours a tightly bubbled white head with good retention.    Delicate noble hop aroma, some caramel sweetness, but overall just a nice, clean nose.    Nice mix of malty sweet and some spicy hop notes early. Overall very well balanced, and has a mix of sweetness and hop bitterness into the finish. Ultimately finishes slightly bitter.    Medium body and carbonation. Very unobtrusive mouthfeel.    Was stunned to realize that for all of the times I'd consumed this beer over the last 20+ years, I'd never reviewed it here. Always a bit surprised by the assertiveness of the hops in the finish. Is a classic for a reason, and definitely a beer that would be easy to put down in volume. A crushable beer that dates to a time before that term was in fashion!

This gives a 3 finger head.  The color is a beautiful copper amber.  The aroma is a nice hops with a touch of malt.  The taste is citrusy/malt up front with a slight citrus/pine toward the back of the palate.  Nice blended, rich bodied hoppy/malt mid palate with a finish of piny hops.

Smells of caramel , yeast bread, cereal, slight herbal spice.  Tastes of equal parts caramel maltiness and biscuit/breadiness, with earthy minerally undertones and slight herbal spice.   Medium body, medium carbonation.  Overall, exceptional in its subtle complexity for a so-called vienna style lager. It is malt and biscuit dominant as expected, but the with earthy, mineral, slight herbal-spice qualities as well. I could drink this forever and never tire of it.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 | overall: 2.5 I'm more of a fan of the seasonal Sam Adams beers as they go down easier, but this is an extremely bitter and overpowering beer that is really meant to be a sipper. My favorite part is when you swallow and you can taste the caramel and it starts to become sweet then the aftertaste is metallic and extremely bitter and unenjoyable. This is best enjoyed with a steak or something that can help hide the power of the hops here.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 This review is based on Boston Lager brewed in the UK by Shephard and Neame so I cannot compare it to the USofA brew but given the high standards of the brewer it will be probably similar. It has a delightful copper colour shaming the yellow mass produced UK lager. The head white and high did diminish quickly. It has a reasonable hoppy taste not normally found in standard lager however. I good beer smell too. I am not a lager drinker by choice but would drink this brew on a red hot day when lager/pils etc chills better than a fine ale.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Pours a clear, pale amber coloration with a medium, frothy, lasting head. Smell is dominated by bready, caramel malt, with just the merest hint of citrus hops and honey. Taste follows the nose, with caramel, bready, grainy malts at the forefront, being back up by rather light citrus/herbal hops. Finishes more sweet than bitter, with a light metallic/medicinal note developing in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a light/medium body and medium carbonation. This would make for a rather pleasant, if not terribly exciting Lager if it wasn't for that somewhat harsh metallic/medicinal aftertaste, which is not really that bad, but a little unpleasant nonetheless.

Since my most recent was a Boston Lager a few days ago, I'll add this one. Definitely mild and drinkable, more pronounced hops than a macrobrew, yet enough to appeal to those who previously drank swill all those years and said, "hey, there's flavor in this bottle!" My hat's off to Jim Koch, who created Boston Lager, and when he got our attention, he offered many more pleasurable beer styles. Enjoy so many of his Noble Pils, porters and stouts and it began with a Boston Lager.

That soapy aftertaste M. mentioned is kind of present, but not anything terrible. Getting in the vicinity of hoppitude. This despite a 30 IBU rating. Maybe they’re actually putting soap in the mix. The finish is definitely soapy. I think I have two or three more of these in the fridge from my variety pack, and they ain’t that good. Yeesh. 2017/09/11

Shows up Tobacco amber/brown and it's perfectly, perfectly clear. Great appearance really. The tase... uh yeah well about that. A little bitter and thin for a lager of any kind. Not malty enough...really? Shallow and One dimensional. 1 and 2. The feel is good, but the carbonation is just barely enough... The musta been a hit in the 90's or so? Great crisp and clean finish though. And a happy ending (glad it's over). My judgment on the beer: a foul tip.  Won't repeat.  I appreciate SA as an entity, but just can't get on board with their palate.     Might make a good 2 tone with a cheap unlikable stout.

S- Fresh grains and toasty malts, promising.  T- Immediately toasty, and that builds. If blind-folded I certainly wouldn't suggest this could be a lager. I think it tastes more like something between a bitter and pale ale, It's pleasant but not quite what I expected.  M- It's got a prominent feel, I don't think I could make a session beer of it.   O- Perhaps a better style for me in autumn/winter.  Bought in London (Waitrose?). No BB to be found on the lables, glass, nor cap...

Decent lacing on glass while drinking.    Breaddy smell mainly, picking up hint of spice.    Malty and sweet on the front, get some caramel taste but then that bit of herbal spice at the end.     It’s very well balanced, perfect amount of hops to offset the caramel. Easy drinking.    Overall it’s a very solid beer. Like most, one of the beers that got me away from macros into craft brews. It’s a very enjoyable beer that fits in the middle ground that can stay in the fridge and be enjoyed by macro and craft drinkers alike.

Coats my plate well, somewhat heavy...but not too heavy. I find that I could still sit and have a few of these now and again. It is still a refreshing, clean and easy drinking beer...even though my tastes have migrated to the "hoppy side" of the spectrum.

Look - It's refreshing to buy a commercial beer that has rich amber color instead of the usual straw colored lagers  Head is decent and lingers with good lacing. Only moderate carbonation.  Smell - First thing i get is some spice, some fruit. Also getting almost a belgian-like yeast, and hint of hops. Smells like freshly brewed which is why Sam Adams got the "craft beer" label in the first place, certainly not typical mass-beer.  Taste - it does taste like a Belgian beer but it doesn't dominate the palate. Also getting some sweet tropical flavors, a bitter wave of hops that i personally really enjoy, finishes with malt. Really easy to drink, not a light beer by any means but not egregiously filling. Carbonation is below average which is nice, less burping than an average beer.   This isn't my favorite beer style but this is a very solid beer that i buy at least yearly.   I give this excellent beer a grade of A

Light carbonation, muted bitterness. I felt any aromas present were hard to detect but from what I gather it was sweet - perhaps more banana than citrus - and pleasant. More malt than hop. Anyway, good overall crisp tasting beer.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 The left side of the label says "FOR BREWERY-FRESH TASTE, ENJOY BEFORE MONTH NOTCHED" with a mark over "AUG 2018"    Appearance: The beer has a brilliantly clear body. The body has a nice copper color with light amber and gold as light passes through. The head is large, white, and rocky.    Aroma: There is a slightly spicy smelling hop aroma with hints of wild flower.    Taste: There isn't a lot of flavor here. It starts out with a bit of alcohol and herbal hops, with a touch of tea-like earthy flavor. The middle is pretty empty. The finish is where this beer really shines. It has this caramel flavor which feels very clean.    Mouthfeel: Wet, easy to drink, light, with a body that sits about 3/4 on the light-to-medium scale. A very faint herbal bitterness in the finish.    Overall: There is nothing interesting or unique about this beer. It rests comfortably at the lower end of Vienna Lagers. It has enough character that is worth drinking but it never tastes especially fresh. I recommend it in a scenario where you can't find a better beer, but overall there are better Vienna Lagers on the market in the U.S.

Taste: Bitter malt, without the hop or really the citrus flavor that the nose would suggest.    Mouthfeel: Pretty thick for a lager, with minimal carbonation.    Overall: I'm not too sure on this one. It's supposed to be a Vienna Lager, but it ends up tasting more like an IPA that's gone off.

look: 4 | smell: 2 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 This beer pours a medium amber color. The head of the beer is very light and dissipates quickly. The aroma is slightly spicy, which continues into the first taste. The flavor is crisp and just a little thin, composed mainly by faintly spicy hops and underlined by some yeastiness. The feel of this beer is very thin, which I expected from a lager. The thin texture fits well with the amount of carbonation present. Overall, for a 12 pack at roughly $14 ($1.16 ea.), this beer is a good daily drinker. I would recommend this to go with fatty or fried foods such as burgers, pizzas, or nachos.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 While not necessarily perfect (or even my go-to when given a choice), Sam Adams is probably my favorite of the "mass produced" American beers. Also, I recognize that the introduction of this line inspired a nation of American beer drinkers to ask themselves "Wait... why DO we tolerate bland beer in this country?!" People who are trying to get into craft beers will undoubtedly seek out Sam Adams the same way someone seeks out Metallica before listening to other forms of heavy metal and you know what? That's perfectly cool if it leads them to bigger, better things.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 4.25 Really the reason American brewing has come around. Started the craft movement in the States and still the only drinkable mass market American beer.     That sells the beer short. It IMHO stands up as a great beer on its own.

I can't for the life of me understand why this brewery is still around. My only guess is they got a lead with marketing and distributors in the area. Mediocre formulaic restaurants want one craft beer to put next to their Bud, Miller, and Coors taps so they carry Sam Adams.

Overall - I would drink this any afternoon. Basic, cheap, middle of the road road. Blows the socks off of Bud/most macros, but is inferior to basically every micro.

Looks way richer than what you would normally call a lager and its bready smell tells you that it has more on the inside too. Malty semi-sweetness lingers on (two-row summer barley) with European/German hops (Hallertau Mittelfrueh and Tettnang Tettnanger). It suits Boston perfectly, for in New England can they revive the Old World with its classic taste. Recommended for everyone who never had a good lager other than the ABs!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Poured from a 12oz bottle.    Look - golden-amber in color, one finger head with excellent lacing retention. A near perfect look.  Smell - biscuits, malts, brown sugar, and light hoppiness.  Taste - malty flavor initially hits palate first, with a slight bite of bitterness and some hoppiness near the end. very well-balanced.  Feel - light/medium bodied, medium/high carbonation, and low ABV .  Overall - the flagship is still one of their bests. I like all of the seasonal and experimental offerings, but it's always nice to come back to this one. easily drinkable on any occasion.

Surprised I'd never reviewed this until today since I've had it many times. It's a quite enjoyable Vienna Lager. Perhaps not as punchy as the Neshaminy Creek Churchville Lager that typically frequents my fridge, but it hit the spot and it made me consider buying this for home now and again.

Strong malt smell with faint spicy hop aroma. Taste is caramel sweetness with a hint of toast, followed by an assertive, pleasant earthy and spicy hops. A very drinkable beer. Boston Lager is a victim of its own success. If your local brewery made this, you’d think it was the best “drinking beer” in town.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 IDK how I haven't gotten around to rating this yet  L: Looks solid. Have it in one of those Samuel Smith pint glasses you can get in packs at stores, always helps produce a nice head. So this pour gave an incredibly nice, frothy head, spotty lace. Beer is amber/orange in color.  S: Smells malty, sweet. Toast, caramel, toffee, a bit of citrus. Floral hop notes. Inviting  T: Drinks rather dry, drier than it smells. Malts provide a slightly caramelized sugar sweetness though its light. Hops shine more here, provide a vibrant citrus flavor with a light and crisp bitterness throughout the palate.   F: Pretty drinkable/quaffable. Carbonation is high and slightly prickly, beer is smooth and easy to drink. Body is not quite as light as say, a Helles, but still very light nonetheless.   O: Really is a quintessential lager, perfect gateway to craft, but something you can always return to after diving into the rabbit hole and still enjoy. Enough complexity to keep you intrigued, but not too much as to scare off the newcomer. Great beer, definitely a classic.

Can tell just by the smell that it's a more hop forward style of lager. The taste is some of the piney hop notes and then a sort of toasty malt. Not bad.

I haven’t had this in years but found it at Total Wine in 12 pack cans for $11.99! Hell yes! I’ll be keeping this in the fridge more often at that price. Cheers.

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 12oz bottle bb March 2018 poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp 5% ABV 30 IBU. The beer pours bright light honey in color with persistent sticky off white head. The head recedes to a cap with some lacing left behind. The aroma is faint with only a bit of caramel coming through. The taste is fairly nuetral with some faint caramel and honey. The hop taste is earthy and there is an appropriate bitterness in the end. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. Overall, very good.

I can imagine how in 1984, when this beer was released, that Boston Lager would have been revolutionary. While nothing out of the ordinary by today’s standards, today's beer scene owes a lot to the Sam Adams and Sierra Nevadas of the world.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3.75 Good 'ol Sam Adams. As an introduction to craft beer, it delivers splendidly. With the right balance of malt sweetness and hop bitterness to keep you coming back. Though, granted, it doesn't have a ton of bite, and therefore can leave a more mature drinker, even early on, crave a little something more. This beer should not be underestimated, I'll be enjoying the boston lager for a while. Though it's your run of the mill, It ought to be the standard.

I would like to note that the patriotism that comes with drinking this lager is where it is at. oh but it is nice to have one of these if you kinda dont want to have a craft beer but kinda dont want to have a budweiser, beats that pisswater yueling by a long shot.

T: Dry with flavors of caramel and biscuit. Bitterness nicely in balance.  M: Light bodied with solid carbonation. Very crisp finish and refreshing.

The head is white and shows little retention but good lacing.  S: The aroma has standard barley aroma on top of some sweetness I can't actually think where it comes from. It almost smells like corn but it's unlikely on this beer (or is it?).  T: The taste begins with a sweet touch to the beer, mostly to the wort and sugars of the barley and ends with slightly and very minimal roast of barley and a bitterness that is a bit disappointing.  M: Body is medium to low. Carbonation is perfect. Bitterness is minimal and the end of the sip is sweet. Not a fan.  O: I don't usually play ball with lagers, and this Boston Lager from Samuel Adams is something I won't recall as a good beer for me. Acceptable for a lager, not cool for my type of beer.

Clean mouthfeel; almost like drinking a very light carbonated water. Soft body, very refreshing. Although not the best Lager you could probably buy, this is definitely a trailblazer and masthead for the style. You could be doing a lot worse, which is surprising considering the company that it comes from is a bigger brewery. Recommended.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours a beautiful medium amber with little head, smells sweetly of cereal and a little hops, not to the point it's overpowering, a very balanced and light smell  Taste is complex yet light, a good lager taste with hops that are undeniably present   This is an amazing beer that's also immensely drinkable, not my favorite style, but this sh#t is good

Overall, the aroma is light but very present and pleasing.    The beer tastes of barley malt, a hint of caramel, a bit of white bread crust, and hop bitterness at the end.    The beer is light to medium bodied and the finish is smooth and dry.    If you enjoy lagers I would certainly recommend trying this one.

Mouth feel was smooth with a pleasant aftertaste lingering in the back of the throat. Overall good beer. Solidly crafted. Date on the bottle read May 2017. While the Samuel Adams company is based in Boston, Ma this particular batch was from my hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 L - nice amber brown.   S & T - toasted bread maltiness; caramelly sweetness.  F - nice and light, very sessionable.    O - decent for a lager. Quite sweet, though, very caramelly, but quite flavorful for a beer with such a low ABV, to be fair. So if you're into the sweeter/caramelly stuff and don't feel like ordering a heavy-hitter, this one's for you.    I don't particularly recommend this one.

Clean and crisp beer, a little bitterness lingers but not too long. Overall, I think it's a beer that people tend to forget about when it's surrounded by the latest IPA or BA stout, but holds a solid place. It's a tasty beer, light enough for summer, well lagered, and for a 5% beer actually holds a lot more flavor than a number of session IPAs around the same ABV.

Because they brew so much of it and it is found everywhere I think less of it.    But when I truly use my senses, it tastes great! Not much beers like it out there. This is a beer that NEEDS to be drank fresh. It's so much better fresh.    I taste biscuity malts, a hint of citrus zest, and caramel. I also taste metal, which is sharp. The hops are definitely in there, but not as strong as piney hops.

look: 3.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Had this on tap at Applebees, without a doubt the craftiest lager I've had so far.  The look: looks more orange than your typical lager, with a nice foamy finger of head.  You can smell the hops, along with some citrus and some malts, but it's not overpowering, a well balanced aroma  The taste is great, the the hop notes coming through on the front of the tongue, some more citrus, not quite as malty or yeasty as I was expecting.  Has an even feel in terms of mouthfeel and hop character, if you can call it that, very smooth all the way through.  Overall, this has become my top lager to session because of the drinkability and readiness on the palate. Not the best beer I've had, but still really good   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 This is an excellent American take on a Vienna lager. Nice clear, and bubbling amber appearance with typical short lasting white head that leaves a nice shadow-head after it settles out. Smells malty and bready. Taste is remarkable. Sam Adams is on the money with a great balance of sweet and bitter, with just enough hops to completely the subtlety sweet malt flavor. Finishes crisp and thirst quenching. Light-medium bodied and a great American beer.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 From notes taken 03/14/17:    Nice mostly clear amber or butterscotch, but quite cuprescent. Fluffy, rocky, light, but well-structured and immovable head, creamy tan in color with good retention an abundant, delicate lacing. Sweet and malty and grainy nose, with caramel and honey but also a hint of dark fruit. Palate is grain and caramel as expected but more bitter than aroma lets on, although that is not uncommon in lagers. Hops are floral to grassy but stronger and more soapy and peppery than I prefer in a lager. Still, this is a classic and quite drinkable, due to the balance. Lighter body, somewhat sparse but fairly sharp carbonation, yet ending on a softer effervescent note.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 The granddaddy of craft beer. Clear light amber color. Biscuity dry smell. Thin dissapating head. Decent lacing. Has a malty, caramel, lemony, biscuit flavor with a nice light hop balance. Every place that sells or serves beer should at least offer this. But unfortunately, they don't. They are too busy selling Bud Light to know a decent beer.

look: 3.25 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3 A pseudo craft beer. Not bad and somewhat enjoyable, but watered down in order to appeal to the masses.    Look: Pours a clear orange yellow color with a one finger off white head of foam. Leaves a tiny bit of lacing.    Smell: Very faint, almost no nose. Mild caramel with a toasted bread note.    Taste: Rather sweet throughout. Lots of sugary malt upfront with a slight caramel taste. Notes of honey and apples. Mild toffee. Very sweet with a lingering taste of caramel.    Feel: Body is light with moderate carbonation. Sweet and sugary, somewhat thirst quenching, but very saccharine.    Overall: I can't tell if this beer is old or fresh because Sam Adams uses a ""Best Before"" dating system instead of a proper bottled on date.     I hate ""Best before"" codes - they're useless as far as I'm concerned - because there's no way of telling when the beer was actually bottled. They could be giving this a six month shelf life for all we know, which is not """"""Fresh"""""" for a beer, especially a lager.    Let me decide when the beer is ""Best Before"" by providing me a bottled on date. This is simply a cop out in my opinion and a half assed way to both sell more beer and provide the bare minimum amount of information to the consumer. Sam Adams is having their cake and eating it too, paying the customer lip service but not actually providing any meaningful information to the drinker.     Was this beer bottled three months ago? Four? Six? Eight? There's no way of knowing.    I'd love to know if this is fresh, the date says it's within two months of it's ""Best Before"" date - but it's very sweet and malt heavy - like an old beer...    Theres no way of knowing if the beer is actually intended to taste like this or if my bottle is just past it's prime.    Overall this is good, but it could be so much better. It's thirst quenching with a good mouthfeel and moderately dry aftertaste - but very sweet throughout without much influence from the hops. I will admit I enjoy the taste, but if they just dialed back on the malt a little and added a tiny bit more hops, this could be exceptional.

Thin,frothy,white head with moderate retention and lacing.Light copper colored body,with a slight amber hue.Very nice clarity,with light carbonation.    On the nose I get sweet malt notes backed by some spicy hop characteristics.    The palate follows the nose with sweet malts up front,and spicy hops on the back end.    The body has a medium / light mouth feel,with moderate oxidation on the tongue,and a slightly dry,yet smooth finish.    This is another solid beer from Sam Adams,nothing out of this world,but a good beer.I've had it many times before this review,and will probably drink it many times after.

My new favorite everyday drinker (and I'm usually into Stouts) BL is every bit as good as any micro/'craft' brew - but it's available everywhere, it's consistent, and it's supermarket priced. What more do you want? We live in a wine-making area, and in the past 10 yrs or so we've had an influx craft distilleries, meaderies, hard cider producers, and most recently- an onslaught of "craft brewers". Now this is all great stuff for the local tourist economy, but unfortunately most of the beers being produced are, in a word, awful. Lots of Uber-trendy hop-bombs... joined by the crazy "dump every dried spice/flower/fruit/nut/herb under the sun in the brew" - make crazy labels, and sell it as 'hand-crafted' for $4/bottle at Wegman's. Boston Lager is the remedy for all of that nonsense. It's truly a premium product being sold at the same price point as Genny, Bud, and Miller - but it's so much more complex and as so many others have already stated - balanced. I love the amber color, the just-right bitterness and lingering malty/yeasty-sweet finish... at first flavor hits you with some aromatics (don't really know what's in there - sorry I should have researched this a little better) but is very satisfying without being over-the-top in any one area. My only sub-4 score would be the nose... not even a complaint, more of a statement since all of this is 100% subjective but to me the nose doesn't accurately reflect that first sip. Honestly - forget the 4-stars, I'd give it 5 stars but that has to be reserved for those once-in-a-great-while jaw-droppers. PS - it is quite "Ale-ey" if you taste out of the bottle but don't look at it... it is crystal clear like a good lager but does have ale qualities. Maybe rename Boston LagerAle? LOL

L - Pours a penny-copper red with a thick three fingers of off-white head that leaves a light lacing throughout.     S - Sweet caramel, bready malt, a touch of piney hops.    T - Like the smell, a balance of bitter and sweet with some spice from the hops. The sticky caramel flavor gives way to some bitter, spicy hops but is very balanced. Not strong in either direction.    F - Light to medium bodied, good amount of carbonation with a soft, dry finish. Very drinkable and balanced.     O - This is a beer that prides itself on balance. It's definitely a good run-of-the-mill beer if you want something with a little more "oomph" than a Bud Light, but doesn't sit as heavy as a stout or IPA.

look: 3 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 Years ago I considered this a hoppy beer and I usually chose something else. Then as my hop tolerance rose I started to enjoy it and think of it as something special. Through the IPA years I thought it was awful and could not drink it. Now that I am back to a broad spectrum of beer I tried it again and it seemed like just a decent everyday beer. Clean, some taste but nothing to write home about. I really believe a Yuengling IPL is better. Brooklyn lager for sure is a better choice.

look: 3.5 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Pours a yellow orange with rich foamy head and the lacing is decent. Smells of sweet malt/syrup, mild hops and some spice. The taste is pretty good, I get a malty hops up front with a spicy finish and maybe just a little citrus. This is a fantastic mainstream beer and is what I consider a staple beer to choose over some others. I really enjoy this beer ice cold and have to say a well made beer.

Balanced flavor profile with a warm center makes it a good easily-available choice for the winter months.

T: Waves of flavor wash over the tongue. the grains with just a bit of sweetness in the middle that is pushed back buy a considerable wave of herbal almost pine like hop that fades to a lingering dry finish. Easy to see why its a classic.  O: I haven't had one in a year or two and still it is a solid full flavor beer. Not my fave but a very respectable offering. The balance and layers of flavors are what will bring me back.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 This is a pretty good beer with a strong hops and wheat taste. It has a medium acidity level and is full-bodied. It is the first beer I was ever able to fully drink and say that I somewhat enjoyed (ca. mid-September 2016).

look: 3.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3 Poured it in a mug. Let's gulp it down! Haven't had one of these in a minute. Brew's dark amber in color, with an inch of off-white head. Some lively carbonation. Fairly clear as far as I can tell.    Aroma is mostly of toasty-grainy malt, with some herbal and spicy hop notes floating around as well.    Clean lager profile. Toasty malt and herbal hops in balance. Decent-sized bitterness, mostly on the end.     Medium body. Somewhat crisp with a softer finish that helps leave a nice malty-sweet aftertaste to accompany that tongue-tapping bitterness. A nice one to glug.

I don't need to feel like I'm being punched in the face with hops and floral / citrus / pine or whatever else notes every time I drink a beer.    And for all those people saying this beer isn't hoppy or is too light, SA Boston Lager has 31 IBU's. The point at which the human palette can no longer detect any flavor difference is around 38-40 IBUs.

It wasn't my normal style preference as I tend to go for IPAs, porters & stouts, but this was a good beer nonetheless. It had no real hop flavour to speak of but had a nice full malty flavour with full smooth mouthfeel and no off/adjunct flavour even though I enjoyed it on a warm summer day a few degrees above fridge temperature. The bready flavours which came out as it warmed were not complex at all but were pleasant all the same.

Hoppy, but mild, and slightly bitter taste that continues into a aftertaste, with a nice finish. It is a good beer, canned or bottled. Drink up!

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 I had heard so much about Sam Adams that sampling it was essential. This lager had a definite rich hops flavor; however, it was to be expected based on the TV marketing of the beer. It is my understanding that the hops give lagers a sweet taste and this one is no different. The look was very crisp and orange with surprising lacing with respectable amount of foam. As I drank the bottle, never did I feel like it lost its flavor or its crispness. I will say that the overpowering sweet flavor, I can see how somebody would not prefer it, but it did not seem too much for me. A good Friday night kick back kind of beer for me.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This classic lager pours a bright clear amber color with   a moderate head of white foam that subsides to a thick ring, thin pool, and light lacing.  Nose of caramel malts, light breaded malts, spicy hops, and light herbal hop notes. Flavors  exceed the nose with caramel malts and light breaded malt notes on the front and sides, subtle  herbal notes hit nicely on the middle and fade into a floral hop note that is perfect for this classic  brew. Nice mouth feel, medium carbonation, and a lightly herbal bitter hop note on the aftertaste.    I still taste the flavors I remember, but the look has changed a touch with the now faster dissipating  head, and while this is not a problem I remember distinctly putting the cap atop the foam to many  peoples surprise and then taking a drink and it was still there. I have many fond memories of getting  this brew and cherishing it back when it was a rarity to find in the Cincy area prior to them brewing  it here. That said, the flavors are still present and I am reminded of how much I appreciated it on the  brew landscape when the best you could get was Sam Smith and Lowenbrau.    Cheers SA, keep up the good work....and PLEASE bring back the foam!

It's not, it's a mass market corporate schill. Still it's alright, if you like light beers. Slightly more spicy and warm than mass lager piss water, but still not good. I appreciate that they are a gateway to better beer for newbies, but don't stop here. In a few years you will learn that this ain't really very good.

Pleasant smell but not very powerful.    T: Initially a little bit of bite. From the carbonation maybe? Not sure. Like I said I'm a little new at this. Slight hoppy notes, but not overpowering. A bit of caramel in the finish.    F: A little bit of carbonation and bite at the beginning and then a pretty smooth mouthfeel.    O: Nothing bold and exciting about this beer, but nothing terrible about it either. Pretty good neutral flavored beer that most beer drinkers should be able to enjoy.

This is a gateway beer for a lot of people who make the jump from Bud or Coors into craft beers - it's an impressive beer on its own. Full hops sweet not bitter rich not heavy. Pretty easy to drink 3 or 4 of these.

In actuality, the nose is very subdued, almost non-existent.    Sharp flavor--almost spicy--with crackers, bread, and corn.    Crisp finish.    For how proud Jim Koch is of this beer, it's only a small step up from the big AALs, and not something I'd revisit intentionally, given the current state of nearly unlimited options.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 It’s the original Sam Adams beer that started it all, not just for Sam Adams, but arguably for the craft beer craze in America in general. This lager pours a color somewhere between golden and russet with a fairly large white creamy head and a pretty high amount of carbonation. It leaves a nice lacing. The smell is almost nonexistent, but is faintly of malt and a little bit of citrus. The flavor has some bready, slightly caramel, malt character with some hops that come peeking out at the end and a little citrus coming out with it. There is a little bit of an earthy taste to it also. It’s a pretty well balanced beer, but not too exciting. The body is medium, but must have looked heavy compared to all those mass produced beers when this first came out. The finish is crisp. Over all I would say this is fairly average, or maybe a little bit above as far as Sam Adams beers go, but it’s a long shot better than most other mass produced American beers.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Boston Lager pours with a short but dense, white head. The body is clear and dark golden in appearance. The aroma is full of floral, spicy hops. This continues into the first taste. It has a malty sweetness that finishes with a nice hoppy bite. The bitterness and carbonation lingers leaving a refreshing feeling.

Taste has a nice malt toast caramel impression, somewhere along the lines of an Oktoberfest or Marzen. Minimal levels of hops, bitterness and body.     I can see why this blew up and got big. It does have more substance and flavor than most mass produced lagers. Its smooth. They didn't skimp when making a beer with some specialty malts instead of using loads of corn and 6 row barley. Old world hops.

The hop profile seems nice at times to the nose, but comes out tasting bland with almost every sip. The balance of malt to hops is nice, unfortunately neither the malt or hops selection seems innovative or even good tasting.

I'm a big fan of Vienna style, amber lagers, and this is one of the better ones out there. This review is of a 12 oz. bottle from my fridge.    L- Golden amber color, over a finger of off-white creamy head. Nice lacing on tulip style beer glass.  S- Caramel, malt, roasted nut, hops. Very fulfilling amber lager smell.  T- Very hop forward for this style. Caramel malt flavor, roasted bitterness. Finishes very nice and refreshing.  F- Full mouth feel, heavy style lager. You definitely know your drinking a full bodied beer.  O- I'm a little biased towards this beer, I do buy it often. If I had any negatives about it, it would be that it's heavy, maybe too bitter sometimes. If you love light beers or adjunct lagers, you will probably hate this. This maybe a little too much for someone new to beer to start out on, but it should be tried by everyone at least once. Very nice beer! Highly recommended!

Taste: Solid. Rich malt cake with hop icing. Consistent flavor all the way through, finishing clean and crisp with lingering malt touches. What other Viennas aspire to be.    Texture: Medium leaning towards full.     Overall: A very well crafted (yeah, that's what I said) beer in the Vienna style. I say that like I really know what I'm talking about, every Vienna I've had tasted different, but the style brings to mind caramel malty richness with balancing hops and that describes this beer pretty well.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Not too bad for a beer stuck in limbo between craft and macro. Certainly much better than macro AAL such as Bud or Miller as it is sweeter and less dry. I wonder if the recipe has varied or if my taste has, but the first time I tried this I liked it more than the last time I did, where it seemed a bit more bitter and less grainy.

MUCH BETTER on draft, this is a beer I'd order at a bar if there really isn't much to choose from.    The look is gorgeous lets be real. It looks so good and mouth watering.    Some sense of hops, malty and some caramel notes in the taste. It can be filling but it's the perfect beer to go with wings.    Cheers!   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a nice amber color well into a pint glass. Smells of slightly spicy hops with a strong malt presence - a solid balance between malt and hops in my opinion. A rich, smooth, medium body with consistent flavor throughout the experience. I've been a fan of this classic for a while.   
look: 1 | smell: 2 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 | overall: 5 Poured from a dented can into an empty water bottle. Beer was all head and needed 5 ice cubes to chill it down (3 is my max...5 is preposterous). Aroma is very turnip forward (as in a lot of Sam Adams beers) and reminds me of blueberry chill and fun in Hawaii. Taste is that of Vienna, which is quite smoky...orange, minty and slightly of moth balls. Mouthfeel was of a fine aged custard. Overall this is a great beer designed in Boston and maid in Vienna.     *The dented can looked at me very judgemental.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.25 Reviewed in Roger Protz' " 300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"  On the "1001" list, this probably deserves to be on the list for its role in bringing a tasty alternative to the largest number of American palates early in the craft movement. In fact, it could be argued that Sam Adams was among the first, and probably is still the best, at marketing. Boston Lager was first brewed in 1984.  More malty than hoppy (tho still balanced), this beer goes well with a variety foods, particularly summer salads.    5/17/17 tasting notes: Often my go-to in restaurants with minimal craft selections, I am appreciating two things more: first, that this malty lager goes well with normal palate foods; second, that Sam Adams is fortunate to have a cash cow that actually serves a purpose other than to fund all its experiments.

Smells of barley, malts and a yeasty odor as well. Damn! Smells like a beer!    The taste is like some lightly roasted malts with a touch of caramel. The hops are hiding pretty well in here and can be found somewhere towards the back of the taste.    Mouth feel borders on that medium side but finishes fairly dry cleansing the palate for the next swallow.    I like this beer! Some Vienna Lagers can go overboard with the caramel and sweet notes. That I do not like and I do not find that in this beer. Out of a bottle this beer is pretty darn good. However this beer gets better when you go out and have a cold one on tap. And there supposedly are no adjuncts in this one so that alone does make this that little bit more special.

Regardless of what I finish the night with, I always start with a Boston lager. Balanced and smooth, but with a kick. At first sip, the hops are evident but not overpowering; a touch of sweetness in the middle gives way to a crisp, dry finish. Excellent paired with many different foods; my favorites are pulled pork, fajitas and of course, pizza. This beer deserves all of the accolades it has received. A true classic.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Rated for the style:  APPEARANCE: A clear caramel colored beer with an ample amount of tiny bubbles rising. About 2 fingers of off white creamy/foamy had that lingers a good while and leaves a tremendous lacing down the glass.   AROMA: Big caramel toast/biscuit. Grassy, spicy, and a slight floral note.  TASTE: Toasty, caramel, a little earthy and spicy. Very good balance between sweet and bitter.  FEEL: Nice full level of carbonation, Medium thin body. A fairly dry beer all the way through the sip.  OVERALL: Just a real pleasant beer. Very nicely balanced between sweetness and a mild bitter quality. Great everyday beer.

Taste signifies grain, bready ] + slightly roasted golden wheat. Mild hops comes in to play most at the end.     Smooth mouth.    The general consensus is pretty on point with this. It has real flavor, and is very refreshing. Almost the platonic absolute of beer.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Poured 12oz bottle into snifter glass. 4.9% abv    Appearance- Pours a copper orange with large white head. Very clear.    Smell- Cooked grain, baked bread. Light hints of caramel.    Taste- Grainy malt base, bready flavor. Sweet grains, some very slight roasted notes. Caramel sweetness builds midway in the flavor profile. Hop bitterness rounds out only in the finished, minimal yet worthy of a higher note only since this is a lager.     Mouthfeel- Thin to medium in body with active carbonation.     Overall- An easy going lager with good smoothness and use of malt. Worth picking up on draft should the choices not be mond blowing. A reliable offering, yet not explosive. Good showcase beer nonetheless for the Vienna lager style   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Pours an auburn, amber brown, with red hues. Off white head. It looks really nice and enticing. Some toffee and caramel on the nose. Some malt and some skunky hop. The malt backbone on this Vienna is great, but the grassy bitterness is off putting and hurts the palatability of this beer. It has some awesome sweet caramel and toffee notes but that is undone by the hop character. It is weighty and hearthy. This is one of the beers I drank before I got into craft beer, but it's rare that I order this. When I do, I tend to regret it due to the bar's care of its line. When served unadulterated, this is actually a really good lager.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Served in a shaker, it pours a dark amber color with very nice clarity. It develops a nice one-finger head, frothy, that dissipates quickly.     Assertive bouquet. Bready, biscuity, malty sweetness, and just a tad of herbal notes after swirling.    Yes, it is full-flavored, as stated. It follows the nose very accurately, with the addition of the hoppy bitterness to balance out the strong malt presence, very good balance. It is highly carbonated but it feels right in this particular beer. Long finish, medium body and smooth. I must add the fact that my bottle has a best before date of November 2016.     I agree with the consensus, this falls into the "very good", if not "outstanding", category.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 This beer pours a straw color with a small head and good lacing. The aroma offers up a somewhat rich whole-wheat smell, with complementary notes of cedar and toffee. The flavor is a somewhat crisp whole wheat toast flavor, with touch of toffee, vanilla, and very mild smoke. The mouthfeel is crips and refreshing. Overall this is a classic standard, and it does not disappoint. It goes great with food. Am I going to go for this often? Unlikely.

The taste is incredibly malty, with a little bit of hop bite to even it out. Very drinkable, yet heavy and substantial enough to feel like you're not drinking some light beer. Overall I'd say this is a respectable and quality beer. A very run of the mill, any situation kind of beer. I'd compare it with something like Yuengling; it's a standby rather than something truly special.

Feels: Amazing, very refreshing, goes down really easy.    So overall would I recommend it ? For sure, this is definitely a transition beer from those budweiser coors light, bud light to the Micro beer.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Bottle #4 from the six-pack; best-by date is April 2016.    Nice dark-golden color, bordering on orange; very clear, with a lot of rising bubbles. Foam on top is a thin but fairly dense layer with a nice bubbly texture, thicker around the edges; after a couple minutes it starts to fade away in patches but the outer ring hangs around a good bit longer.    Smell is pretty nice as well; a good bit of malt and also some spicyish hops in there. Sometimes on previous bottles I picked up a bit of a fruitier hop presence in the smell too, but am not really getting that one today.    Getting more malt than hops in the flavor today -- a bit of sweetness, some crackery/toasty type flavor, and a bit of something else I can't quite think of words to describe. Also those same spicy Germanish hops present in the smell, with just a hint of bitterness on the end and a slight crackery-malt/dried-grassy sort of thing lingering for a bit after. That slight bit of bitter-fruity hop flavor pops in occasionally too, despite the fact that I wasn't really getting the corresponding smell in this particular bottle. Actually, I'd almost say grassy rather than fruity, but more like fresh grass than dried like the "grassy" smell/taste I usually get in beers. For such a seemingly basic beer that you can get literally everywhere, there's a lot going on here if you pay attention.    Feel is pretty nice -- very drinkable, but not as light and fizzy as a lot of other lagers in the same ABV range; carbonation is definitely present but never too prickly, just a bit of a fizziness to it. Seems a bit stickier and more substantial than, say, a pilsner, while at the same time not going so far into "big beer" territory. Just all-around pleasant to drink.    Overall, this is a really good beer, especially when drank fresh enough that the hops stand out a bit more (the malt is very nice too, but the malt/hop balance is pretty much what defines this beer so without the hops it's definitely missing something.)

Aroma is malty, toasted bread, with hints of grain, lager yeast & grassy hops. Taste is similar to nose but sweeter with notes of caramel throughout & a fine peppery finish. Clean & crisp, peppery, lightly bitter & dry in the finish & aftertaste.

S: Floral and a little spiciness from the hops, caramel sweetness  T: Follows the smell for the most part. Floral/spicy hops provide an excellent balance to a caramel malt sweetness. Has a bready/doughy finish.  F: Light to light-medium body, carbonation is lively but not overdone.  O: A very well balanced lager, that may as well be considered a classic now. I've noticed that I much prefer to let this beer warm a bit, as it allows the malt sweetness to open up more, balancing the brew. I found when very cold, this beer can be a little overly floral and bitter.
