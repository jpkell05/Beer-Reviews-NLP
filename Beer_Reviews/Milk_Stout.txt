look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.5 Had this at a Cajun/creole restaurant in Roswell, GA. It was poured from a bottle into a shaker, both of which were very, very cold…..at least 35°F. Super-dark brown, but not what I’d call black.  I think the over-chilling significantly affected the head (super-thin) and subdued the aroma. Aroma was mostly coffee and mild chocolate, with a touch of roasted malt.  There was more coffee and roast in the taste than chocolate. Minimal hops in the taste.  Mouthfeel was another casualty of the temperature….it seemed almost flat. However, the bittering provided a decent back-bite that was surprisingly effective at clearing the palate for another spoonful of super-sweet bread pudding.  I’d have this again and make sure it’s a little warmer. The beer I received suffered from being served too cold.

Half a finger of creamy tan head sticks around. Each sip leaves behind a widely dispersed pattern of lacing.  Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and a touch of vanilla.  Taste of roasted malt, coffee, and dark chocolate. Provides a little sting to the tongue but no bitterness.  Medium to full, smooth mouth feel. Okay carbonation.  Very tasty milk stout that brings a smoothness and avoids any sour bitterness.

The beer pours dense very dark brown with light brown head. The head is minimal and recedes to a film quickly. There is hardly any lacing. The aroma is a mix of roast malt and semisweet chocolate. The taste is mostly semisweet chocolate up front with a roasty bitterness showing up promptly to lend balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lowly carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. The lactose adds a touch of sweetness that keeps it from being totally dry. Overall, good. This is a pleasant enough example of an unadorned milk stout.

Pours a black walnut color, opaque with a bubbly tan head.    Smell is a dark roasted coffee aroma.    Taste is dark and sweet. Burned sugar, charcoal and licorice.     Mothfeel had a lot of body, with a cloying sugary nature.    Overall a nice stout. Not the creamy feel I was expecting from a milk stout. But it's good.

Aroma/flavor are smooth and malty, none of the extraneous "other" adjuncts/additives. It's an excellent Stout in a world that keeps trying to "improve" a classic beer style by additions to attract attention but fall flat by forgetting to taste like their core identity.    I love this beer. Just don't let SMOS find out...

Pours a decent head with very uniform lace. The nose is strong with dark chocolate and toasted malt. The taste is sweeter for a stout, as was the purpose in this particular brew. The mouth feel, off the nitro, was excstacy. To.my surprise, the finish had a tinge of biterness to it and a small drying effect. Not what I was consider, very hoppy, but a bite more than is usual for a stout, let alone a sweet stout. Overall, It was superb. You'll catch me ordering this any time! Pairs great with sausage and bratwurst and any baked goods containing chocolate or caramel!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 From notes taken 05/05/17:    Not the Nitro Version! I still need to review that one.    Dark reddish brown, so dark it seems opaque in all but the most direct light. It has a brownish tan head of fine-bubbled, creamy foam. Great retention and crooked bands of lace still attached in places to the head. Pleasantly smoky aroma, like cigars or even pipes, with metallic, roasty, faint cocoa and cinnamon, and almost meaty suggestions beyond that, definitely not as sweet as expected. Palate is definitely pipe smoke, it’s strong with wood smoke, tobacco smoke, dark roast coffee, soil, toffee, with faintest hints of dark fruit and cocoa. Nice smoky and soily retro-olfaction. A perfect bitter-sweetness (but also semi-tart and almost metallic), but not so much from any hops that might be in this, serving mostly to balance. Body is lighter, especially for a stout, but I’d still call it medium. Even though this isn’t the nitro version, carbonation is very fine and active, achieving a much sought-after velvety texture. I haven’t had many in this style, but suffice it to say, I really enjoyed this take on it, more than I would your average English, American, Irish, or Oatmeal Stout, even. Can’t wait to try the Nitro version! The only other one of this style I have had so far was much fancier and much boozier but had too much going on, at least compared to this (I still very much enjoyed it about as much, but for other reasons). Licorice notes, for example, are really only good in moderation if you are someone who has never really enjoyed that flavor by itself. This doesn’t have them at all. Hops, then. If this had any more or any crazier hops in it, it would detract from everything else. That’s why this is slightly better to my palate than a number of the otherwise amazing West-Coast takes on the American Stout. Subdued hops that taste like soil and tobacco are the way to go. Pine or leather are too much for something already so robust and gritty. If you’re going to go that far you might as well brew a Cascadian Black Ale, heavy on the citrus and the molasses notes.

"Left Hand Milk Stout"  12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle  $2 @ Weis, Conshohocken, PA    Notes via stream of consciousness: It's been a long time since I've had a Left Hand Milk Stout as I usually come across the nitro version these days. And there was a time once, long ago, that I thought the nitro version was better but I've changed my mind and now I think I like the original better. It's an opaque brown-black in color beneath a creamy head of dark tan. It's not that carbonated so the head falls rather easily but it does leave some nice lacing behind. The aroma is clean and fresh, and like dark bittersweet chocolate with some coffee like roastiness. The flavor follows with some added sweet-apple-like fruitiness, dark caramel, and nuttiness. In the mouth it's medium bodied and velvety smooth once the initial caress of carbonation has passed. It's moderately bitter, but roasty, and although there's some residual sweetish malt it doesn't finish sweeter than semi-dry with lingering notes of chocolate and creamy coffee. It's very nicely balanced and rounded, and as far as milk stouts go it's right on for style.

It's okay, I guess, but nothing to write home about.

Smells of typical roasted malts with a touch of chocolate, and the taste is similar with a bit of sweetness. Mouthfeel is absolutely incredible. This is the silkiest, smoothest stout I've ever had, yet it doesn't coat my mouth unpleasantly. Overall, a great feeling beer without a stellar taste to back it up. Still, definitely worth my time.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured hard from a bottle into a glass.     The nitro is the star with its cascading micro bubbles. Very dark black. Thick coolwhippy head. Sticks everywhere. The nose is roasty, sweet, and creamy with coffee and dark chocolate aromas. Taste follows. The mouthfeel is crazy smooth and creamy, mostly from the dence pillow of cream on top that slips in each sip. But aside from the creamy head, the actual brew itself is a little lighter than I expected it to be. Sometimes borderline thin for a sweet stout. Great nonetheless. Never too sweet. Very drinkable.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 The appearance was a dark black color. Thin white foamy head that’s fairly level and lasts for a good minute. The smell had some dark roast coffee backed up by a decent amount chocolate malts. The taste was a roasty sweetness all the way through, slight roast chocolate aftertaste with a super dry finish. On the palate, it sits about a medium on the body with not much of a sessionable aspect to it. Carbonation is good for the style and for me. Really smooth and creamy. Overall, I say this is good milk/sweet stout that I would have again.

Pretty much on par with the nitro version but the nitro looks better and feels slightly better.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.75 Backlog from 2009. 12 oz bottle. When I had this at the brewery a couple years ago, I was completely blown away. I thought it was one of the best stouts ever. Now, in the bottle, it’s merely great rather than extraordinary. Aroma is quite spicy. Tastes like a very good stout.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 A: Pours pitch black with brown when held to light, clean, and with a small tan slightly creamy looking head that doesn't leave much behind. Minimal lace.    A: Bitter chocolate, burnt toast, and a little bit of iron/metallic aroma.    T: Again with bitter chocolate, maybe some milk chocolate due to a hint if sweetness, but mostly roasted grain/toasted bread. Less iron presence than anticipated.    F: Not as creamy as I was expecting or hoping for. Still smooth with some coating, but medium carbonation, pretty well balanced and a dry finish.    O: Very rarely do I want more sweetness, but I think this one lacked in that area along with a creamier feel. Still a pretty good stout, but not the "Milk Stout" I was expecting. Cheers!   
look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Look - Pours black with lighter amber highlights, a small cap of tan foam, no lacing.  Aroma - Creamy milk chocolate, toast, soft caramel candies.  Taste - Light on the roasted malt, creamy sweetness, chocolate malt, mineral-like. Finish has a bit of coffee but it is very faint. Sugary aftertaste.  Feel - Medium bodied, a touch watery, smooth carbonation.    Overall - A little thinner than expected but still enjoyable.

Retention is minimal, but there's spotty beige lacing left.    S: Oats, roasted barley, dark and milk chocolates, dark coffee with vanilla cream, caramel, burnt toast.    T: Lots of dark and milk chocolate, along with the bready, grainy oat character. Some roasted and burnt coffee, grain, and toasted flavors, but kept in check by a subtle creamy sweetness of vanilla, almond milk, and caramel. Finishes very well balanced between chocolate and vanilla sweetness, and coffee, cacao, and burnt toast bitterness.    F: Medium-plus bodied; could almost be considered full bodied. Smooth, rich, and creamy. It's like carbonated chocolate milk.    O: The definitive American milk stout? This is delicious stuff. Perfectly balanced chocolate and coffee flavors with subtle vanilla and milky sweetness. Creamy and delicious.

The taste is mostly creamy coffee with chocolate. The mouthfeel is creamy, with good carbonation, the finish is a little dry. Overall, this is delicious. It’s ridiculously easy to drink, dangerously so. I would have no problem keeping this around regularly.

It's a little too thin to consider it creamy, but it's trying. A little spotty lacing down the glass.

The beer is super smooth and extremely drinkable.

S: strong notes of roasted coffee and subtly sweet...smells delicious   T: nice and easy but noticeable bite...delicious malt flavor and slight but perfect bitterness in this creamy milk stout.  F: Very easy beer to drink. Goes down nice and smooth with a small bite. Some think it is a little low on IBU but it is perfect for me for an everyday beer at 25 ibu I believe.   O: This is my go-to stout as it is available year around. I am completely obsessed with it. Would recommend buying to any novice or sweet stout lover. They have a nitro option that has stronger notes of mocha and super super smooth but no bite to it so I prefer the original honestly despite the hype of the nitro. If there was one improvement to make this beer complete it would be a tad bit more body.  *IMPORTANT NOTE*   I 100% believe that the stout glass makes such a difference I have had this beer in a tulip and pint glass and I would have given it a 4.25/5 but with the proper stout glass I gave it a 4.93/5 and I always have a 6er in the fridge of this baby...you can pick up a stout glass online (I couldn't find it in stores for under 50$ out of a set) it is only 9$ from left hand.com or spiegelau makes one that I bought from crate and barrel without the left hand symbol for 10$...it is so worth it. It makes the beer go down much smoother...enhances the smells and flavors and keeps the head the WHOLE beer!

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Poured from a 12oz bottle into pint glass in November 2016. I did not see any brewed on or drink by dates on the bottle.    Appearance: Deep black with thick dark tan head. Beer is thick and not hazy. Head is thicker than average, with some lacing on the glass.     Smell: Aroma filled with sweet malts and coffee, with some hops. Interesting variety and balance.     Taste: There is a very sweet and creamy stout, as expected from a Milk Stout. There is a little bitterness from the hops and some coffee flavor. There is a moderate alcohol bite as well. This was done in a nice combination with the other flavors. There is a nice variety of flavors in the aftertaste too.    Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium alcohol level, which confirms the 6.0% on the bottle.     This is a very smooth and creamy stout. It is an interesting combination of flavors, especially with the coffee, malts, and a little bitterness from the hops.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.    Pours a very dark brown, almost jet black. Large tan head, dissipates slowly.     Nose on this beer was subtle, you can definitely identify the sweetness from the lactose, otherwise its your usual cocoa with coffee notes.    Taste on this was surprisingly sweet upfront with the taste following the nose. The sweetness isn't as overt as I was afraid it might be, but makes for a quite pleasant, easy drinking stout.     Could maybe be a bit fuller bodied, but there is plenty to work like. Finish is coffee and rich malt, surprisingly clean as well.    Overall I think it's a very enjoyable beer, easy to drink and accessible to someone like me who is just beginning to explore stouts. I will be drinking this again.

Smell: Coffee notes, chocolate. Smells pretty good.    Taste: Wasn't impressed with the taste. Pretty disappointing since this got really good reviews. They hype isnt real. Mediocre stout and can't even tell it's a nitro. Coffee notes, dark fruit, hoppy on the finish.     Feel: Not really impressed with the mouth feel either. Slightly lighter than a normal stout but not satisfying like a nitro should be.    Overall: Didn't live up to the hype for me. Probably won't be buying again. There are much better nitro stouts out there. 6.5/10   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours root beer brown with an inch of moderate density tan head & light lacing. The head fades at a medium pace. A hint of burnt chocolate on the nose & continues with the taste as well as sweet coffee & full dark malt. The feel is smooth but a little more watery than I'd like. This is a nice beer, but for reasonably priced sweet stouts, I prefer St Amboise Oatmeal Stout to this one as it has a slightly fuller taste.

Nice ruby highlights can be seen when light passes through the body of the beer, leading to a rich appearance. I was able to get a large, bubbly, caramel colored, head, that slowly fades into a ring on the very edges of the beer. When cold, the lacing is thick and pleasing, but as the beer warms, all lacing disappears.    The nose is fairly strong, hints of vanilla, chocolate, and lots of coffee in the finish. You can detect the sweetness from the lactose at all stages of the scent. The flavors follow the nose closely, with a subtle sweetness present throughout the tasting experience. You start with a vanilla flavor that shifts to more of a coco profile before finishing with a strong coffee presence. During the finish the sweetness of the beer transitions beautifully to a bitter finish that really balances out the beer.    The mouthful was thicker than the pour would lead you to believe, but not so think you felt as if you had to chew the beer. Lightly carbonated, it could have had a bit more, but I prefer a lightly carbonated beer over a heavy carb'ed beer any day. I would put the mouthfeel a step bellow the Nitro version of the beer, but the smell and flavor in this version are by far superior. Great beer, easy to drink, and not to high in AVB makes for a sure fire go too beer in the winter months.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 This is one of the most excellent beginner stouts. It's super easy to drink and has a fantastic look, taste and feel. Those that drink a lot of different stouts may find this a little lacking in character but will still agree that it's very comforting and silky smooth. Personally, I prefer this one to the Nitro version.

This awesome milk stout pours a deep blackish brown with a nice head  of light tan foam that settles to a thin ring, thin layer, and spotty lacing. Nose of   chocolate, roasted coffee, cream, and subtle char notes. Flavors lightly exceed the   nose with cream, coffee, and dark chocolate mingling nicely on all sides and finishing   on the rear with cream and coffee. Solid mouth feel, medium carbonation, full on the  taste, coating, and finishing with a touch of char and bitter malt. Excellent.    Cheers

One of the sweetest milk stouts I have had. It's a good thing I enjoy them. This one is very smooth and sweet. Cream, chocolate, light coffee but not bitter. Just creamy, sweet and smooth. Not heavy, very drinkable. Will get this again in winter for sure.

Taste is way too sweet of lactose, the coffee flavor is nice but unfortunately is largely masked by sweetness. The small amount of hops in here are earthy, leafy, slightly spicy, but hardly noticeable. Drinks surprisingly thin for the style, the thin body is made up for with an excellent smooth finish. Perhaps too plain tasting, and too sweet to warrant high rating.

Smell isn't too strong but smell of coffee with creamer, light chocolate, and roasty malts  Delightfully balanced with coffee like bitterness up front, then the chocolate notes, with malty sweetness saving the day at the end, followed by some leafy hops.  Mouthfeel is definitely creamy, and medium bodied.  Overall, decent, but disappointing on the appearance and taste, not bad by any means, but no better than most of its' competition.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Left Hand Brewing - I have yet to partake of one of their offerings to disappoint, and Milk Stout is no exception.    A beautiful dark stout, it does have a weak head with no staying power and much to do about nothing when it comes to lacing. However, the aroma is almost perfection - distinct hints of chocolate and roasted malts, the same can easily be distinguished when it comes to its taste. The mouthfeel is slightly astringent at first, is certainly carbonated out of the bottle, but it eases back as the brew sits. I think I've had some better ones from LH and but this one is certainly one of the better milk stouts in its class.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 A: Very dark brown color, almost black.   S: Very sweet and chocolate based smell.  T: Tastes somewhat of coffee. Very powerful milk sweetness, it'd be hard to not detect the mil flavors in this one. Not enjoying it as much as I thought, but decent if you want a sweet milk taste.  M: Heavy mouth feel, perhaps a medium bodied feel for this style of beer.  O: Overall, I was underwhelmed. Though, it wasn't bad. I would definitely recommend this to those who want a sweet milk stout.   
look: 4 | smell: 2 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This beer was very dark and creamy looking, the head is thick, brown and foamy. Aromas are of chocolate and coffee. The taste is sweet and malty. The carbonation is light. I enjoyed this beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Personally, I hate stouts. But this one I actually could drink. It's dark brown in appearance, looks creamy and opaque with a brown head.

Overall a pretty good beer that I think most stout lovers will enjoy.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This milk stout had good chocolate flavors to it. Although it wasn't really "milky" it was pretty good in flavor.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 OK. I get it. Milk lactose makes this style sweet; Left Hand makes the style's most popular; and I'm liking it.  The logic is overwhelming: I'm a sweet guy ! (Funny how beer can bring transcendence to situation in which little else makes sense.)    Looking this milk stout in the eye, it has not much to say for itself.  Smelling it says toasted chocolate malts and "I won't surprise you."  Tasting this milk stout says my nose was correct.  Feeling it says I've taken this "-ing" too far... but I like how heavily toasted malt keeps the sweet in check.  My original notes said "have this next time with dessert."   I did so with an assortment of cookies and a bowl of vanilla ice cream. (Proving again my good judgment.)    Listed in the "1001 Beers To Drink Before You Die," Left Hand's rendition deserves to be there because its BA ratings has an insurmountable lead and because it led American brewers to save this British style (essentially lost by the 1920s.)   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Really like this beer because it isn't the average beer  Mocha flavor like a coffee with a slight barley and bitter taste   overall sweet and I would order it out while eating desserts  drank this along side a dark chocolate molten brownie

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Pours a black shade of brown with a one finger, khaki colored head.    An unmistakable sweetness coming from the lactose blankets the entire aroma. Other than that, the nose is typical for a stout, coffee, mild tobacco and dark chocolate with roasted malt. Smells really good.    Flavor follows the nose, predominantly tasting of dark (bitter) chocolate, milk (sweet) chocolate and tobacco-esque dry roasted malt. A slight burnt cream taste on the end.    Mouthfeel is quite silky and airy with medium carbonation. Light to medium body - slightly watery.    Overall: The sweetness can get a little cloying at times, but this is a great beer.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Undated bottle into pint glass. Pours a virtually opaque black with a thin off-white head. Initial impression is, interestingly, kinda flavorless and thin. (In all fairness, I'd just tried a Dieu du Ciel Solstice D'hiver barleywine so perhaps ANYTHING would seem thin and flavorless by comparison. Maybe "subtle" is the proper descriptor.) There are definitely roasted malts and a milky sweet caramel/cocoa undertone. Mouthfeel is medium (I prefer thicker) and carbonation is medium (I prefer less). Finish is very neutral, in keeping with the rest of the experience.   Not bad, but certainly not exceptional. I had this on nitro and that was also underwhelming. Not something I'd seek out.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Dark brown with blackish tone. Nice moderately stiff khaki head that was relatively durable. Nose: sweet and malty above all, but with a thin tingle of something else. Taste: sweet and robust, a chocolate aspect, with some hops, though they made a thin line above the full, round malts. Almost chewy at times. Slick mouthfeel, but recedes to a pleasant mild aftertaste. Very enjoyable. Would rate higher for me if it were more complex, but certainly a worthy sweet stout as is.    Bottle pour to glass, bottle stamped "BEST BY 0?/2?/2016" (I think it was 5/28, but in any case it did not taste old).

Light tan head quick to dissipate.     Smell- Caramel, sweet chocolate.    Taste- Sweet caramel, with a milk sugar smoothness. Chocolate milk flavor in a sense due to the quick shot of cocoa that follows. Light undertones of mocha come in as well. Beer finishes sweet yet crisp with a touch of smokiness and vanilla.    Mouthfeel- Medium in body with active carbonation.    Overall- A pleasant and clean milk stout. Quite smooth and spot on for the style.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 Appearance: Very dark, almost black with a cream colored head. It was not what thought a milk stout would look like. I was anticipating a light colored beer, so the dark color was initially surprising. The label on the bottle was very appealing in itself and got me excited to drink the beer even before pouring it.     Smell: This stout smelled mildly sweet with some obvious notes of vanilla, coffee, and oats. It did smell a little bit smoky and nutty but wasn't as noticeable as the coffee aroma.     Taste: At first sip, there were mostly nutty and coffee notes, which was then followed by a sweet toffee flavor. Less distinct yet still present were some chocolate and vanilla notes. Overall a semi-sweet, malty tasting beer.     Mouthfeel: This beer was thinner than I originally anticipated it to be, but I enjoyed the smoothness of the beer. It did however, leave a strange filminess in your mouth that lingered long after drinking it.     Overall: A fairly average beer. It was appealing to the eyes and smelled delicious, but the taste was disappointing. I was expecting a different flavor altogether. Especially with it being a milk stout, I was anticipating a sweeter, more "milkier," creamy taste. It was an average beer.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass    A - Hard pour produces a 1 finger head that is khaki in color and is creamy in appearance. The head dissipates very slowly. The beer itself is black in color an opaque with light carbonation visible on the very edges of the glass with small bubbles rising moderately quickly towards the surface. 4/5    S - Milk chocolate, lactate, and brown sugar really come out in the aroma and cover up most everything else. There is a bit of cold pressed coffee and herbal hops that comes through along with a bit of dark roasted malt and dark toasted wheat bread. Overall a very roasty aroma with a touch of sweetness. 3.75/5    T - Toffee, caramel, and brown sugar lead things off with a sweet punch that is punctuated by toasted wheat bread and a bit of pumpernickel bread that brings out the malty profile. Cold pressed coffee and milk chocolate both open up in the middle of the tasting along with a bit of lactate. Herbal hops finish things off with just a slight lingering bitterness from the hops and coffee. 4/5    M - Light carbonation burn up front which leads into a medium body with a bit of a syrupy feel. A bit crisp and light at times with an ever so slight drying on the back end that does not linger. 4.25/5    O - Well balanced between sweet, bitter, and earthy with a focus more on roast than toast. Medium to heavy body allows for a multitude of food pairings or drinking on its own. Complex but simple at the same time in terms of flavor and aroma. Enjoyable drinking experience. 4/5

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 Purchased from local grocery store at room temperature. Placed in fridge to chill, removed and let stand on table ten minutes. Single 12 oz. bottle, unfortunately no glass to pour into. Appearance: tough to see due to being in bottle. Looks dark and hardly transparent, cannot see head obviously. Smell: chocolate, slight coffee notes, nutty, maybe a little raisin. Taste: solid taste, represents this class well. Chocolate up front, creamy milky following, dissipates with chocolate on the end. Very light. Mouthfeel: very pleasant, lightly carbonated, lacking in the body imo for a stout. Overall stays true to it's name very creamy and hints of chocolate from start to finish. Have tried better stouts but it is an inexpensive beer that is still enjoyable. A: 4 S: 3.5 T: 3.5 M: 3 O: 3.5.

I like that I can find it most places for about $10 a sixer, I bought this one at the local Publix. I also really like the style and it does a decent job of representing it I just wish some of its qualities were a bit more pronounced.

Aroma hit the roast spots, but they stayed in a supporting role as the lactose did its thing with the chocolate.    Taste and mouthfeel hit their silky stride as chocolate milk notes jump in, darker chocolate jumped in, and the carbonation just let it flow all day. It had one job, and it did it relatively well. Deliver me some chocolate malt notes, a lil sweet, boom done.

Almost no carbonation    Overall: I'm not a big fan of darker beers but this one was very good. I liked the smoothness of the beer and the flavor.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours a very dark black color but still somewhat see-through as it comes out of the bottle. Tan head, 2 fingers. Body is 100% opaque in the tulip.     Aroma of strongly burnt malts, a touch of lactose, and coffee grounds - in that order.     Sequence of Taste : Roast malts > Caramel > Milk Sweetness > Coffee > More Caramel > Burnt grounds of coffee with light hop sting.     The lactose does a good job of softening the blow of the roast coffee and malts, allowing the quieter notes to surface, bringing up the caramel and toffee notes. This fades however as the end comes back with a vengeance of hop sting and burnt coffee.    Feel is medium bodied, spatially carbonated, and dries with roast on the finish.     Overall the LH Milk Stout is something I'd have again although I wouldn't rush to buy it. It's a touch burnt for my preferences, but luckily the lactose makes up for that to soften the profile overall.

Exactly what a milk stout should taste like in my opinion. Also, I prefer this over the nitro version.

Aroma just wasn't there for me. Very difficult to discern much.    The taste was decent, on the sweet side with a smooth finish. Not complex, but not bad.    Overall, this is a good beer to drink from the bottle. For the price it is a very fair stout.

A well crafted all round milk stout. Would be interesting on cask.

look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3.75 (Had both, the normal Milk stout and the Nitro-version, which cannot be reviewed separately.) Poured from 355 mL. Black colored beer, with a light brown frothy head, which is rapidly diminishing. Slightly smooth mouthfeel, texture is a little bit thicker than normal, nearly creamy with a medium body and medium carbonation. Compared to that, the Nitro-version shows a more creamy head (very long lasting) and texture (but not as creamy as expected) and soft carbonation. The milk stout has an aroma of roasted malts (more intensely recognizable than in the Nitro-version), dark chocolate, roasted coffee & slight yeast. Moderate sweet initial taste, light bitter aftertaste. Flavors of coffee and roasted malts, some hints of chocolate. The finish is dominated by coffee flavor and is slightly astringent. The intensity of the flavor and aroma is slightly better in the normal milk stout, whereas the palate is better with the nitrogen added. Overall both very pleasant and enjoyable stouts.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Left Hand Brewing Company - Left Hand Milk Stout. 6% ABV. 12oz bottle poured into stout glass (as recommended). Best by 12/7/15.    Look: Aggressive pour (as recommended) yielded a fair sized eggshell colored head on a very dark brown, almost black body.    Smell: Coffee is the strongest, backed by a toasted oat and smoky aroma. Semi sweet smelling.    Feel: Rich and creamy body, but it seems to have a little too much carbonation, detracts from the smoothness it could have.    Taste: Up front is the toasty oat flavor, and sweet coffee flavor. Not much changes into the back end and aftertaste.    Overall: Been wanting to try this one for a few months now, and finally bought it. It is not as sweet as some other Milk Stouts I've had, but that does not detract from it; this one is more toasty-like. It is reasonably good, however it has too much carbonation for my preference, which detracts a bit from the creamy feel it should have.

This milk stout poured an opaque black with two-finger tan head. Good head retention and decent lacing    Smell: Milk chocolate, caramel, coffee    Taste: The coffee and the milk chocolate are there, but also a metallic tinge... Throws the whole thing off. Aftertaste is coffee    Feel: Much thinner than I would expect, with a dry filminess that stays too long.    Overall... the smell and look held a lot of promise, but the thin body and that metallic tinge take what could have been a great milk stout and make it fairly average.

Very pleasant cocoa scent, coffee is there if a little light. Smells like this might be a great after dinner beer.     Terrible shock as I drink this and find it to be so incredibly pale to the nose. How could a beer smell so awesome and have absolutely NOTHING to back it up with. Just a slight roasted malt mixed in with a stunning watery feel. I seriously feel there's LA tap water in this. BLEH    What a disappointment, seriously. Mouthfeel is an important quality to me and this just rubs me the wrong way. I have a few more, I think I may slip in with a tasting to see what my friends think otherwise this purchase is a total loss for me.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3.25 I typically like my beers on the [room-]warm side, and I fear this one has suffered for it. Did not store it in the fridge, so I don't know if or how that has degraded the flavors. About 90% opaque dark brown color with some topaz tinting, and a tame head. Definite coffee presence with a slight enough burnt smokiness, also a lacing of booziness, coming from I know not where, but is nice. Getting a bit of the milky creaminess, but expected more. Overall, more straightforward than nuanced.    The biggest detractor, though, is the weight and feel, which seems like the spitting image of a porter rather than a stout. Too watery for a stout. Not as great as I'd been hearing. It's just okay even if taken as a porter, but it *is* okay.

Definitely smooth mouthfeel and very nice chocolate and milky notes. Definitely a buy again.

The lactose sweetness kicks in mid-palate and continues through the finish, providing notes of vanilla whipping cream. More coffee and milky sweetness on the finish    M- medium body with moderate-low carbonation leads to a somewhat flat mouthfeel and finish    O- a nice contrast of bold coffee and milky sweetness that remains highly drinkable throughout

L: Small but thick tan head with great retention, and the beer has the opaque, jet-black appearance of molasses.    S: Filled up my kitchen with the inviting aroma of milk chocolate, freshly brewed coffee, and toasted nuts.     T: It's not a complex flavor but it's tasty. The chocolate dominates, with light milk chocolate giving away to rich dark chocolate and even the bitterness of baking cocoa. There are subtle coffee and hazelnut notes on the front end.     F: Silky smooth, light-bodied, and truly as refreshing as a glass of chocolate milk on a hot day. This is easily the main appeal of this beer.     I would never turn down a glass of Milk Stout Nitro ... it has a very likable flavor and amazing texture. That being said, there's nothing about the experience that wows me.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Bomber into a pint glass. Pours a medium brown and settles pretty well black in the glass. Lots of carbonation. 1.5 fingers of vanilla colored foam rest on top; this quickly dissolved down to a thin lacing. Smell is sweet chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, and sugared milk. Somewhat weak in aroma. Medium weight with decent carbonation on the mouthfeel. A tad thin, but overall decent. Sweet roasted malt, light hops, and a good balance of chocolate and milk on the taste. Consistent all the way through, but starts to fade on the back end. Not much left on the taste near the finish, which is a bit watery with a decent amount of carbonation left over. A dry, sweet milky aftertaste is left behind after this one's gone.     Overall, not too bad. Better than the nitro milk stout. A bit too thin, and over-carbonated. Got better as it reached room temperature. Good balance between all the components, and sweet enough to be a true 'sweet' stout. At $4.99 for a bomber, I'd probably buy this again.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Nice black color. Perfect for a stout. Tan head that honestly left me wanting. Thin and didn't last. Smell was thin, malt, chocolate. This one's all about taste. It was smooth, creamy, chocolate but I wouldn't call it sweet. Very nice. First time I tried I remember not liking as much... where was the coffee, the burnt malts, the bitter?? It's not in this stout, and I'm beginning to appreciate this style as an easy drinker. Good one for people who don't like Guinness or similar. Bit of an alcohol bite in the aftertaste. Feel was a little thin, but still smooth and creamy if that makes sense. Guests always choose this one when I offer a variety. will buy again.

I said it with the nitro version and ill say it again here, it really reminds me of Edmund Fitzgerald which is a huge compliment. Its light yet very well balanced between milk chocolate and roasted malt characteristics. Its one of those beers that both Guinness drinkers and craft enthusiasts can thoroughly enjoy. i saw cases of this on sale for $17.99 and had to jump on it. The nitro has a creamier mouthfeel but both taste the same   
look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 Perhaps the six-pack I picked up at Harris Teeter in N.

I could pick up the sweetness from the lactose, which was about the only standout characteristic. Overall, a real let-down.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 It pours black with a dark tan head. The carbonation cause a rich appearance on pour. It has aromas of roasted malts and coffee.

The low abv was a turn off for a stout but the flavot is amazingm my first buy from left hand and it will not be my last. One of the best stouts Ive had. Creamy, delicious, malty, rich and flavorful.

The flavor reminds me of vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup, but without any excess sweetness. Indeed, the sweetness here is restrained. It is really neither dry nor sweet. The full but not thick mouthfeel help with this. This is a really solid beer that I am sorry I have passed up so often.

Unfortunately, I don't have one currently on hand to give a blow by blow account. What I remember, it was very creamy, chocolatey, and I loved the fact that it's 25 IBU. Lots of stouts become so bitter that it overwhelms and distracts from all the subtle flavors, but this is beautiful. It's a little sweet, but in a good way, and not cloying at all.

Pours an opaque, dark brown, almost black body that when held to the light shows a few dark ruby red streaks. A one-finger in height, dense, tan coloured head reduces slowly leaving fine bands of lacing after each sip.     On the nose there are mild aromas of dark roasted malts, coffee, and subtle bittersweet chocolate. The taste is fairly simple following the smell with a light initial sweetness and dark roasted malts upfront, followed by bittersweet chocolate, burnt caramel, and coffee. On the end, slightly bitter cocoa and coffee notes coffee linger on the palate to give an enjoyable finish. In the mouth it feels reasonably smooth and slightly creamy. The medium body and ample carbonation make it light on the palate and easy drinking, but overall it’s a little too thin and watery, lacking in the heft I want from a good stout.    Overall this is a decent beer but the lack of complexity and disappointing body left me a little underwhelmed. It’s good, but not one I would go out of my way to try again.

S: Rich, sweet chocolate; dark grains    T: Pleasant roastiness, with some sweetness and chocolate, balanced by hop bitterness.     M: Medium, with a bit of creaminess    O: A solid and tasty brew. Not the best stout I've ever had, but a good one. Wouldn't mind buying this again.

Really extreme glass lacing with this one: Don't think I recall anything exhibiting as much. Again, not super sweet as in say Mackeson, but very drinkable for those who enjoy this style. Smooth, easy drinking, not at all "fog-inducing," wrt the ABV. Very excited to taste the nitro version in a "head-to-head."

The initial taste is of roasted malts, chocolate, and milk. Hops finish the taste with the roasted malts continuing until the end. A truly amazing beer.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Absolutely superb milk stout by Left Hand. Rich, balanced and creamy with malt and cocoa notes. A very mildly sweet finish. Heavy bodied with some moderate lacing. Virtually no foam which is about my only disappointment. Extremely drinkable.

Tastes sweeter than most stouts, but I kinda wish it wasn't as watery. I feel if it was a tad bit thicker the sweetness would have worked better

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured hard as usually instructed by Left Hand milk stouts to a two finger dark tan head. Color is a deep black with decent lacing. The taste of coffee and malt were through out. The low carbonation and sweet lactose made for a really smooth feel. One of the better milk stouts, but not as good as their Milk Stout - Nitro.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 Much nicer as it warms up. I tried it from the bottle after a long cold ride home. Flavors did not present themselves till it warmed up after pouring into a tulip glass. Pours very dark as it should but with a thin head and light lacing. syrupy but a bit on thin side for the mouth feel with very light carbonation. Strong on sugar and light malt scent and flavor but not enough notes present on the tongue to make it really interesting. A little too sweet for my tastes. Needs a little more complexity to balance it out. Overall an excellent brew to introduce novices who are afraid of the dark. Die hard stout vets may find it wanting a bit. Definitely better as it warms though.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 4.5 Great taste. Well balanced and drinkable. My Dad loved it too.     Little bit sweeter,less burnt flavor than a Guiness. Though it has a creamy taste, it didn't have the creamy head like a Guiness - that kinda bummed me out. Perhaps I should've poured it "harder" into the glass? I'm curious as to the difference with the Nitro version. Anyhow, I will definitely be buying this again.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 The cap says "pour hard" i don't know what that means. There was maybe a quarter inch of creamy foam, and it was dark as expected. The taste was well balanced, but just generally not very intense. They call it "America's Stout" on the label, i guess this is probably as good as it gets as far as making a stout with wide appeal (except guinness on tap) however, i think the idea of a stout that appeals to everyone runs the risk of removing the characteristics that make it stout, and i think this goes a bit too far in that direction.
