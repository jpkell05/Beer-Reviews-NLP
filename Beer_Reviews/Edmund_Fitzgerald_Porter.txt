look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A enjoyable nice rich Porter, complex yet drinkable, kind of an everyday Porter.... Not something you want to have once in a while, far. Far better than that. Planning on making it a standard in my fridge.... Darn good brew from Great Lakes.    Added : after giving him the second try I find the coffee of undertones to be a bit heavy if not in the proper mood.   This isn't a porter that you want to drink in quantity or rush... Its a sipper, with strong chocolate coffee undertones that's to be enjoyed in It's time.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 My first impression of this required me to try it again, as I was not too impressed with it. Yes, it was a good porter. Nice dark brown color, Not as heavy, or as thick as a stout. A lighter malt flavor, with a greater hop presents than I normally like in this style of beer. Almost like a dark IPA. Still, I almost always have a few bottles on hand in my beer fridge As I said : "It's a good porter".     BTW: Read Edward Stonehouse's Book on the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald. It will give you great insight about this ship.

Much respect to the Edmund Fitzgerald crew members that lost their life that fateful day. There is a bottled on date so I know that I am drinking it fresh. This is quite tasty especially on a cold winter night like this one. I'm getting dark chocolate notes, some roasted malts, quite tasty, very smooth, nice lacing on the beer glass. Cheers! A-

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A nice dark brown color with a tan head, it looks the part of a quality porter.  Some coffee and chocolate in the aroma with a hint of something vegetal.  The taste is roasty coffee, with chocolate, an somewhat unusual vegetal flavor, and a little hop bite to go with the dark malt. I’ve long heard the legend of this beer but it caught me a little off guard since it was frequently mentioned with Founders as the best in class, but they are very different in flavor profile, IMO. I enjoyed and appreciated it more the second go round, and can understand why denizens of the Midwest like it so much; it’s a good beer!   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Near black with medium light tan head. There's a fruitiness and a resin, slight pine aroma along with a sort of chocolate, sort of coffee roastiness, and molasses. The resiny, earthy, bitter hoppiness is even stronger in the flavor, and blends quite nicely with the roast. Sweet and smooth with a decent carbonation bite.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 When in Cleveland.... This iconic porter pours a clear cola colour - deep brown trying to be black with 1/2 finger tan to mocha head. Aroma is robust roasty with coffee dominant, almost burnt - a little hint of a slightly metallic smell. Taste follows with robust burnt sugar, coffee bitterness, mild hop presence - balances well. Well carbonated with surprisingly thin yet appropriate mouthfeel. Really good.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 2 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 2.25 Appearance: didn't see it in darkness broken only by a kitchen nightlite. Saw it a while ago and it's dark and pretty.    Aroma: roasty, slightly molasses/sweet but burnt.    Taste: hops, burnt character overbalanced by bitterness. Hoppy aftertaste that lingers unpleasantly. Not a fan of the new and spreading American hops fetish.    Mouthfeel: like a medium-bodied porter beer.    Overall: Too bitter to be fully enjoyable. Promises sweetness in the nose but disappoints hop haters.

Great lacing.    S: Roast and coffee mixed with burned sugars.    T/F: Follows the nose. Roasted grains/malts and sweet burned sugars. Coffee and dark cocoa... Bitter roast and mild hops play nicely with the dark sugars giving a complex and balanced brew. Medium to light bodied... well carbonated. The finish is more bitter roast and sweet sugars.    O: A really nice porter, and easy to see why this is one of Great Lakes flagship beers.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Deffo one of the best 'straight up' porters to be found. This particular style has been corrupted, in my view, with too many variants including coffee beans, vanilla, and other flavorings that just do not belong in a porter. Edmund Fitz is superb all 'round, with a lovely deep-auburn/hazel color, great body and nice moderate head, and absolutely none of the tangy finish that is present in some other examples. Highly recommended.

The beer pours dark brown with ruby highlights and light brown head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is faint baker's chocolate, roasted malt and earthy hops. The taste is roasty malts and firm, earthy (roast driven) bitterness throughout. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and nearly dry in the finish. There is a creaminess to the body that offsets the roasty bitterness, especially as the beer warms. Overall, very good. This is a beautiful unadulterated American porter. I will also add that there is no tangy aspects to this beer which I, personally, do not enjoy.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a dark brown with a khaki head with some spotty lacing. Snot locker gets some roasted malts, coffee and maybe some toffee.

The color is gorgeous dark with a bit of head going to lace. The flavor is, to me, layers of different malts and char, complex but approachable. The mouth feel is quintessential Porter, not thin or stout thick, just the right amount of carbonation. Overall, the beer that, after drinking on multiple occasions, you look forward to the next one.

This one sorta falls into a similar category. I said that these beer averages really just speak to the strength of the Great Lakes brand - especially to Beeradvocate users. This is a solid, solid porter but damn that's a high rating. Tried and true nose and flavor. Leaning towards the lighter side in both areas. Follow suit with the others.

A rough pour yielded a small khaki head; nice lace.     Dark roast coffee bean, fresh earth, burnt caramel & faint cream notes in the nose. Enticing!     Medium mouthfeel.     Cream & dark roast coffee bean flavors up front; hop bite on the finish.     The nose promised porter bliss, but the simplified flavor disappointed & the hop bite mixed in gave this a pickle juice aftertaste. Too bad...

This gives a full 2 finger aromatic beige head that lasts.  The color is opaque black. You can not see through a glass of this beer!  There is plenty of sweet aroma from malt as well as some piney hops.  There is plenty of taste from the roasted malt which is a bitter acid taste which totally belies the sweet aroma!!!!  Very little citrus/pine/bitter coffee at the beginning of the palate that follows through to the end. Flavor is full throughout the palate.  Overall, has full, rich flavors, and aroma, but I would rather have my Ale than a Porter.

Taste: More bitter than the smell would let on. Oaky and acidic with the slightest chocolate aftertaste.    Overall: Another strong contribution from Great Lakes. Porters aren't usually among my favorite styles, but this one is true to the form while remaining remarkably drinkable.

Aroma is toasted, nutted, biscuit, earthy malts. Herbal, and pine hops give it a little hoppy zing, but nothing that tips the scales out of favor of the malts. Flavor profile is smooth notes of toasted, nutted, biscuit, earth, and caramel malts that blend together to form a splendid porter. Hints of herbal and pine hops further deepen the flavor profile. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a crisp, liveliness that rewards every sip. Overall, a lovely porter with a diverse array of malts. The diversity of malts along with a small addition of hops keeps this beer drinking splendidly smooth and well-balanced.     Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.

One finger, light tan and creamy head persists. Some spots of lacing left behind with each sip.  Aroma is dark roasted malts, with a slight char. Dark coffee and dark chocolate add in.   Taste is well balanced with dark roasted malts, dark black coffee, and dark chocolate. Very little bitterness.  Smooth, medium mouth feel. Toward the dry side.  Very well crafted porter.

The head is creamy tan with long retention, eventually dying down into a film that leaves streaky lacing behind.    The aroma is unsweetened dark chocolate and baking cocoa. Some acrid black coffee. Black licorice and star anise. Burnt toast.    The taste is bitter dark chocolate and black coffee upfront. Follows with burnt toast and hints of toffee. Black licorice and star anise work their way in and provide some mild spiciness. Finishes earthy with just a hint of vanilla, and then a surprising bitterness that lingers of burnt grains and black coffee.    The feel is the lighter side of medium, well-carbonated, smooth. Almost watery momentarily, but rounds out by the finish. Slightly sticky.    Overall, a really solid and enjoyable porter. Very well made.

Smells heavily of coffee and roasted malt. Notes of cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa, and cream.    Has a nice "roasty flavor" of barley and coffee beans, supplemented by smoke, dark fruit, licorice, chocolate, and vanilla. Feels excellently smooth and robust on the palette.    It's fantastic.

Without going into too much detail, it's robust yet quaffable, complex (with all of the roasted coffee/chocolate character I crave when in a porter mood, which is often), balanced, and in a nutshell, if you like porters, you'll love this. Any time I see it discounted, I grab some, but it's arguably worth the normal-for-around-here $9-10/six.

This beautiful dark porter is my favorite beer made by Great Lakes Brewing Company, a fine well established brewery. My palate places this beer on the sweeter side of porters. The smooth, sweet malty taste (coffee and chocolate notes) and its 6% ABV makes this beer a smooth drinker all year long.

Taste is a little bitterness, dark chocolate, smoke. Medium body, quick finish with a little bitterness lingering. Very nice, leans towards the bitter side as advertised. Different for a porter and I like it. Would happily have again.

Taste: Follows the smell with the roasted barley leading the way followed by coffee and a hint of chocolate.  Feel: Maybe a little light for a porter, but not by much. Smooth and silky with just the right amount of carbonation.   Overall: This is an excellent example of a porter and it lived up to expectations.

Pours very dark with around a finger head that is a light tan color. Minimal lacing and the head lingers around the glass.    Smell is lovely. Roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, coffee bean, and a hint of cinnamon spice.    Taste is much of the same. The roastiness (is that a word?) of this beer is incredible. Chocolate malt, coffee bean, vanilla, lactose, bitter dark fruit.     The feel is pretty damn good for a low abv porter. It has a fairly full bodied mouthfeel although there is a slight watery feel to it. Not quite as thick and robust as I normally like.    Overall just a perfect example of a porter. I came in with high expectations and they were certainly met.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass    A: Pours a brown, cola color with a toffee colored full, creamy head, some light comes through around the edges created nice lovely ruby edges, great head retention.     A: Roasted, toasted malt aromas, slight coffee notes along with a toasted toffee or burnt caramel aroma, not as aromatic as I was expecting.     T: Coffee, roasted malts, picking up some slight dark fruit notes as well, plums, figs, chocolate, moderate amount of coffee-like bitterness, aftertaste is more dark fruits, coffee, and chocolate.     M: Fairly light compared to other porters I have tasted, it's smooth and drinkable, finish is dry with a light coffee ground mouthfeel.     O: A solid porter, there was some mild hop notes, but it's mostly dark flavors and aromas, it's a little light on the mouthfeel but overall a solid porter that I would drink again.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 L -- Dark brown, mahogany-like notes. Opaque. Very slight off-white head that quickly reduces to a rim on a gentle pour.     S -- Roasted malt, sweet toffee, coffee, bittersweet chocolate.     T -- Coffee, roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, plus an herbal earthiness at the end that makes for a great balance to the roasted notes. The hop balance really takes this beer up a notch.     F -- Medium-to-full, nicely carbonated.     O -- Very good porter. The 6% makes this an easy drinker, something that I'd be happy to sit around and drink multiple of come winter. The balance is superb, mixing between the robust malt characteristics and floral hoppiness.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a dark brown color and an opaque consistency. There was a half inch of foamy, tan-colored head that lasted an average amount of time. So-so lacing.    S: A decent, if a little underwhelming, aroma of malt, chocolate, light hops, and coffee.    T: Tasted of a bit of chocolate (definitely could have used more), a lot of roasted malt, a creamy quality, a hint of coffee (only evident in the finish), a chalky lactose quality, and some hops. Like the aroma, the taste was a little on the muted side, with none of the ingredients really standing out. Not a terrible flavor, but not outstanding.    F: A decent amount of carbonation with a mostly dry finish. Medium-bodied.    O: It's kind of hard to reconcile the high rating of this beer with its actual nature. Could have been better.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours close enough to black that the brown highlights hardly matter. Brief foamy head that left a thin cap floating atop the beer.    On the nose, the first impact is chocolate followed by roasty malt. As it warmed up a little, there was a hint of sweetness.    The taste is very good. Taste leads with malt, but eventually is taken over by a slightly sweet chocolate note that is strong on the chocolate. Right on the finish there is a notable floral presence and a bit of a bitter bite that I assume is amplified some by whatever hops are used. All in all, a clean tasting, well crafted porter.    The feel has a bit of carbonation "sting" to it, but the general feel is smooth and almost creamy. Not too thick on the body - medium at best which is fine for the style. There is a little lingering chalky feel and a residual flavor of chocolate that gets a bit sweeter as it fades.    Overall, this is a very good porter. Whether it is worthy of the hype is debatable in my mind. I can't say I have had better, but I have certainly had at least two equals. Good beer, highly recommended.

Taste is not as big as the nose, but well rounded malt and roasted flavors, a bit of caramel and coffee as well. Mouthfeel is a bit thin in comparison to the smell and taste.

When in Duluth you gotta order the Edmund Fitzgerald, as it was sunk in Lake Superior, and Duluth is a port city. Nice maltiness and goes down smooth. Great beer with a steak or burger.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 This beer pours a dark brown color with a huge, sudsy tan head. There are beautiful ruby highlights when held directly up to the light. Retention is solid and there are wispy webs of lacing all over the glass.    Smell is very one dimensional. Sweet caramelized sugar is at the forefront with a hint of coffee and chocolate deep in the background.    Taste is much more well rounded. Caramelized sugar, coffee and chocolate blend together nicely in the begining and then make way for a hoppy bitter finish. Citrus and pine cut through and balance the sweetness nicely.    Feel is medium, chewey and smooth.    Overall a very good porter. The feel isn't beefy, but definitely not watery either. Will definitely have to grab more of this.

Flavour is a little further along towards burnt than truly roasty, with some bitter coffee and char overshadowing the soft sweeter edges of the aroma.     Body is thin and heavily carbonated.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 "Robust and complex, our Porter is a bittersweet tribute to the legendary freighter's fallen crew--taken too soon when the gales of November came early." Brewed in the style of an American Porter, available in 12 oz. bottled 6 packs and on year round draft.    Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a snifter glass.    (Appearance) Pours a crisp, frothy head of a medium tan consistency over an opaque dark brown body with fine sediment and sunset red highlights. Retention is good and lacing is light and patchy. 4    (Smell) Toasted caramel grain, chocolate malt and earthy toffee form a complex, yet drinkable malt body with a subtle lightness, essential for a porter. Delicate undertones of roast and dark fruit. Very textbook but pleasing aroma with no unexpected additions. Potency is moderate. 4    (Taste) The flavor largely follows the aroma, with a light-drinking malt body of dry chocolate malt, smooth toffee and lightly toasted caramel malt midsection, and a gentle cold roasted malt finish. Very clean, highly drinkable. 4    (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, lightly chewy, medium dry. Carbonation is moderate, generating a medium frothiness and a moderately crisp finish. Body is medium for the style, medium+ overall. Balance is nearly even sweet to roasted and toasted specialty malt character bitterness. Alcohol presence is light and there are no off characters. 3.75    (Overall) Edmund Fitzgerald Porter isn't extraordinary by any means in that it doesn't take any particular risks in pushing the style beyond its current boundaries, but falls rather gracefully in the middle, generating a precise, enjoyable malt body that nicely balances out with the subtle specialty malt character, all while maintaining a high lightness and drinkability, essential for the design of a quality porter. In conclusion, it doesn't reach the pinnacle of some experimental and unique variations on the style, but is a great starting place for what we should come to expect from our American Porters. 4    Great Lakes Brewing Co.'s  Edmund Fitzgerald Porter  3.98/5.00

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.75 Thanks to Superspak for the chance to finally try this guy, from his box in NBS BIF#4, MWK. Best by 12/31/16. 12oz bottle, poured into 10oz goblet. Poured a very dark brown color, just short of black, and had a bit of a reddish tint near the edges. The beer was nicely clear, and had about 1/2 inch of tan head that dissipated at a moderate pace and left low lacing.    Some nicely gentle roast notes were at the front of the olfactory portion of the program, with a gentle underlying malt scent. No noticeable hop profile. The taste was similar, but stronger, with the roast bordering on being coffee-like.    The body was thinner than I prefer in the style, but was smooth and even. There was good carbonation across the tongue, giving a very enjoyable effervescence. The roasted flavors lingered a few moments at the back of the palate, and led to a dry finish.    Drinkability was very good, I can see where folks could, and have, drink a lot of these. Overall, a very nice brew that certainly lives up to its reputation. If it were locally available, It would probably have it in my rotation.

This beer had a really nice look almost seeming black but in light it looked more like cola. The head had an initial rise and subsided quickly leaving just a thin layer on top which helped accentuate the great aroma of coffee and chocolate that this beer releases. As far as taste it matched the smell which I thought was delicious. As for feel I really am not an expert but I thought that it changed from the start toward the finish but it could have been a little too cold to start with and as it came to an appropriate temperature really became pleasant. Overall I really liked this beer and will be drinking it more often.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.5 Look: Great looking beer. Pours nearly black, although holding up to light reveals a surprisingly clear dark brown cola color. I poured this pretty aggressively and ended up with about three fingers of tan head which went down fairly quickly leaving a thin layer to sit on top for the session. A splotchy lacing was left on the glass as I drank.    Smell: Initially, I got a lot of roasted malt, coffee, and just a tiny bit of chocolate. As I drank I noticed that the roasty aroma subsided and it balanced out very well with the chocolate.    Taste: Very similar to the taste. The first two sips or so had overpowering roasted malt and coffee flavors, which I am completely fine with. As I drank, the sweetness of the chocolate emerged a little more to balance out the flavors. There is a slight hop presence in the finish too that isn't overly bitter, and it actually balances the sweetness of the chocolate very well.    Feel: Medium bodied, and slightly creamy. An appropriate amount of gentle carbonation. A slightly dry finish that fits the roasted malt and mildly hoppy taste near the end.    Overall: I really liked this brew. I'm a big fan of porters, and this one stands out as one of the greats.

Deep chocolate aroma and rich breadiness. Toffee sweetness rolls in with every inhalation. Slight touch of earthiness from the hops joins the party, and the beer produces additional aroma after wonderful aroma as it is warming. Very subtle dark fruit and cocoa powder. Outstanding, subtle, and always evolving.    Strong and sharp breadiness transcends the nose. Slightly acidic (in a good way) with a nice hop bitterness and barely perceptible earthy hop notes to balance. Bittersweet chocolate and pleasant roastiness supplement the delicious bready quality.    Noticeable carbonation and slight alcohol warmth. Medium body. Refreshing and comforting at the same time.    Delicious beer with sumptuous bready character, nice supporting hop presence, and undeniable drinkability.

Aroma was the usual droppings of chocolate and coffee from the roasted malt.    Taste, a thick, chewy chocolate malt and coffee impression. Nothing adjuncty, nothing out of the ordinary, just one of those prototype kind of porters. This one tames down the hopping and bitterness compared to another prototype like Sierra Nevada. All good, relatively sessionable and easy to drink. No frills. Elite 1st tier stuff.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Serving: Bottle into pint  Served: 6 May 2016    Appearance: Pours a deep reddish brown, definitely NOT black, crowned with a one-finger tan head. The head diminishes somewhat but leaves incredible lacing. Every sip all the way down the glass was marked by a perfect half-circle of bubbles.    Smell: Notes of black coffee, espresso, and a subtle roastiness. Some charred nuttiness.    Taste: Really nice blend of flavors here- the roasted malt definitely stands out without being abrasive. Notes of French roast coffee underly the whole thing, with a subtle hint of very dark chocolate to round it out.    Mouthfeel: Medium body, honestly. This doesn't feel big nor small on the palate, despite its rich color and flavor.    Overall: A magnificent porter and one that I think really speaks for itself. Highly recommended.

Brown bottle poured into a nonic. Dark, dark brown with a rich tan head that's not too big. Nice nose, raisiny and dark chocolate malty scent. Taste hits with bitterness and leanness rather than sweetness, though there's some sweetness underneath. Rich and somewhat complex malt and hops interplay. Mouthfeel creamy but fades cleanly.

However, I think many other American crafters in the last two decades have exceeded Edmund Fitz. I'm curious to have another Great Lakes American Porter below 37IBU and test my theory. Any suggestions?    As for my review of EF... Looks are average. Smell gives lots of toasty, roasted malt and chocolate and coffee. All that comes through in this well-integrated beer. But the after-taste stays too bitter and I like to blame that on the hops.    Reviewed in Roger Protz' "300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"   I expect I will have Edmund Fitz a tenth time before that happens.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 A-color is a very dark brown with ruby highlights in the light and two fingers worth of khaki colored head    S-smell is of chocolate, dark malt, and light coffee    T-taste is similar to the smell with a roasted malt backbone, chocolate, and roasted coffee    M-medium body, moderate carbonation, dry and roasted finish     Overall a great example for the style, very drinkable and great tasting   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This one was pretty "meh" for me. Based on prior reviews I might have gotten an off bottle or something. It was really thin and very little roast from the malts that I expected.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Poured from a bottle into a nonic pint.    Look is deep dark brown. Nice creamy layer on top and respectable lacing.  Smell is 58% dark malts, 34% coffee, 6% sweet cigar, and a fleeting 2% dried cherries or generic acidic fruitiness.    Beautiful malts in the nose set expectations.  Taste has initial (albeit lesser) roasted malt and burnt sugar. By mid swallow malts are gone and you're left with char. The aftertaste goes to the hop end of the seesaw with an herbal, grassy bitterness.    Overall, I feel like the malts walked out and left me holding the charred herb check.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 I really wanted to like this, but ... I couldn't quite make it work. It poured a lovely, rich, dark mahogany with a smallish head. The aroma was full of promise - roasted coffee, toasty malts - but the delivery started out more bitter than smooth and mellow. As the glass warmed in my hand, it improved, but not enough to redeem it.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Porters are sort of hard to pinpoint. Kind of a blurry line between them and stouts. Be that as it may, as a beer this is certainly great whatever you want to call it.     Pours a very dark brown with an amberish hue. Smells like what you would expect, coffee, roasted malts, subtle fruits. Taste follows, strong malty coffee/espresso, hints of fruits (i find this to be highly subjective as what you will pick out, to me raisins/prunes and cherry) and a balancing earthy bitterness.     Maybe a bit thin on the mouth? But like I said porters are a strange beast so I wont knock it too much for that. Otherwise, probably the best Porter i've had.

Chilled to 39 degrees, allowed to sit for 10 minutes unopened, poured into oversize wine glass.    Look: Poured a dark ebony brown/black color with a 1/2" dark khaki color head that dissipated fairly quickly leaving a thin ring of foam. Swirling the glass produced a modest bit of lacing.    Smell: Coffee and chocolate, caramel malt, maybe a hint of nuttiness.    Taste: Bold coffee and roasted/burnt malt, chocolate, cola, a hint almost of wine or champagne flavors. A slight but not unpleasant grassy aftertaste. Hop flavors balance nicely, with a smokey touch.    Mouthfeel: Creaminess despite the lack of a bigger head at the pour, carbonation is light but noticeable early on dropping off later as it warmed. I felt a little tingle on the lips, again not unpleasant.    Overall: I've only tried a few porters since getting deeper into craft beers so I'm no expert but I feel this beer certainly represents the style very well and I look forward to trying this one again (and again!). One of the best I have tasted.

(still carbonated). ..don't like to describe as chocolate, but most certainly has that attribute. smooth, smooth, smooth, with the only bite coming from the bubbles. multi layered across the spectrum of flavors. ..but all complimentary. not sweet..and not TOO bitter.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours dark coffee color with off white decent head. Smells sweet, chocolate, coffee, roasted malt. Taste is robust, has more bitterness too it, roasted malts, mild chocolate and coffee flavors. Has moderate carbonation, somewhat smooth and creamy. Overall it is a great beer, one of my favorite styles. Seems more on the bitter side than I prefer for this style but, still very drinkable.I am from Ohio and I always seem to rate GL beers lower than average, I am not sure what it is about them, they all have a specific flavor I find less desirable.

Smell may be the best thing about this to me, though it's on the subtle side--chocolate, coffee, dark fruits and roasty malt. Taste is heavier on the roasty (somewhat burned tasting) malts. Doesn't really have the complexity hinted at by the smell. Feel is thin and watery to me. Overall a decent porter, but not really a standout.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Great Lakes Brewing Co. - Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. 6% ABV. 12oz bottle poured into stout glass. Best by 12/20/15.    Look: Pours a deep caramel color, and settles a very rich dark brown, retaining caramel highlights. A fair sized finger white head remained shortly, before disappearing completely.    Smell: Rich coffee notes, and some dark cocoa, accompanied by a nice smoky/charred aspect. Some faint caramel, dark malts, brown sugar, and dark fruits are present, although not as profound.    Feel: Medium bodied, and heavily carbonated.    Taste: Rich bitter coffee, engulfed by charred smokiness, followed by some dark cocoa. About midway through, the coffee mellows out, and some of the caramel, malts, and dark fruits appear, but are soon drowned by the coffee returning into the back end.    Overall: I had heard a lot of good things about this, so I finally decided to pick up a bottle, albeit it was about a week past its BB date. It seemed as good as it should, with a nice bold aroma and taste.

Smell is old school roasted malt, coffee, tobacco, and milk chocolate.    Taste is roasted malt, toast, bitter coffee, dark gingerbread, subtle molasses, and a little cigarette ash. Actually, this is a really complex beer for a simple porter.    Full and soft frothy body with a dry finish.

The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Delicate lace weaves around the glass.  The smell started off with a big roasty coffee bean balancing into delicate cocoa bean tones.  The taste was basically the same with a lingering dry roasty aftertaste running into the finish.  The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fairly nice sessionable feel about it. Carbonation seems to run nicely.  Overall, a really good American Porter that I know I would have again.

Roasted malt and cocoa taste with a slight balanced bitterness on the end. Moderate carbonation and a nice medium feel. This is a really great porter.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 | overall: 4 11/12/15    Standard pint glass    A – Pours a rich dark brown color. Carbonation evident. About a finger of fairly sudsy, off-white head.    S – Malts up front. Deep fruits. Some chocolate tones.    T – Malts and dark chocolate initially. Very strong coffee presence in the finish.    M – Medium bodied. Moderate carbonation. Fairly wet.    O – Interesting but good. Coffee is a bit too present off the get-go, but it moderates. A perfect choice for the late Fall. Overall, a good choice, but my ratings may come in below the average for this one seeing the high regard in which it is held.

The color appears nearly black, but holding it to the light, the bottom of the glass is a deep, ruby red. It features a creamy, milk-white head and extensive lacing. The smell features burnt coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, cracker, and brown sugar. The taste is not as sweet as the nose: coffee, bitter chocolate, char, and nutty pine, with sour, bitter finish. As the glass warmed, I also detected a very slight sweet after taste. This is a creamy, medium-bodied porter with a pleasant mouthfeel and very easy to drink at 6% ABV. Overall, this is a very fine American Porter. Great Lakes produces some delicious, albeit quirky beers!

Everything I want in a porter. Lowerish abv, not overpowering but by no means weak. GLBC knows how to make a good malty beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Fantastic porter! Certainly a bittersweet tribute as the bottle suggests. The smell and flavor really hit you with sweet chocolate in the beginning and finished with a malty bitter aftertaste (not overpowering bitter, but feels just right with this beer). The mouthfeel for me was very pleasing; not quite thick creamy but chewy enough to be what I personally like in a porter. This is a great beer to warm the bones after a cold day raking wet leaves or cleaning out the gutters in fall.

S - Wonderful rich dark chocolate aroma, cream, some char, and a hint of caramel.    T - Much of the same carried over from the aroma: big roasted chocolate flavor throughout with some creaminess, light char, and a lingering bitter chocolate and pine bite to balance out the roast.    M - Big and full body with a velvety texture. Coats the mouth with a thick layer of deep roasted chocolate with some smokiness.    O - It doesn't get much better than this when it comes to American Porters.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.5 So glad I decided to kick off the winter season with a case of this stuff. Absolutely everything I could ask for in a porter. I haven't had too many American Porters before - most of the ones I've had have been Baltic. This is like a baltic, but with the flavor turned up to 11.    A: Beautiful brown head and deep chocolate color    S: Smell is relatively tame. Mostly just roasted malts and some caramel    T: Very balanced, a hair on the sweet side. Heavy caramel roasted malt taste with a medium amount of hop bitterness and a surprisingly high amount of hop taste as well. Really delicious flavor that is way beyond what the 6% ABV label would suggest. The amount of flavor is on part with imperial stouts I have had from other companies, and the quality is there to boot.    M: Medium amount of carbonation. A bit heavy to be sessionable perhaps.    Overall I would highly recommend this beer and I do plan on buying it again. I have yet to be unimpressed by a Great Lakes beer. This company is putting out some seriously top notch stuff!

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 I really like the Great Lakes Brewing Company, because they are world class. The Bros really speak highly of this variety and so I had to try it. This one is an even 6.0% ABV and has a lot to offer. Let me tell you about this brew.    Look-It pours a dark black that is deeper than the depths of the Great Lakes where the fated Fitzgerald lies for eternity. The head pours thick and rich silky foam that is off-white like the foam on the lake shores after a torrential storm where waves twenty feet high pound the coastline. The lacing is perforated and foamy like the rock-smashed hull of the ship.     Smell-It smells of roasted caramel malts and chocolate infused coffee. Grains and hints of Beachwood swim and waft among aromas of caramel and smoky barrels like the aftermath of the cataclysmic wreck of the Fitzgerald.    Taste-The taste reliably follows the nose much like the Fitzgerald followed the storm swells into its chaotic demise. The caramel, coffee, and chocolate fill ones senses much like the icy cold waters of the Great Lakes inexorably filled the hull of the fated ship. A mild sweetness is tempered by grassy seaweed hops, from the depths of the Great Lakes, that exhibit an herbal quality.     Mouthfeel-It feels like silky smooth wetness from the perilous dark waters of the Great Lakes. The medium-bodied creaminess reflects off the foam churned waters of the Lakes. It leaves a coating of chocolate esters and smoky grains on the tongue much like the deep floors of the depths of the Great Lakes are coated in the corpses of untold thousands of fated ships that dared cross these perilous Lakes.     Overall-This beer is world class for a reason and I think that you should pull up the anchor and sail out to grab a six pack or two of these dark delicious beauties. But beware, if you drink too many, you may find yourself at the cold dark depths of a lake of shameful hangover. Be sure to wash down this beauty with some fresh water, because you won’t be able to stop popping the top of the depth of this darkness.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 More hops than your typical porter, which makes the flavor more interesting. Tons of chocolate and coffee notes, as advertised. Great beer! 
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Clear, brownish body with a thick, chunky, dense head; body can look almost black in some light conditions. Cocoa and mild chocolate aroma; slight vanilla note. Roasted, slightly charred grain flavor; nuts; bitter chocolate; vanilla; nice, crisp bitterness. Medium-heavy in body; starts somewhat dry but adds a decent sweetness at the finish.    A very fine, very delicious porter that combines all its properties into one very pleasing product. Dark grain sweetness, a smidge of astringency; and just-so edge of hop bitterness make for a well-balanced, fairly complex drinking experience.

The beer is even better than the song, and I love Gordon Lightfoot. (Who doesn't?)    This is what a Porter should be. Black. Malty. Vanilla. Light Sweetness - almost Fruit. Smokey. Caramel. A little thin, but still spectacular for a beer that is readily available.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Remarkable porter that pours very dark with a nice head. Tastes of coffee and caramel. Beginning to really like porters and thus far this has been my favorite. Not great with in depth analysis of beers, this is just really good.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Look:  Pours a very dark brownish-red (that's nearly black). The 12 oz. bottle was a bit lower in carbonation than expected with only a 1 finger head. Foam that is present is a nice tan/khaki color. Lacing is nice after the head recedes.    Smell:  Smells of chocolate and smoked malt with a fruity tartness.    Taste:  First there's an attack of hops that bites firmly and quickly offset with chocolate, coffee, toffee, and caramel flavors. The rich sweetness of these flavors nicely balance out the hop bitterness. There are nice smokey and woodsy flavors throughout. Next, the sweetness is cut by a slight fruitiness and a dry finish. Then you are left with a smoked malt / charred wood aftertaste.    Feel:  Very nice medium mouthfeel. Not too heavy or syrupy and offers some bubbles on the tongue.    Overall:  This is a great porter and was my "GATEWAY" beer. I had this beer over a decade ago (back when I didn't like beer because I didn't know what real beer was) and it changed me. Back then this was the most amazing beer I had ever had, but now it is just really good as I have had so many outstanding beers since. "Just really good" is still really good. I recommend it highly to anyone, even if they say "no, I don't like dark beers".

Billowy creamy white colored head forms, settles and leaves behind some fairly consistent lacing.    S — Smells quite fruity for the style, I am picking up lots of cherry, raisin, and a bit of sweetness. That subsides and leads way to a nutty and chewy profile of vanilla, roasted malts, and burnt sugar.    T — Tastes quite nice, big notes of vanilla, dark fruits, caramel, roasted malts, brown sugar, really nice.    M — Medium bodied, ample carbonation, really smooth as well.

The bitterness is well balanced by the sweet malt. Many layers of flavor here. Nice bread crust in a semi dry finish.     F: A bit chewier than the typical porter I think. Medium body and Low carbonation.    O: The flavor surprised me. The smell doesn't compare to the explosion of big flavor in this beer. Everything balances well and it has a brilliant complexity. There's a bit of warming in the finish. Quickly becoming one of my favorite porters. Well done.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Thanks Ozzylizzard for a great trade!    A : The body is chocolate brown and 100% opaque. The head pours 1 finger, retaining a beige/pink color and leaving small hills of lace like coffee froth on the sides of the pint glass. Soon the head is reduced to a creamy lid simply capping off the dense body.     S : Chocolate and black licorice both tag team and fight for dominance, behind that a sweet aromatic vanilla cream and some slight blended coffee and malts. A solid aroma that remains simple and sweet...but for me it's just not loud enough and lacks depth.     T : It's strong off the bat with alcohol and lots of charred barley, but I'm lacking some serious wow factor here. The off-note seems to be from fresh peeled and eaten snap peas, it's just very vegetal. Beyond that I'm tasting vanilla bean, dark coffee, cacao nibs, and graham cracker. There's a hint of bubble gum behind it as well, and while I like those yeasty flavors, in a Porter style it doesn't belong.    For some reason I just think of a piano when I'm tasting this. It's a mental picture. I'm not sure why. It's classy, glassy, elegant, with ivory and ebony notes (vanilla and chocolate respectively). It sits heavy in the belly and fills me up more than I'd like to be.     F : It's sticky, thick, rich, and sappy. I like it, it's the proper thickness, and ends with roasted coffee dryness and slight wet parchment paper.    O : It's a solid beer but in my opinion, far from the "world class" rating it gets. I've had much better porters and I don't think I'll be going back to this one again.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Not porter guy per SE. I think most breweries make them too sweet or too dark so when I have a good one I appreciate it... And this is one is awesome. It's better on tap then in a bottle but still fantastic.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 What a fantastic porter, I'd put this up there with Founders Porter as one of my favorites in the style category with a slight edge going towards founders.    Tan foamy head of a finger or two depending on the pour, laces well. Aromas of toasty bread, a light coffee note, and dark chocolate. Flavors are more toasted wheat bread crust and roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, which I feel is something that separates porters from stouts (especially imperial) even though there really isn't a textbook definition of what delineates these beer styles.     So happy to have finally procured this in NJ, sadly my home state of CT doesn't carry Great Lakes. Worth seeking out, I can only imagine what this is like on tap.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 One of the best porters readily available- may be the best available tbh. Pours black, nice coffee on the nose with a little cocoa and an almost licorice scent. Thin, but that is to be expected as this ABV. A masterpiece in every way for the style.

Tastes follows, but not overly roasted or bitter. Smooth, medium feel. Highly drinkable. Something to have again and again.

Definitely get cocoa and a bit of coffee.    On the palate lots of cocoa, a bit of burnt sugar (think roasted marshmellow), and some coffee.    Medium mouthfeel. Remains crisp, not too thick.

Little to no carbonation with thin creamy caramel color head. Taste immediately like coffee and toffee with a milder coffee finish. Lacing is very good.

Time to rate it, but critically, because I've been thinking for a while that our local favorites at great lakes need to look at doing a v2 of some of these venerable brews.    Its dark and has a great head and nice small bubbles. The aroma is clean, roastyand malty.     The taste is a great balance of roast, sweet malts, and a bit of hops. Very drinkable and refreshing for an American Porter. The aftertaste lingers perfectly. It is a great Porter but ....    I would like to see the raising of the Edmund Fitzgerald. A slightly bigger version. I loved Alberta Clipper, with its fruity overtones. A new version of this, like the Stone 2.0 versions, is due (and a new label does not count).

Smoky, chocolate, vanilla, coffee notes in flavor. Creamy, firm mouth feel with just the right amount of carbonation and a slightly dry finish. One of the best porters I have tried! I think I'll pour the next one into a tulip glass to really let it breathe.

Smell: cocoa, vanilla, smoky coffee notes, a sweetness that I can't quite place... exquisitely smelling beer.    Taste: I'm not sure I can adequately convey how awesome this tastes. There is a smoky coffee flavor pervading throughout. Choco-vanilla and some dark fruit notes (dates?) are also present. The coffee flavor gives it a bitterness that rounds out the swallow and leaves you with a pleasant smoky aftertaste.    Mouthfeel: low fizziness and a creamy, somewhat heavy feel, almost stout-like.     Just an intense, beautiful drinking experience. Honestly.

Retention is pretty good. Lacing is not really present.    S: Cocoa & vanilla jump out of the glass. Almost some pitted fruit/dark berry undertones. Brown sugar. Smells great.    T: Following the nose this is a bit of a disappointment. Milk chocolate & raspberry are the two components that seem to dominate the palate. A skootch of hop-bitterness toward the finish. Not as complex as I'd hoped.    M: Lowish carb & perfectly, silkily creamy feel. Just heavy enough on the palate to remind you that you're drinking a porter.    O: There are high notes & there are average notes. Nothing about this brew is sub-par.

Smell is coffee, coco, and roasted malts. Classic porter aroma    Taste follows smell exactly! Again very classic porter flavor profile. Roasted malts and coco sweetness followed by coffee and black licorice.     Overall this is a craft beer classic and should be enjoyed by every beer enthusiast at least once.

A little duller than usual.    Taste: Slightly tart, dry arrival. Clean, slightly sweet, earthy, roasty mid-palate. Damp leaves. Bitter, roasty finish.    Mouthfeel: Good weight without being heavy. Solid carbonation. Not slick.    Overall: A real winner. I will buy this every winter, without fail, because it is consistently excellent.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 L - 12 oz bottle, poured to pint glass. 1 1/2 finger of slightly off white head that slowly dwindles to a very persistent foamy ring . Near black appearance but when held to light shows beautiful clarity - dark brown with a dark red tint. Looks awesome.  S - Coffee, unsweetened cocoa. A hint of spice. Robust. Rich aroma.  T - Rich malt, roasty character that stays with you after each sip. Bittersweet chocolate/cocoa is the primary flavor. Perhaps the slightest hint of spicy hop character comes through as well, along with an equally slight hint of alcohol. Amazing perfect combination of flavors.  F - For me perhaps the only place I'd want a little more - wish this was just the slightest bit "chewier." Not thin and watery by any means but I'd like just a little more body. Carbonation spot on.  O - I'm still relatively new to rating beers (although several of those I've rated are beers I've had a number of times). Still when actually breaking it down and analyzing what I'm tasting, it seems I can still be surprised by familiar beers. This is one of those - I've always liked this beer but never quite realized how good it really is. I will probably never give a 5 in any category just to leave room for something unexpected so for me this beer makes a very close run at "perfection." Amazing job on this one GLBC.    *** As a chef, one of my "signature dishes" is a coffee rubbed, porter braised short rib. Guess what beer is the secret ingredient? ***   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Chocolate brown body with minimal khaki head. A sweet, smokey nose similar to tobacco. Very pleasant. Tastes of sweet tobacco, toasty malts, and bitter hops. Bitter notes prevail, and tobacco lingers in the aftertaste, but no flavor is pronounced. Mouthfeel is dryish and lightly carbonated. Overall, a very sessionable porter with an accessible flavor profile. I wish there was more of a statement from this brew, as nothing makes this beer excellent, but definitely well-crafted and enjoyable.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter  sipped out of a Sam Adams curvey taster glass, ABV says %6 on the bottle and on the website, IBU are 37 as listed on the website as well.    Appearance: It is black with a reddish brown tint when holding it up to the light. There was a 2 inch. head that dissapated to a small ring fairly quickly.  Nose: It has a decent bit of smells going on here. Mainly coffee, chocolate, malty smells here.  Taste: Sweetness, dark malt, chocolate, coffee, also got a slight nutty taste. It is pretty standard dark beer. I think it is a good porter, but nothing jumps out at me that makes this stand out among other porters/stouts. The sweetness is nice because I like a good sweet porter.   Moulth: Not much carbonation, pretty light(maybe not compared to an ale), drinkable  I would say a light body for a porter/stout.   Overall: I think I would have it again given that it is a good, solid, robust porter. I wouldn't really seek it out right away because it is pretty standard stuff.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 4 12 oz. Bottle poured into a tapered pint glass    Strong coffee notes on the nose. Coffee on the palate with chocolate at the end. Not much texture to it. Pretty strong beer.

Color: Deep amber black, with reddish copper head  Nose: Dark coffee, vegetative (green pepper?), earthy / soil, caramel  Taste: Vanilla, coffee, milk chocolate, malt, caramelized sugar, toffee, tootsie roll, light metallic / aluminum tinge, mild saltiness, tobacco  Finish: Dark chocolate, tobacco  Mouthfeel: Rich, creamy - almost milky smooth

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours brilliant ruby brown under a creamy light brown head that grips the inside of the glass. Big malt aromas with hints of chocolate but no harsh or burnt aromas. The palate follows the nose - creamy snooth light chocolate flavors, well balanced with a light hop accent on the finish.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 From a single into a Yeti snifter (tasted side-by-side with Founders', Odell's, and Deschutes' porters)    A: black/brown and a khaki/linen 1 finger head  S: (best among all four tasted), faint smokiness, roasty and bittersweet but not very chocolatey (compared to the others), then finally a little fruity/herbal hoppiness  T: follows the nose, aggressive, a little burnt coffee bean... a lot going on here and nice integration  M: fairly chewy and substantial, medium carbonation, smooth but a little aggressive    Overall, I've enjoyed this one many times on its own, so it was interesting to taste against others that also seem like they're at the top of the class. With the Deschutes, this was the hoppiest, but EF has a more fruity and herbal twist which integrates into the roasted dark malts better, and has a more substantial mouthful. This one has the best nose, but it wasn't quite as rich and smooth and luxurious as the Founders in taste or mouthful...indeed, in comparison, I felt like it had a bit too much going on. Still, very very enjoyable.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 4.5 Appearance: dark but near opaque. Two finger tan head.     Aroma: chocolate, light roasted notes, some husky/woody notes that I like, hints of fruit but not much, hints of black licorice but not strong like star anise. It's like being in an old wooden shed (or perhaps a wheelhouse!) sets the mood for me.    Taste: roasted malt, some metallic taste is in there but not bothersome to me. Husky grain/woody character (makes the beer for me). Some lingering bitterness but not much. Just enough to make me go back for the next sip.     Mouthfeel: light to medium mouthfeel. It does border watery but, running it between my teeth makes it creamy. Would like a bit more body.    Overall: Currently my favorite porter but I can't get it where I am in Texas (yet!). I got this sample on a trip to Virginia. I can drink several of these. This is a fine porter. It says, i'm a porter so don't look for a stout. I appreciate the brewery for not trying too kick it up a notch. It rests well where it is and tells its own story. Nice job Great Lakes Brewing!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 BBD 7/14/15. Pours a beautiful deep dark ruby that approaches black. Outstanding head volume and retention, world class lacing.    Rich nose of dark chocolate over a rich caramel malt base with a touch of roast.    Light medium body with a smooth texture that lacks creaminess. Above normal carbonation with a nice burst of effervescence in the middle and a prickly finish.    The flavor profile is less intense than expected, a bit complex and very well balanced. It begins with a slight baker's chocolate flavor that flows into a mild herbal bitterness in the middle. The richness of the nose never expresses itself. Roast appears in the middle - finish transition. Caramel never really becomes significant. The finish is a slow fade of roast and herbal hops.

Very lager-like balance with mild herbal hops.	  Feel: Medium body, nice carbonation.     Overall: A classic porter for me. This one is robust yet very drinkable and notable for its clean lager-like caramel flavor that blends nicely with the roasted notes.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 12oz bottle from Justdoit1234 (thanks). Bottled 7/24/14. Served in a goblet.     Pours a dark tea brown with a finger of biege head. Decent retention around the edges which deposit a few clumps of lace.     Straight forward nose with notes of roasted malts, cocoa and a hint of sugary sweetness.     Slightly more depth to the taste. Chocolate, toasted malts, burnt sugar and mild coffee. It goes down easily with no perceptible alcohol. The flavors are smooth and balanced but nothing really pops.    Smooth feel, on the lighter side of medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes with more of the same- roast, cocoa and moderate sweetness.     Edmund Fitzgerald is an unassuming and easy drinking porter. I tend to prefer a more assertive flavor profile but had no problems here. Solid stuff that could possibly serve as a an introduction to dark beers for the uninitiated.

Creamy and fairly full bodied for the style. A very solid porter.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.5 Appearance - 3.5/5  A very dark brown-red. A tiny amount of light comes through the beer (i.e. it is slightly clear). Light chocolate brown head, but it dissipates down quickly.    Smell - 4.25/5  Chocolate/cocoa, roastiness, nuttiness, hops. Smells delicious.    Taste - 4.5/5  Tastes basically like the smell. Roasty, chocolate, smoky, with a nice hints of hops which is not too much or too little, but just the right amount of hops for a porter.    Mouthfeel - 3.75/5  Medium-bodied. The beer is a little bit watery feeling, I would have liked for it to be a bit 'thicker'. The beer is very smooth, and there is a nicely balanced medium amount of carbonation.    Overall - 4.5/5  I remember this being one of my favorite porters/stouts, but today when I reviewed, I was a bit underwhelmed. It didn't taste exactly like I remembered. Mainly I don't remember it feeling so watery. But it was still great. I would highly recommend this to everyone.

This one just hit it way out of the ball park!    Appearance: jet black with a 1.5 inch head.    Smell: Roasty but then getting into a milk stoutish character. Some milk chocolate notes and some faint black coffee notes. Not fruity.    Taste: Unreal. slightly chocolatey, a little black malt, mocha, and some faint mint.    Feel: super smooth. Just went down way too easily.    Overall: The best porter I have ever tasted by far. It just blows everyone else out of the water.

Taste is sweet malts forward, chocolatey, roasted nice balance with hops mid taste, a hint of salty soy sauce, with a hint of citrus/pine without being jarringly bitter and a clean, dry finish. Medium bodied with mild effervescence, very smooth and. Increases in complexity as it warms. Overall, great representative of this beer variety, price point is good for such an incredible beer.
