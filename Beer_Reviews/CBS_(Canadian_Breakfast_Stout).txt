I have several reasons, but it mainly boils down to having two little ones and too limited an amount of time keep writing these reviews (over 458,700 words and counting – that’s enough to fill a novel FFS). So I saved the best for last: Founders Canadian Breakfast Stout. Some ppl know me as “that guy wot wrote the most liked FBS review on BA” and I figured it rather fitting to review one of their most legendary brews: the maple syrup bourbon barrel ripper known affectionately as “CBS”. Spoiler alert: This’ll be bitchen.    Poured from a 355ml bottle into a Duvel tulip.    A: Pours richer, denser, more-viscous than FBS – Wow! What a demonic looking beast this Imp-Stout is! Blacker than a black heart covered in a tar-like ooze, with a thin ring of tan lace, this is the beer that launched a thousand beer nerds – to paraphrase Marlowe. 10/10.    S: Very much a KBS meets a maple syrup barrel kind of aroma: bourbon hints, oak/woody/vanilla tones, dark chocolate and roasted coffee… and of course the signature ingredient: maple syrup! There’s an odd pear/apple ester too – not sure what that’s doing here (not unlike the odd shochu character in KBS). Still this is a complex and well-rounded fragrance, superb work again from Founders. 9/10.    T: Hmmm, much sweeter than I recall KBS. I’m sure you’re thinking “derp man” however it is customary for sweeter flavours from a barrel to mellow out during the ageing – this just feels like KBS with maple syrup added post-ageing. That said, if you’re a sweet-tooth then this is maple heaven. Flavour profile is very much like KBS, powerful with notes of: roasted coffee, dark chocolate, bourbon, oak/woody/vanilla, molasses and a hint of coffee bitterness in the finish. 7/10.    M: Yep, there’s that Founders body – smoother than a Motown R&B singer, this is as heavy and luscious as they come – a perfect 10 like the other BS’s. 10/10.    D: Alas, for me this brew was sweet to the point of a needle – an insulin needle. Too much of a good thing, there is such a beer: Canadian Breakfast Stout. IMO the best of Founders is (and perhaps will always be) KBS. No lie – I struggled to finish this it was so sweet, paying $24 for the bottle helped it go down, I cant abide wasting a beer at this price point. Sorry for the (semi)-sad ending. 8/10.    Food match: Perhaps pancakes could soak up this sugar-bomb of a brew?

Feel: thick and syrupy   Overall: a great dessert beer. Glad I got to try some on tap. Might be too heavy for a full pint, but a 9-12 oz pour puts you in a good place.

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Decanted from a 25.4 oz (750 ml) bottle into a customer taster pint; 2017 release.  A: Pours a deep mahogany to black color with about a one finger, light brown head, retention to a full cap, and spidery lacing.  S: Aromas of dark chocolate, vanilla, whiskey, honey, molasses, plum, and dark roasted coffee.  T: More semisweet than sweet. Flavors follow the nose and work together well on the palate. Bitterness solid and provides strong counterpoise to the sweetness.  M: Full bodied with moderate effervescence.  O: Opened this to celebrate my Father-in-law's 95th birthday. Had read about it and ultimately traded for it (thank you Rkitchen!). This is a great stout: it drinks smoothly, it is not overly sweet, it is complex and balanced (no easy feat for a flavor-adulterated stout). Really just a gorgeous olfactory and gustatory experience. Thankfully, I was able to procure the 2018 release locally and am looking forward to an occasion to open it.

Thick and velvety texture to the beer; heavy with residual sugars    This is one damn fine beer! Great appearance and aroma but, brother, the taste and mouthfeel are exceptional.

Deeply black, with only a tinge of ruby around the edges with a back light. Short tan head, creamy and thick, that falls quickly to a ring. Wonderfully thick and creamy body. Initial taste is vanilla, cinnamon, and coffee; just a little whiskey. The finish is slightly bitter, but the sweet malts remain throughout.

This mighty malt bomb pours a rich coal black  with a nice head of tan foam that subsides to a thick ring, thin pool with a sudsy side  saddle, and a nice sudsy and soapy lacing. Nose of coffee, dark fudge, maple, mild bourbon,   and laced with touches of vanilla and brulee. Flavors show a fine balance of flavors  for such a heady brew. Vanilla and rich dark cocoa laden fudge align nicely against  a dark bitter coffee background that is awash in brulee and mild bourbon with a   balanced maple note that is mild without being overpowering. Exceptional  mouth feel; full rich body, medium light soft carbonation that is just enough   to give some light effervescence to this beast with a rich and lightly coating   sweet and bitter malt finish.    Overall----it's Founder's....it's killer----DUH!    This deftly crafted imperial is on par to be one of my favorites minus the price tag  and has helped pull me away from my of late distaste for sweet imperial stouts.  It shows balance and fine crafting.     Cheers!

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Matte black body. Bubbly, active two finger head the color of brown leather. Sticky, webbed lacing.  Big aroma of maple and chocolate. There is a beer there somewhere as I can detect the roasted malts of an imperial stout. Also some coffee. And wood.  The malts come out a bit more in the taste. The sweetness of the maple mixed with the chocolate give the impression of chocolate milk. The barrel flavor and nip of bourbon give the impression of chocolate milk with a drop of bourbon. The beer in general gives the impression that I would have saved some money making chocolate milk and dropping in a shot of bourbon.  The body is syrupy smooth. Heavy with medium-low carbonation. Uninteresting finish.    The beer is drinkable. I am sure it is priced according to all that goes into it. It is just too damn sweet.

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 2018 Release    L - Jet black, inky pour. Frothy brown (with a hint of orange) head. Varying sizes of bubbles, and sticky on the side of the glass. Looks perfect.    S - The bourbon really comes through heavy here. Just opening the bottle almost got a waft like opening a bottle of bourbon. Peat and grass in the background, a little smoky, but mostly sweet. Some butterscotch, chocolate, and vanilla.     T - Much less bourbon than the aroma would have suggested... though still there. A lot of sweetness coming through, maple syrup, brown sugar. A little smoky malt bitterness wants to come through, but the sweetness wins that battle.     F - Light carbonation, expected some real sticky feel and while the stickiness is there, it comes across as more smooth and silky. Not light, but not nearly as heavy as I would have thought.     O - Lived up to the hype. Great choice for my #1000.

Very pretty aroma, chocolate, lots of chocolate, coffee, maple & alcohol. Plenty of chocolate sweetness balanced with coffee bitterness. Flavor wise I was expecting more maple, it is still delicious, very sweet & I like that. Feel is viscous & velvety. I think it is slightly lacking in barrel flavors. At $26 , it is the most I’ve paid for a bottle & certainly worth trying but not quite as god as bourbon county stout. Still it is one the best & should be on everyone’s must try lists.

L: dark, like a stout of this type should look  S: brown sugar, chocolate, malt, hint of coffee and vanilla  T: At first it's sweet, then as you adjust it gets more complex. The maple is there but not particularly pronounced.  F: thick, the flavor lingers    O: this was a "whale" beer for me, Had it on my 50th b-day. It was a treat, and I'll get some more next time it comes around.

Appearance: Semi thick, dark black body with medium bubbles creating a tan head which rose nudge over a finger's length. Settles steady nice and even after one or two sips.     Smell: Milk chocolate and whiskey aroma accompanied by doses of brown sugar. It's a warm scent and literally lingers in your nostrils.     Taste: Sweet complex taste of chocolate which is so evident and complex whiskey with maple. It's a touch overpowering sweet when you start sipping and it's definitely distinct but honestly I was expecting more from the brew.     Mouth: what can I say this beer is sticky, medium carbonation with a super Full body and lingering after taste which overpowers anything you are eating with it.     Overall: Nice pick up but personally founders does make better imperial Stouts and you know where to look if you really want them. Always in a glass, Salud!

Look- Thick frothy light brown head 2 finger widths tall.Dark black body with no light showing through.Very little small bubbles,stuck to the bottom of the glass,otherwise not much going on.    Smell- I get heavy notes of chocolate,coffee,maple syrup,and bourbon.It has a really nice smell.    Taste- This one is really strong.Then again it’s been a long time since I drank an imperial stout.I get dark and sweet chocolate,up front with some faint maple syrup.Strong notes of dark black coffee,and bourbon on the back end.Nice dark malty after taste long after the booze subsides.    Feel- Very heavy body with a thick syrupy texture.Chalky in the mouth after swallowing.Very nice feel in the mouth.    Overall- This is a really nice beer.I probably would have appreciated it more 2 years ago when I was drinking a lot of stouts.But this was still a very enjoyable beer for me,even with the high ABV.I would recommend anyone who likes stouts try this beer.

The nose is coffee, chocolate, and a pastry/cinnamon bun sweetness. Definitely some maple vibes with whispers of bourbon.    The taste is similar. This is essentially a sweeter version of KBS. I get mocha and maple, with hints of bourbon and wood on the backend. The sweetness is tame and balanced and rounds out the beer.    The mouthfeel is medium+. Not quite syrupy but big.    Overall, awesome stuff. It's balanced for what it is. Don't expect a wallop of maple or a dessert stout explosion. Every flavor is equally represented.

Smoky and oaky nose, with lots of sugars dancing about. The maple is obvious, and earthy-sweet bourbon notes linger.    Super sweet flavor profile, even more than expected. Tons of maple essence, bourbon. Sweet, caramelly notes absolutely dominate, as oak and coffee take a back seat. Plenty of chocolate and carob as well. You can get a tiny amount of that kind of rubbery, astringent signature Founders stout flavor (the flavor in KBS that's unmistakable), but it's so overwhelmed by a sugary onslaught your palate soon forgets. Finishes very long and sweet. In fact, it doesn't really finish.    Fun to drink, but this beer was a little overhyped because of its previous relative scarcity.

But once I poured this fabulous stout in a proper glass, the smell (bouquet?) was legit. More maple and coffee than chocolate... It also has very nice smokey undertones. CBS has a solid head and pitch black body.  Seriously smooth for a 11abv stout. Doesn't have a strong boozy taste or smell of others in its abv category. A top tier and pretty complex stout! 4.75 - 5

L: 1F tan head with very good retention, Leaves some lacing and a nice tan cap and ring. Beer is dark black.    S: Coffee, cocoa, and a bit of oaky bourbon barrel. Some maple sweetness. Good, but I expected it to be more authoritative.    T: I GOT YOUR AUTHORITATIVE RIGHT HERE. Wow. Flavor waves of coffee and cocoa and roasted malts, with the bourbon barrel just in the background, but definitely the right amount. Maple sweetness comes in, but while the maple taste is authoritative, the sweetness is not cloying and is nicely cut by both the roast and the ABV. Yeah, baby, this is the stuff.    F: Medium to full-bodied, Slightly carbonated. Construction superb, balance right up there as well. Drinks unbelievably well for a high ABV stout.    O: Believe the hype. Even with the increased production, this is for real.

S - Brazilian coffee... Fudge brownies... Perhaps just a faint hint of the maple syrup... Mildly intoxicating...    T - Starts like most stouts - roasted malts, chocolate and hints of coffee... The sweetness dials up in intensity throughout... Teeters on a touch cloying towards the finish, but never quite gets there... Very good balance and complexity...    F - Dense and lush... On the fuller side of full bodied... Rich and creamy... Did I mention lush?     O - Outstanding beer... Excellent as anticipated... I've drank tons and tons of stouts and this is rather unique... The sweetness is unlike anything else I've ever tried... The mouthfeel is word class... Worth the elevated price I was forced to pay, but a worthy in indulgence...

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 355 ml bottle served cold into a Chimay chalice. LCBo purchase for $8.50 CDN. Only the highest rated beer, I've had the chance to sample. I guess this makes for a good New Year's Day brew, kick it off in style. 11,6% ABV and best before September 24, 2019.    Appearance - Thick and oily, midnight black in color with a dark tan head of about a finger. Moderate retention and a tiny bit of sparse lacing. Great looking brew.    Smell - Big smells of molasses, dark chocolate, coffee and maple syrup. Some bourbon and vanilla shine through as well. Complex and well put together. Maple and brown sugar show a little more after a few whiffs.     Taste - Molasses at first and quite a bit of unsweetened chocolate. Transitions to sweet maple syrup, but not too sweet. Lots of boozy bourbon and wood flavors towards the end as the is a restrained yet astringent quality to the bitterness. Really good stuff. If anything, I wouldn't object if the maple syrup came through just a tiny bit more.    Mouthfeel - Slick, dense and robust like liquid velvet. Boozy finish leaves a great warming sensation at the back of the throat.    Overall - Really, really good stuff, one of the best stouts I've had although I actually prefer the breakfast stout to KBS and CBS. Still, the maple is well ingrained, being present, but the beer is never too sweet and is really nicely balanced. Even at the extravagant price, complete worth picking up a bottle or 4 (as I did) since this calibre of brew doesn't come to these parts too often.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Serving: 750 ml bottle (“bottled on 10.08.18”), poured into a 9 oz Libbey Embassy snifter.    Appearance: Deep, dark inky black-brown with a short, thick head of mahogany foam and patchy lace.    Smell: Roasted malts and coffee beans, fruity chocolate, maple syrup, burnt caramel, and slight barrel char.    Taste: A big blast of sweet and roasted malt goodness. Coffee, chocolate and roasted malt add nutty, fruity and earthy bitter notes to balance the maple syrup and bourbon vanilla sweetness. Closes with just enough roasted bitterness.    Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with a velvety, creamy feel and soft to medium carbonation.    Overall: A big but harmonious brew; leaning a bit sweet, but still balanced and delicious.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Bottled 10/2/18.  Poured from a 750ml into a tulip.   Opaque black and gorgeous. Latte colored head with good retention and nice lacing.     Aroma is very nice but a bit overwhelmed by the alcohol for me with notes of maple, vanilla, dark chocolate, sour coffee, and wonderful oak.     Taste is superb with a smooth balance between all the major flavors. Semisweet chocolate hits hard up front and lingers nicely on the palate at the end. I get a subtle maple flavor upfront through midway, which is surprising as I expected a stronger maple flavor, but I’m happy that it’s subtle. Dark roast coffee, sweet roasted malt, and a bourbon barrel background round out the flavors for me. Alcohol is noticeably high as expected.     Mouthfeel is full and luxuriously smooth with a pleasant crispness (from the bitter malt maybe?) that balances the smoothness.     Overall, outstanding and fun but only once a year at best for me. A little too sweet is my only complaint. But that’s just me. The labeling clearly indicates you are in for a sweet beer.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 New release for 2018 and Wow! Maple and bourbon nose. Chocolate and coffee aromas are perfectly blended. Super smooth taste, more coffee taste emitted as it warms. Phenomenal beer at any Price. Compare to Old Curmugeon it has less maple taste.   Had it at Sisters’ Barn in Redondo Beach,Ca   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Ridiculously good. I didn't get much maple at all but it didn't take anything away from it. If they didn't put maple syrup barrels in the description, people would rate this even higher because they wouldn't be expecting a maple bomb. Mouth feel was almost perfect, coffee and chocolate were balanced perfectly with the sweetness. Not too much barrel which can sometimes overpower these barrel aged stouts. Overall it was worth the high price and I will buy it every year it's available.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Midnight black pour; multi-tonal brown head with spongy stratum of khaki, mocha, and mahogany. Hazelnut coffee, spelt grain chocolate chip pancakes, dark amber maple syrup. There's a little spice and heat from the barrel aging, and juxtaposes well against the sweetness of the malt and maple. Flavor parallels the nose tightly, but with more bittersweet accents of burnt pecan brittle, earthy smokiness. Herbal vanilla balances the deeply pronounced flavors of earth & wood. Body is expectedly full and velvety. Just acrid enough to not be super cloying although my lips still stick a bit.

S-Coffee is the first impression and the strongest aroma...kind of one dimensional....straining I get light whiffs of dark chocolate as well.    T-Coffee and espresso for sure but the chocolate notes are more evident here...kind of a mix of sugary milk chocolate and dark chocolate. Also a little char. Not getting much of the barrel aged notes or maple. if it's there it is pretty light and overwhelmed by these other characteristics.     F-Body is rich and full. It's not the biggest beer I've had in this style but it is right in the middle of what I'd expect body and feel wise. Not much sharp alcohol or heat.    O-Quality beer. Wish the maple and barrel aging came through a little more.

A sweetness pervades the nose, nice and syrupy.    Tastes of bourbon, with aged oak/sweet vanilla flavors, espresso, sweet milk chocolate. Closes with more sweetness and nice alcohol warmth.    Body is great. On the full/thick side for sure with a wonderful syrupy smoothness to it.     Overall the sweetness is almost closing but for a post meal beer it's on point. Defiy interesting and satisfying , but t me it's best in smaller doses. Split the bottle!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25 Big tan head upon a black smooth brew.     Espresso smell, some syrup/sugar notes    Sweet upfront and sweet at the finish. In between, complex flavors abound. Some coffee, some nutiness, much chocolate - especially as it warms. Desert quality and alcohol warmth. Perfectly smooth and exceptionally blananced.     Optimal in beginning sips but sweetness grew tired over time. Little to criticize, but if I had my druthers I would dial back the sweetness a touch.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 L - Pitch black with a thick, smooth, dark tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly yet leaves behind a solid amount of lacing. Exactly as a stout should look. If the head had stuck around longer I would have gave this 5/5.   S - Rich chocolate, coffee, and maple syrup along with some earthy notes. It's a pleasing smell, but I wish it were stronger.   T - Roasted and toasted malt and rich chocolate up front followed by notes of slightly bitter coffee and sweet maple syrup with sweet bourbon and a slight warming alcohol on the back end - but not offputting. Slight hints of vanilla throughout.   F - Full bodied with a light amount of carbonation. Smooth, soft, creamy, silky, decadent. Feels exactly as a stout of this magnitude should.   O - I've been waiting to have this for years and I have to say, while it doesn't blow me away like I might have thought it would, it definitely does not disappoint - it is one of the most well balanced bourbon barrel stouts I've ever had - all the flavor notes are there and the mouthfeel is incredible. Definitely one of the best BBSs I've ever had. Definitely one of the best beers I've ever had. Compared to KBS, the maple syrup adds a level of sweetness, richness, and overall smoothness that just adds to the experience.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2018 vintage. Deep and dark brown, basically black. Thick chocolate mousse colored head that slowly fades but never goes away, leaving nice lacing and a substantial ring of foam around the glass. Nice if roasted malts, coffee with hints of chocolate and maple as per the ingredients. What a delicious beer! Roasted malts with strong presence of coffee, chocolate and bourbon with that maple sweetness on the backend. Very well balanced! For an 11% beer aged in bourbon barrels it is not overly boozy. It's smooth with a soft finish, mild bitterness, chocolate and bourbon aftertaste. Not a fan of the format as there is 0.0z5 chance I could finish this on my own but as far as sharing a top notch beer with friends/family this is perfect!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 The nose has a pronounced coffee char and roastiness. However, there are no discernable bourbon notes. CBS is integrated exquisitely, it is smooth, an easy sipper and bold. The bitter baker's chocolate blends superbly with the mellow maple syrup sweetness. The body isn't viscous, and the stout isn't overly hot. I don't detect booze or the presence of the bourbon barrel. There might be a trace of vanilla in the finish. Admittedly, I love coffee in stouts, so the addition only serves to bolster an already well made stout.   The mouthfeel is a standout, there is a silkiness, and the mocha taste isn't cloying.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Pours midnight cavern on the dark side of the moon black. Clear and burgundy colored when bright light is passed through it. The pour produces a short finger of frothy, somewhat lasting, mocha head that leaves a thick surface cap, a decent collar but only a little lace above the collar. The head is sticky. Aroma is rich chocolate, maple, coffee & vanilla/oak. Alcohol is barely detectable in the nose until the beer has warmed. Taste is extra rich, dark semi-sweet chocolate, Hershey's Chocolate syrup, coffee, woody oak/vanilla, roast, toffee, brown sugar, bourbon with faint hints of fig and prune; earthy hints appear with light pepper in the finish; a mild bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. Alcohol becomes apparent by mid-sip and blossoms from there. Its presence runs the spectrum of flavor/spice, warmth and bitterness all melding in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with low-moderate carbonation, velvety smooth, silky and at the risk of being redundant creamy. Very warming in the mouth & throat especially in in the latter half of the sip & aftertaste. Its reputation is well deserved.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Dark brown color where no light passes through the edge. Lasting beige head which leaves many minor spots.     Very smooth, creamy cocoa aroma. Lots of subtlety with semisweet chocolate, light smoke, and vanilla.     The flavor is similar to the smell except there's no smoke and far more alcohol warmth to the tongue and throat. The feel is rich with a modest effervescence. This is a powerful beer with many soft touches: vanilla, Baker's chocolate, and cream. Long aftertaste.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Finally had at Cochon Butcher, New Orleans, on $14.00 draft into pint tumbler.    Many varied flavors are more subtle and balanced than expected, and maybe best of all hide the ridiculous ABV all too well.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Look: Black as night with a brown head. Chilled to ~50 degrees and poured into a tulip. Head faded rather quickly.    Smell: Coffee and maple predominant, chocolate there but less so. Smells rich and inviting.    Taste: Maple-syrupy sweetness on the front, rich coffee (predominantly) and chocolate on the middle, and a well-balanced touch of bourbon on the back end. The bourbon lingers for a bit in the back of the throat. I'm not a fan of cloying, sweet beers, but this is wonderful: Just enough sweetness on the front that quickly fades as the chocolate, coffee, and bourbon take over. The coffee and bourbon linger on the palate. Barely any heat, the alcohol is very well-hidden.    Feel: Medium- to full-bodied. Maybe slightly heavier than an IIPA (such as a Dogfish Head 90), but a tad lighter than other stouts I've had. Soft carbonation. A nice balance.     Overall: I like a lot of different styles, but stouts are usually not something I seek out. My go-tos are dank, cloudy New England-style IPAs or Belgian darks and saisons. One of my favorite stouts is Prairie Bomb and this reminds me of that, only "softer"... and without the chili peppers, but with the addition of maple. Very well-balanced and delicious. Recommended!

A passive pour yields a solid 1-plus F of dense mocha tan colored cap. Thick film and sticky rings of lacing remain throughout.    Maple, coffee, dark chocolate. The bourbon and alcohol have mellowed nicely while aging. Note of alcohol as it warms.    Flavors are more of the same. The maple sweetness is balanced by the coffee and chocolate bitterness. Finishes slightly sweet and chocolatey containing the alcohol.    Feel is full, smooth, and a bit sticky from maple and chocolate. Rich flavor and body carry the potency.    It's bourbon barrel aged with notes as such without the bourbon overkill. That's key to its overall enjoyability - for me.

Smells exactly like what's in it: pronounced maple, followed by chocolate, coffee, then bourbon.    Taste follows the nose. Initial sweetness of the maple with a good bourbon note followed by the dark chocolate and coffee bitterness balancing it out. Leaves a sweetness in your mouth afterwards with the lightest and most delicate bitterness of good dark coffee or chocolate. It is exactly what it says it is.    Feels thick and satisfying in the mouth. If you like thick rich imperials, this is what you want.    Overall, this year is a little sweeter than last year, but not cloying. I actually think 2018 is a bit more balanced all around than 2017 or 2016. I got several bottles with the plan to age one, and I just couldn't resist. This was absolutely stellar.

Chocolate, coffee, maple syrup, Bourbon, roasted malt. Pretty heavenly aromas.     The flavours merely back up what the aromas indicated. Nice barrel influence without being too aggressive. Maple syrup gives it a mildly sweet note, chocolate adds both bitter and sweet flavours, coffee is equally non aggressive with the abv being a non factor.     Silky smooth mouthfeel and each sip makes me appreciate it more.     World class? You betcha!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Long time want, now distributed here to California. 2018 release, 11.6%ABV. Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Portsmouth tulip.     Opaque, inky seal brown liquid supports a half finger of ecru suds, itself receding to a lasting collar and a smattering of residual surface foam. Rouse-able fine lacing; fast-running tears.     Sweet aroma with coffee, cocoa, and tobacco notes. Fairly restrained.    The flavor profile unfurls slowly, widening out with wave after wave of increasing complexity. Roast malt, dark roast (or perhaps overextracted) coffee, cherries, tobacco, burnt maple sugar, baker's chocolate - everything alternating between caramelized sugar and dry earthy notes. A touch of booze throughout. Some tannins and acidity, but never acrid. Long, lovely finish.     Creamy, medium-full bodied, and well carbonated, though a touch hot from the alcohol.     More complex than KBS, but perhaps not as well integrated, with more heat and fruit than the former.

Sweet rich aroma, big coffee first, then fades into sweet chocolate, and then sweeter syrup. Flavor is rich and thick, first barrel flavors, chocolate and lots of syrup, hints of coffee mixed in. Great feel, easy to drink, yet very full and thick. Overall, complex, flavorful, rich, on the sweeter side.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Pours black as a starless night. World class head volume, lacing and retention. Perfect.    World class nose. Rich nose of dark chocolate over a slightly sweet base with caramel and burnt sugar notes. Medium bourbon aromatics are coupled with light maple. Light roast with a touch of oak paired with light coffee. Delightfully complex and balanced. As it warms, sweet chocolate becomes more pronounced, as does maple, with just a hint of molasses.    Rich full body that is silky smooth and thick. World class carbonation / body balance. Effervescence is lively throughout providing perfect flavor separation yet supportive of the rich body.      The flavor profile is world class. All flavors of the nose present. Bitterness is mild. Overall, it is slightly sweet and heavily slanted to chocolate, caramel and molasses with significant maple notes. Coffee leads, yields to the sweet middle, then reemerges at the finish along with oak and vanilla. The initial mid-palate sweetness flows into maple and ebbs into the finish. Alcohol remains completely covered. The finish is a fading mixture of flavors that all seem to reemerge and leave you with a nice soft alcohol burn.

I must say I was expecting a bit more, the scent is faint, I sense some dry grain, a hint of chocolate, a whiff of the maple syrup, a tinge of the booze of the bourbon, but all these are just shadows in mist that I seemingly have to work for to ferret out, a little disappointing here, but quite honestly beer is for drinking, not shoving up my nose    taste etc...  what is this stuff ? like liquid chocolate in your mouth, viscous without losing flow, such subtle carbonation, even a little sip delivers some big flavors, you can taste all the flavors here, it starts off sweet (maple), turns bitter-ish (chocolate mixed with coffee), definite vanilla and booze finish (bourbon), the alcohol is sensed but is blended right into the fabric of the beer perfectly, like bourbon, it wants you to sense the booze, that is part of the experience, and the experience is here, after a long pause I so get a whiskey finish without the alcohol burn... damn, this stuff is good.    verdict?  $22 a bottle is pretty ballsy, you better deliver, ah, but this is Founders, one of the great breweries of the past decade, and they do deliver a baby so special the stork decided to keep it all to himself.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Appearance: Deep mahogany in color, with a small, somewhat coarse, persistent tan head. Thick, irregular lacing adorns the glass walls in an unbroken circlet. Though the body is opaqu, patches of fine-beaded bubbles adorn the glass walls, beneath the surface.    Aroma: Extraordinarily rich aroma of coffee, bitter chocolate, wood, roasted malt and vanilla. Surprisingly, there is no note of alcohol in the aroma.     Taste: Profound flavors of bitter cocoa and lesser coffee open the taste. Soon after, there is a wave of mildly sweet chocolate, not at all excessive, more of an intimation than a distinct presence. There is a mild hint of warming alcohol, although this is restrained. Surprisingly, the rather high ABV of 11.6% presents only subtly in the taste. The maple is present throughout as an undercurrent, subtle at the start, rising toward the finish. Then, too, bourbon notes, are a constancy, and offer their own stellar contribution. Finishes with powerful notes of wood, bourbon, bitter cocoa, and vanilla.    Mouth feel: Very full, thick, and gracious, with the slightest hint of carbonation.    Drinkability/notes: An extraordinary example, which, at least for me, was worthy of all the hype, and the price, $23.99 plus tax. Worthy of every craft beer connoisseur's bucket list.    Presentation: Packaged in a standard twenty-two ounce brown glass bomber, with a pry-off crown, served in a Samuel Adams Boston Lager sensory glass. The example reviewed was the 2018 release, with the "missing horseman".

This beer is fantastic for major beer advocates as well as for people who normally hate the style.    I'll say that several people who normally hate barrel-aged stouts loved this. It really is world-class.     I'm particularly impressed to say that it is really well-balanced in its sweetness and not cloying in any way.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Got it when it seemed exciting and hit the shelves. Held it a bit and noticed it hung on the shelves a while which enabled me to temper my expectations. It was really enjoyable but definitely seems a bit overrated. There was a lot of additional sweetness but I couldn't find a real strong maple flavor. Just small hints when it first hit the tongue with all the sweetness. Still incredibly enjoyable just not quite at the level I had anticipated.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Pours a very dark brown color (it isn't quite pitch-black). The head is about half a finger high and tan in shade. I'm impressed with how well the (short) head retains itself, though it fails to leave much lace on the glass.    Bam. The aroma is pure chocolate and coffee heaven. It definitely evokes Founders' standard Breakfast Stout a lot better than KBS does. But of course, I'd be remiss to ignore the barrel presence. And said barrel presence is actually pretty subtle - it doesn't run roughshod over the base, but it still offers pleasant notes of coconut, vanilla, oak, and (OF COURSE!) maple syrup. This isn't a maple syrup bomb...in fact, I'd like a bit more to come through. That's my only nitpick of an otherwise amazing nose.     On the palate, waves of maple syrup, caramel, and brown sugar flavor hits right at the tip and sides of the tongue. The middle sees more of a dark chocolate and coconut quality, while it finishes with plenty of coffee and a bit of oak presence. Ultimately, the maple isn't quite as dominant or vivid as I hoped for, but at least this allows the other elements to shine. But that isn't the major problem I have here. Simply put, this one is just too sweet. It's an impressive drink for about 6 ounces and then grows tiring after that. Still, it's never obnoxious or undrinkable, just too muddled, too unbalanced, and too sugary to taste great.     Big, bulky, viscous, and full-bodied - exactly what I expected from this beast. The barrel presence dries it out post-swallow slightly...just slightly, though. It's massively sweet in both the general feel and residual finish, and makes no bones about being a slow, steady sipper. Carbonation is low.    Y'know, I like this. I really do. But for $25 a bottle (those maple syrup barrels are expensive), I expect it to improve on Founders' other imperial stouts...or be every bit as good. And hell, the aroma set itself up to be the massive stunner I hoped for - then I tasted it. I'm extremely disappointed to say that it doesn't quite move me like vanilla Breakfast Stout, KBS, or the Imperial Stout do. Suffice to say, it fails to live up to the massive hype it generated. I wouldn't buy this again, but I'll gladly drink it again if it's offered to me.    3.87/5: Don't meet your childhood heroes...err, make that mounties

S: chocolate loaded stout. Awesome high quality medium bodied coffee grounds. Delicious smelling all around, but a little more mild than I might have expected.  T: Awesome coffee. Great dark chocolate. Not too sweet. Perfectly balanced alcohol content. This one is WAY to easy. Phenomenal control over the flavors here.    F: Completely balanaced. The coffee notes up front open you up and they counter a light touch if maple sweetness. It washes even across the palatte and then leaves a crisp clean finish that allows for an easy and immediate return for more. The alcohol is fantastically held and yet still perfectly findable within this. Love it.    O:. Really really great. Straight forward and obvious and completely awesome. Nobody else has quite mastered the balanacing act that this beer pulls off. World class good stuff.

The sweetness of the maple doesn't overwhelm, adds to the coffee flavors. Fun beer to sip over a long period of time and taste the flavors developing.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Approaching my 12-year anniversary on BA, so it's funny to finally get my hands on a bottle of CBS after wanting a taste of this beer since 2006 when I became involved in the burgeoning craft beer scene and BA website. And fitting now, after thousands and thousands of dollars spent on this "hobby," that I spend $27 on a 750ml bottle. Wish I could have shared it with someone, but alas, this will be used to distract from the stress involving a very important, life-altering result, potentially this week. Dated 10.08(?).18 with an 11.6% ABV; regardless, it's the 2018 release, surprisingly discovered in mid-November at one of my few go-to beer spots in Jacksonville, FL. Though it makes sense because Florida is a big market for Midwest beer now.    A stout cannot look better. Simple as that. Even my roommate, a Miller Lite drinking Alabaman, asked how a beer can be so dark. Aroma is massive barrel, wood, earth, booze, char, smoke, and molasses. You get some 'Grade B' dark/robust maple syrup if you really inhale. Flavor is similar, though a bit sweeter after all is said and done. The coffee and chocolate really show up when you let the beer breathe and come to room temperature. So complex, so flavorful, so intense! I really wish I could have aged this for a while to allow some of the booze and intensity to mellow out, but I justified it by telling myself it was already aged before being bottled. And the situation called for this beer to be consumed the same day I bought it. As smooth, viscous, and rich as a beer can be. This is serious stuff. Finishes strong with an incredible body and feel. Yeah, it's boozy, but I expected that. The hype is real. Simply stellar.    I haven't analyzed a beer this thoroughly, over such a long period, with so many inhales/short sips. Borderline nerd territory, which I had gotten away from for a while. But this is a special beer, which calls for a unique approach. Even as "fresh" as it is, this is a masterpiece. A 'pièce de résistance' beer; their magnum opus; the crown jewel of Imperial Stouts. One that truly defines the craft and the industry. And one of the few beers I'd want to drink before (potentially) closing out my experience as a beer snob.    Question, though...what happened to the Canadian Mountie on the label?? Looks like he was knocked off the saddle!

At first I got worried that I accidentally reached for the old jug of used engine oil I forgot to return to autozone. Thick, black and viscous. Poured a fine head with some big bubbles. Some spotty lace in the glass.  S: The nose to me is really nutty. Reminds me of a peanut butter, walnuts, ect. Its hard to miss the hints of wood/boubon. Very sweet, maple is certainly prominent, also get lots of chocolate syrup. Some hints of dark fruits as well. Overall the aroma is really inviting and delicious.   T: This is perfect for me. I really don't like handing out fives but this does it for me. Incredibly rich but balanced. I don't feel overwhelmed. Up front its creamy, a lactose sweetness. After this come the dark sugars. Some burnt notes, black coffee, well-done toast, ect. These play with more sweet notes, the maple syrup is prominent, Sweet chocolate or chocolate milk also come to mind. What's great flavor wise is the balance, there is certainly astringency and dryness but the sweetness balances it and makes it drinkable. No detectable alcohol, at least not overtly.   F: Certainly a fuller body, also definitely heavy but not like drinking sludge. Its quite easy to drink actually, which is dangerous given the ABV. Carbonation is apparent but pretty subdued by the body. Sticks to the mouth for sure. Astringency is observable but not a burden.  O: Reminds me a drinking breakfast, as you'd expect. Summarized as: like drinking boozy chocolate pancakes drenched in some of that great New England maple syrup (the real stuff!). My only qualm is the price, but you pay for quality and you certainly get it here.

Like the original, but with a maple-hinted backbone, light coffee notes. Sweetness is so well-balanced with the rest. Sticky stuff. Really like a breakfast stout (KY) with sweet pancakes and coffee in a beer. The syrup taste isn’t overpowering, but the feel is so full. Very similar to KBS, but this I like a bit more, as KBS seems lackluster ever since my first impression of it roughly 5 years ago. This would probably age well, but I don’t feel like hunting it down and paying the premium. Actually I found it’s readily available in bombers but at $24 per bottle as I’m told, I’m torn on whether I’ll bite. Once is good enough. There’s lots out there now, but it’s nice to finally check a new rarity off the list.

Since I know there is maple in it-sure it's there with vanilla extract and welcomed. Taste of a near perfect blend of maple, chocolate, dark roast coffee and vanilla. As it warms the sweeter it gets. Nothing remotely bitter. Smooth as all get out. Feel is lighter than most bourbon coffee stouts but nonetheless works well. Overall I like the lighter feel of such a welll developed stout. By the way, goes sinful with fresh powdered donuts. Outstanding!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Awesome deep, dark color. Aromas are bold with all of the mentioned ingredients with the emphasis on heavy malts and coffee. Taste is fairly well balanced with bitter chocolate, roasty coffee and just enough maple not to be too sweet. This was a 2017 and I am sure the maple has diminished somewhat and that is not a bad thing. ABV is a player from the start and continues to the end, pushing the limits but not quite hitting the top. Mouthfeel is thick and coating and the alcohol singe and bitter chocolate become more of a player as the beer warms even more. Finish is slightly bitter full of coffee and leaves with just a touch of maple. I was way too hyped to try this one and I feel the hype let me down just a tad.

Vanilla and oak with a slightly boozy bourbon backing, check. Coffee, check. I love a bit of sweetness and that's there too thanks to the maple. Looks dark as night with a thick brown head. That fades into a nice bubbly ring. Smells awesome with chocolate coffee and bourbon. Taste is the same with a sweetness that balances the bourbon bite. Feel is full and smooth, but enough carbonation to clean up the taste buds. Overall, worth the hype (and the price). Fantastic all around.

Black with a big frothy head which lasts several minutes down to a bubbly patch and leaves a frothy lacing. Looks pretty thick.  S. Dark roasted malts with coffee and cocoa, not too sweet smelling until it warms up a little with vanilla, caramel, and maple.  T. Sweet dark chocolate with coffee, sweet vanilla, big smooth caramel flavor reminiscent of bourbon, creamy mocha, and then there is a nice maple which hangs on into the finish. All the flavors are there way in the end. With each sip I seem to get more maple flavor throughout.   F. Not thick but so rich and smooth, just a bit of carbonation. Not boozy.  O. The flavors in this are big, balanced, and compliment each other nicely. Coffee, maple, vanilla, chocolate, caramel, bourbon, roasted malts. And I have to say, for me, this beer more than lives up to the hype. Cheers!

The chocolate milk foam is sudsy up top, yet silky below. It rises to an easy two fingers and, although it settles to a crown, leaves near sheet lacing in its wake. This is what a big, boozy stout should look like. Heavy, rich, decadent.    The nose is well balanced considering the melange of ingredients. Chocolate covered coffee beans kick things off. It's a little peppery boozy but that booze is fairly clean. Dark berries and a soft edge roastiness round it out. The nose is rather subdued and I don't get any maple although the oak is present. The coffee and chocolate are nicely done though.     The flavor is much more expressive than the nose. Dark chocolate gets it started with a dense, potent, softly bitter quality. It segues seamlessly into milk chocolate covered coffee beans in the middle. Macerated dark berries bring a touch of fruit before slipping into a moderately roasty bitterness on the finish. There's a little residual sweetness that verges on maple but I wouldn't call this a maple bomb by any means, which is good. A little peppery booze brings added depth while oak flirts.    The feel is likely the best aspect of this beer. It's plush but not sticky. It's slick and coating but bitter enough to slice through. A little booziness creeps up through the nose and leaves a drying sensation throughout. This one goes down dangerously easy for such a monster.    CBS is good beer. It's well rounded and complex with an excellent body. With that said, I prefer KBS to this one. The price point is a tough one to swallow as well.

The mouthfeel is smooth, carbonation is low. Overall, it’s a good one.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Amazing. This beer was always on my wishlist but didn’t know if Founders would ever release it again. Then 11/1 came and not only did I pick up a couple of bottles, I got to try both the 2018 and 2017 vintages on tap at Founders.     2018:    look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5    Beautiful dark black color with a little tan head and nice spotty lingering lacing. Would have given it more than 4/5 if only there were more sheets of lacing. Smells nice, deep roast coffee and chocolate with maybe a hint of maple - needed more aromas to score higher. But the taste and feel blew me away. Deep, rich dark roast coffee and dark chocolate, well-balanced malt backbone, caramel and vanilla notes. Then there’s the wood, bourbon and glorious maple - all present in the forefront but not overpowering the stout feel of the beer. Faint notes of molasses and brown sugar. Luscious, creamy and silky smooth, great mouthfeel - really some of the best I’ve ever felt. Just the right amount of mild carbonation. As the beer warmed it smoothed out a little and the flavors mixed so well. I can’t wait to see what happens when this beer ages for 6-12 months. I don’t understand how they did it, but the high ABV and alcohol flavor is so subtle that this beer goes down dangerously easy. Usually these high ABV imperials are sippers - but not this CBS. Absolutely fantastic beer that lives up to its hype and ridiculously high expectations.    2017:  Tried this one on tap after the newer 2018 version above. Oh man does the extra year of aging make a difference. Abundant sheets of lingering lacing that stays forever, nice mild head. So impressive. Better aromas of maple, bourbon and wood. Similar flavors but more mellow, better mixture, with softer and rounder notes. Slightly creamier and stickier mouthfeel that just coats the palate. Less warming alcohol and even easier to drink despite high ABV. I’ve never had a beer like this one.

Out of the bottle it pours a beautifully dark brew with an appealing tan head and a shade of lacing. The smell is deliciously boozy, mouthwateringly so. At this point I get some more out of the bottle to notice a carbonated beverage with creamy texture, full-bodied through-and-through. The experience is truly one to be had with this - chocolate notes with roasted coffee, and all of it blended really well with the barrel aged booze. This was everything I thought it would be, not necessarily more but definitely at minimum.

Not much bourbon flavor, and not much woodiness, but there is a hint of vanilla. Has a bit of a cola flavor cold out of the fridge, but that disappears as it warms up. Not at all boozy. Smooth and full with low carbonation.     Overall, it's flavors compliment one another, and nothing overpowers.    A very fine stout, but I wouldn't pay the price again.

I finally got the opportunity to get this beer. I first got this when it was released earlier this year. It is 50 degrees and served in a tulip glass. A medium-hard pour produced a one finger head with excellent retention. The head is a dark brown and left lacing on the glass as it dissipated. The color of the beer is SRM 37 a dark brown nearing black. The clarity of the beer is opaque.     The aromas in the beer are dark roasted malt, molasses, maple, citrus, vanilla, dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, earthy, wood, yeast, and bready.     The flavors in the beer are bourbon, dark roasted malt, molasses, maple, citrus, dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, earthy, wood, yeast, burnt sugar, and bready.     The mouthfeel of the beer is flavorful and chewy.     The body of the beer is full, low carbonation, and a full finish.     The reason I love stouts is this beer right here. The beer has the perfect harmony and balance. Full flavors and sits on the palate perfectly. I love this beer and wish I had more.

Jet with tan film; cigars, leather + burnt sugar with mulch, black grape + ash; ganache, purple Fruit Pastilles, sweet licorice, a meaty middle, then intense woody maple with a firm roasty end; big + dead smooth.     4 4.5 4.5 4.25 4.25    Serious nose - deep notes like tobacco. The miracle here is how it gets the flavors of so many sweet things - licorice, maple, chocolate - without actually being sugary. Cuts the boozy burn of KBS, though it stops short of being a better beer.     Lervig Maple wins as far as straight up maple character. And this does go a bit candy as it warms; I find myself wishing for more roast. Ultimately needs some taming: doesn’t cloy exactly but missing that bit of balance.     Still, overall, a class act.    2nd taste, bottle: wood + leather come out more; a ton of maple hard candy cut by the heat.

A drop of espresso adds complexity.     Silky smooth and medium to heavy in body with a noticeable bouron finish. Fabulously sweet and never cloying. This is the smoothest beer of this magnitude that I can remember tasting.     This is one beer that is all that it is cracked up to be.

This hits its stride at just below room temperature, when all of the aromas and flavors seem to snap into balance. Bourbon is prominent as expected. Big aromas and flavors of chocolate, coffee, and black cherry, with notes of maple peeking through as the beer warms. There is a touch of espresso-bean bitterness that is balanced by a subtle underlying sweetness. This is a big beer, to be sure, but there's nothing over the top about it. Everything integrates perfectly. Well worth the expense.

The flavor is rich and full, with multiple layers. The open is roasted malts and powerful vanilla and bourbon hits, followed by a more pungent sweetness with maple elements. Coffee and semisweet chocolate notes come in with acidity and a mild bitterness in the finish that is just enough to prevent this heavy duty stout to avoid overpowering my palate. As it warms, dark fruit and dark chocolate come forward, while maple lingers on the tail end.    M - Decent but mild carbonation. The feel is sticky and full, an expected weight, with a warmth from its nearly 12% ABV, and just enough dryness in the close when coupled with the carbonation to scrub the tongue free and open it up for more.    O - I'd given up chasing this one, but I got the chance to pick up a bottle last fall, and I am certainly happy I did. It is a style that I drink only on occasion, but delicious and rich, with great depth.

Fits the style of an American Double/Imperial Stout. Tastes of roasted malt, strong sweet malt, alcohol, liquor, coffee, and wood. Overall, great blend, strong body, good appearance, nice warmth.

Taste echoes the aroma, fairly boozy, with some roasted acidity and sweetness to back it up.    Full, smooth body has some residual sweetness with a drying finish.    Nice dessert after French toast

Much as KBS this pours a thick black with reddish brown head. Aroma is wonderful milk chocolate, sweet maple, smooth sweet coffee, vanilla. Taste is rich caramel malt, chocolate and coffee, a, delicious maple/brown sugar, on bourbon backing. Sweet but not overpowering. Thick smooth mouthfeel - sweetness lingers - maple and coffee. Just fantastic.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 I guess Founders is quite new to Alberta, so I was stoked to find this in my local shop. Certainly seems to have a great deal of hype surrounding it. Let's see if it sends me to beer heaven.    355 bottle with the Canadian mounted police label. 2017 release.    Pours into my tulip glass a severely dark colour, with a great looking fine-bubbled mocha head which sticks around as a good foam-top. Great, full sheets of lacing, and that head has retention, man. Looks stellar.    First whiff reveals raisins and hot chocolate. Definitely some vanilla and maple in there. Dusty malts, burnt toast, figs/prunes and lots of licorice. It's nice. I admit I was expecting a little more. The usual dark fruit/chocolate/vanilla aromas are here, and they're all very nice, I guess I was just expecting something transcendent. The perils of reading reviews before you try a beer yourself, I guess. I mean, it's a fantastic smelling beer, but I've definitely smelt its equal, and some have been better. Lots of vanilla and raisins now, as the beer breathes a bit in my glass. Like spiced hot chocolate.    Taste is better than the aroma, imo. Mouthfeel is full and creamy like hell. Absolutely glides over the tongue in an oily slick fashion. Beautiful. Chocolate/licorice/raisins predominate, along with plenty of lactic qualities. It's sweet with that maple but not overmuch--in fact is had a medium-dry finish and the sugar doesn't feel cloying. Nice. Plenty of woody vanilla aftertaste, and very little alcohol in the finish, making this a dangerous beast to be sure. This warms the insides very quickly.     Ok, this is good. The aroma had me a little tentative, but the taste and mouthfeel made up for it. Indeed a pretty solid imperial stout. I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, but it definitely reaches that top tier.

Riddle me that.    This beer pours a solid black abyss, with the scantest of amber basal edges, and four fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and bubbly brown head, which leaves some stellar random cobwebbed lace around the glass as it slowly sinks away.    It smells of rich medium chocolate, maple sugar cookies, a subtle Bourbon oakiness, thick cafe-au-lait, some weak toasted graininess, and very tame earthy, musty, and floral green hop bitters. The taste is bready and doughy caramel malt, bittersweet cocoa pudding, maple-vanilla cream doughnuts, ephemeral day-old coffee, a still kind of sneaky American whiskey woodiness, some mild free-range char, and an ephemeral earthy, herbal, and floral hoppiness.    The carbonation is pretty low-key in its comatose-seeming frothiness, the body a tenable heavyweight, and actually quite smooth, with a slick creaminess slowly evolving as we move along here. It finishes sweet, the malt, chocolate, and maple/vanilla all coming along for the lingering ride.    Overall - yup, this is indeed a well-constructed brew, and I always appreciate not getting smacked across the palate with the wood. The sugary flavours meld very nicely, and the 11.71 points of the ol' wowee sauce are equally and expertly integrated. Great stuff!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 2017 edition. Bottle. I’m not sure why, but today just fet like the right day to do this. By myself. There’s no way for this beer to live up to the hype at this point, and it seems like most people have been disappointed, but I think I’m into this. Actually, I’m getting more into it with every sip. It’s incredibly drinkable for the ABV - which means I’m probably going to be a little drunk very soon. The bitterness from the coffee - maybe the whiskey, but I think it’s the coffee - was a bit much at first, but the maple is really showing up as it warms, so it’s pretty damn balanced. I guess it’s not as thicc as we want it to be - I drank DBR yesterday, which was basically chocolate sauce - but if Jackie O’s could figure out how to get this kind of body into their BA brews, the beer world would collectively cream. So I don’t think I want this to be sludge because I wouldn’t want to drink a whole 750 of it. I don’t like the idea of labeling something as “perfect,” because there’s usually something that could improve even a little bit, but this is close.

Price: $23.99  Purchased: May 4, 2018  Consumed: May 25, 2018  Reviewed as: American Double / Imperial Stout  Misc.: 2017 release (no bottled on date); #CraftAdjace    Saw cases of this at Jubilation Wine & Spirts in Albuquerque, N.M. Was excited because the allotment in San Diego sold out on the first day I believe and here there were loads and loads of it. Wasn’t happy with the $23.99 price tag, but it was at 750-ml. bottle and I reasoned with myself that it wasn’t available since Oct. 2011. Also from the same article saw that it was retailing for $24.99, so I guess I got a deal. Online description read, “Canadian Breakfast Stout (CBS) is the epitome of why we launched the Backstage Series: to bring some of our most sought-after beers, which have been available primarily at the taproom or at a few select events, to a much larger audience. Canadian Breakfast Stout is an Imperial Stout brewed with a blend of coffees and imported chocolates, then aged in spent bourbon barrels that have most recently been aging pure Michigan maple syrup.” DAMN!    Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of khaki tan rocky head. Serene setting underneath with no noticeable bubbles. Almost perfect spiderweb foamy lacing. World-class retention. (Sight - 4.75)    Smelled smooth bourbon, char wood, making it smokier than I would have thought, dark candied chocolate, cacao, oak, toffee, black burnt coffee grinds, light vanilla cream and maple syrup at the very end when I pulled away. Got straight maple from the bottle. Wow. What a difference from the glass that it was poured in and the bottle. (Smell - 4.25)    Took a few sips to really appreciate it. In order got oaky bourbon, char wood, candied dark chocolate, cacao, espresso, burnt coffee grinds, lingering maple syrup, burnt brown sugar, vanilla cream, lightly toasted marshmallow, licorice, toffee and roasted barley. (Taste - 4.25)    Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish, (Feel - 4.75)    Just a terrific beer. Better than KBS for sure, although I still prefer most versions of Tioga-Sequoia to Founders. Hopefully this is the last time I ever purchase/review a #CraftAdjace beer.

Three finger tight mocha head that fades to a light tan top, mocha bottom ring that persists. Nose is smooth balance of bourbon, coffee, maple, maybe some vanilla. First sips follow the nose deliciously. This is my first encounter with this legend, and a very tasty one at that. The area had a surge of availability, so I bought four! Evidently, there are lots to go around, or the hype has faded, but I'm okay with being late to the party. Mouthfeel is heavy, full, lingering perfect balance of the core flavors. Very drinkable at a fast pace, but at $25 a bomber, savor that flavor! Lacing is still clinging to glass top some 20 minutes later. The aftertaste is sweet maple with a vanilla presence. In some ways, the front end reminds me of Prairie Paradise, which I was fortunate to score in my area recently, because some beer connoisseurs tucked away a handful. The sweetness was never cloying, unlike some "dessert" beers, but was balancing the dark roasted coffee and bourbon flavors. I didn't really get any prominent chocolate notes on nose or tongue. Does wanting only great beer like this make me a snob? I'm okay with that. I'll keep advocating (see what I did there?) for my friends to put down those sad, pale glasses of swill!    2018 version update. I don’t know why, but there are lots around again. Score! Poured cellar temp, moderately to a tulip glass. Dark brown, possibly black. Head is much darker than last year’s, smaller, and fades faster. Nose is sweet dark fruit, maybe a hint of maple, but no evidence of what one might expect like coffee, bourbon, vanilla. First sips are sweet, slightest roasted coffee, not getting any bourbon. Still very balanced, but the sweetness takes a fraction more focus. Mouthfeel is medium, with more fullness as it warms. Some chocolate and more coffee pop in later. Alcohol bite nowhere to be found. Another solid sipper.

The taste, look and smell notes are basically the same as what others have described. I will add that the batch I tried did not have a lot of maple syrup in the nose, and the maple sweetness was extremely faint, popping up mainly at the finish.    The thing that got me with this beer was it’s body. Never had a barrel aged stout that was even close to being this smooth, especially at 12%ABV. The beer is definitely full bodied, but somehow it felt extremely light and fluffy, sort of like drinking a bourbon-maple-stout storm cloud. It was unbelievable. For such a flavorful beer there was no one taste that overpowered.     I personally feel that this beer was worth every bit of hype it’s received. Would definitely wait in a very long line for it.

Pours black with a finger of tan frothy head, smells like bourbon soaked chocolate cake, creamy sugary coffee, maple syrup, molasses, and hints of vanilla and licorice, taste is boozy burnt dark caramel crunch candy (similar to Ample Hill Creamery), sweet maple syrup, a hint of coffee and finishes with roasted coffee bitterness, this beer is nice and velvety. Not quite the RAINS OF AFRICA that I recall from when I first had this at EBF many years ago, but an excellent mocha maple syrup treat.

Lots of Bourbon and maple syrup in the nose. Coffee, chocolate syrup, roasted malts, espresso, earth, notes of leather and maybe a hint of vanilla as well. The taste isn’t as sweet as I expected. Bourbon taste is upfront but the maple syrup and sweetness from the chocolate are not over powering. Woody with cocoa and black coffee. Roasted malts, leather and earth towards the end. Woody, Bourbon finish with one last hint of maple syrup. Medium to heavy mouthfeel with low carbonation. Not quite as boozey tasting as I had expected but it does have a noticeable alcohol presence. It took me a while to get one of these but I’m glad I finally got to try it. Worth seeking out for sure.

Dark roasted malt, vanilla, smoky bourbon, sweet toasted coconut.    Taste is likewise rich and delicious. Bittersweet chocolate, fig, coconut. Subtle undertones of maple and bourbon. No hint of alcohol.    Mouthfeel is smooth and slick, full bodied. Just right.    Overall an outstanding imperial stout that lives up to the hype.

Bottled likely in November 2017 (no bottling date visible). Consumed 4-20-18.    Beer poured black as night with a very nice tan head that is leaving lacing behind-4.5.     Nose is a awesome combination of coffee, cocoa, bourbon, and maple; it is very subtle yet wonderful-4.5!    Taste is a masterful blend of coffee, chocolate, subtle maple, and a nice touch of bourbon. Initial sips were warming to let you know the bourbon was there, yet a beautiful compliment to the entire flavor profile-4.75.    Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, so velvety smooth across the palate with each sip-4.75.    Overall this brew lives up to the hype. I honestly thought i would not like it a lot because i am not big on maple but i have to say i am totally impressed-4.75! Average score 4.68.      Picked up a 750 ml bottle, no wait, from the Craft Beer Hop Stop on 11-7-18 for $23.99. Appears to be bottled on 10-9-18. Consumed on 12-7-18.    Beer poured black with a very nice tan head that had a great head initially with some jetsam hanging around-4.5.    Nose is wonderful, bourbon forward with a nose full of chocolate, maple, and vanilla - 4.75    Taste is awesome, a nice touch of bourbon up front leading to a nice warming; chocolate, maple, and vanilla meld wonderfully with the large mildly roasted malt base with a well balanced finish with the hopping - 4.75.    Mouthfeel is full, smooth, and very satisfying-4.75!    Overall i would say this is more fragrant fresher but also more of an alcohol presence with each sip. I acquired two more bottles so i will try this twice in the upcoming year to see how it ages. Awesome beer-4.75! Average score 4.74.

But I had purchased it over the holidays and wanted to share with friends, and had forgotten about it for a few months. Perhaps I should have left it shelved for longer.     Look - is very dark and thick looking pouring out into tasting cups.     Smell is very sweet, yes on the border of cloying. Maple syrup, chocolate, coffee. I thought at that point "oh no, is this like those sickly sweet holiday stouts?"    Taste is very very very sweet, I would counter and say on the wrong side of too sweet. Maple, chocolate, some hint of coffee (weak) and then hard to discern much else, but I suspect some vanilla was present to try and calm it down, but at the expense of more sweetness. Cloyingly sweet.    Mouthfeel was fine and unoffensive, but it did feel like drinking watered down syrup.     Overall, this disappointed me at the cost of $28 bottle and for a beer ranked #13 on this site. I admit I "am" some BMCer posting only my third review, and I have been swayed to the East Coast juice bomb IPAs for the last couple years, but I drink Guinness, Founders Porter, and other darks on occasion, and was expecting something more subtly balanced and much much less sweet. I may re-evaluate after exploring more stouts, but this was more like a dessert than a beer. I will say that it smelled delicious and made us all hungry for pancakes as we doused the fire with the remainder at end of night. Can't say we weren't warned, it did say "breakfast" right there on the label. Mea Culpa!

The maple syrup really shines, backed by coffee and chocolate.    Taste is massive and sweet, but again on the right side of too sweet. Maple syrup, bourbon, oak and vanilla assault your taste buds. More chocolate appear as it warms. Superb.    Mouthfeel is perfect, thick and sticky with just the right amount of carbonation.    Overall, this managed to live up to my hype. One of the best stouts I've ever had.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 10oz draft pour from Whichcraft North in Austin,TX compared side by side with a draft KBS. The KBS was so good that I didn’t think I could identify any flaws with it until I took my first sip of CBS. Both beers are incredible but I would give the edge to the CBS. The additional sweetness from the maple helps to mask any remaining alcohol flavors that survived the chocolate and coffee infusion. There is no trace of its double digit ABV. The CBS is smooth, sweet, silky, deliciousness and a must try for any BA fan.

Not much maple.    First sip carries coffee bitterness, powder cocoa and a bit of booze. Continues with faint sweetness from the syrup sugar. Bitterness fades and opens up some more semi sweet chocolate. Vanilla as it warms some with background sweetness throughout.    Medium to big bodied, more carbonation than I was expecting. Full mouth coating and long finish.    This definitely is more complex than KBS, but not as much as I expected. It is sweeter from the maple but it's much subdued by coffee and bakers chocolate bitterness. Body seems right for the ABV and the flavors hold back any real booziness.

Poured into a small chalice: color is solid black with tan head of fine bubbles, presents at least 1 inch thick and lingers really, really well. Good spotty lacing on the glass sides.     Smell is probably the most subdued aspect, even after 20-30 minutes of warming: aroma is sweet, light roast, hint of vanilla, bourbon, chocolate. Not much coffee, especially compared to base breakfast stout.     Taste is somewhat ridiculous - hard to fathom that this is a 12% abv brew, but i think the maple/bourbon barrel aging really softens the booziness. Flavor is sweeter than expected, but not cloying, good base stout with vanilla, bourbon, chocolate interplaying well. No coffee like notes. Still a beer that is too easy drinking at 12%.    Mouthfeel is where the booziness comes into play, but still not detracting from the beers character - you expect it. Feel starts sweet, with moderate/low carbonation, good presence.     Overall a great brew that hides its strength and is too easy to drink.

Comparing it to Clown Shoes Snow On the Maple Tree, which is also aged in bourbon barrels that had maple syrup previously in them, I'd give the nod to Clown Shoes. The Clown Shoes beer is also nearly half the price of CBS. Taking cost out of the equation I'd still pick Clown Shoes simply because the sweetness was balanced with the bourbon notes. If you like sweet stouts this is a good option, if you want a bit more bourbon bite it won't hit the mark.

From a 355ml bottle served chilled at 11 degrees Celsius into a TeKu glass. Best before date: 27.10.2018 – I've had the bottle since December 2017. My expectations are sky-high given the hype around this beer. I also may have had it on tap during its December release. Yup, most definitely did.    Look: The beer pours an opaque black with 4.5cm of dense, mousse-like, brown head that dissipates into a partial film within 5+ minutes. Exceptional lacing with some of the most persistent head I've seen for a near 12% ABV beer. World-class.    Smell: Medium-strong and balanced. Rich, deep, and layered. A staggering malt complexity with moderate vanilla and oak. Prominent notes of chocolate and coffee with a roasty character that surprises you every now and then. A well-hidden ethanol along with some licorice and caramel also come up. The dry nose is oaky-caramelly. For such a robust beer this shows an impressive amount of restraint. No apparent hop or yeast aroma.    Taste: Follows the aroma with strong intensity, bitter balance, and assertive perceived bitterness. Big, bold, and absolutely delicious. The gorgeous flavour opens up with chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and some bourbon. Moving towards mid-palate, notes of coffee begin to take over along with a sweetness that I assume comes from the maple syrup. Additional notes include dried fruit (prunes) along with black licorice and the faintest of ethanol right before the aftertaste settles in. The long finish is strong and bitter with lingering notes of bourbon and chocolate. Simply delish.    Feel: Full body with mild carbonation. Thick, velvety-smooth, and creamy with great chewy, viscosity. Smooth and balanced alcohol warming of moderate strength. No harshness or astringency even with the strong bitterness.    Overall: Founders Canadian Breakfast Stout is a wonderful, world-class beer featuring excellent craftsmanship and low drinkability. Robust, full of layers, and most of all balanced. It's rare to find a barrel-aged beer with such grace. I do prefer the KBS for the lack of sweetness that the maple syrup brings in. A must-try in my books.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 750ml bottle poured into a snifter.    A: Inky black with a creamy brown head. Half a finger of retention. Spotty lacing.    S: Freshly brewed pot of coffee, roasty, maple syrup, dark chocolate. Perhaps the faintest whiff of green hops. Slight oakiness, bourbon is barely perceptible if at all. Well put together. Smells like breakfast in a glass.    T: Fresh coffee, maple syrup, dark and semi-sweet chocolates. Plenty of malt roast and caramel. The barrel itself is rather subdued, with a faint corny-sweet bourbon flavor and warmth and a dab of oak. It manifests itself a bit more into the finish, where just a bit of char is evident as well.     M: Rich, thick, and sticky. Very chewy. Carbonation is apparent, but has a soft touch. Creamy and decadent.     O: Damn good stuff. Strikes a perfect balance. Coffee, chocolate, and maple syrup meld perfectly with the base beer. The syrup flavors are 90% of what the barrel has to offer, though there are some bourbon and oak subtleties too. It is big and sticky in texture and feel, but as far as the alcohol goes only a faint warmth belies its strength. It's easy to see why this became such a coveted beer.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I had this beer a few days ago and I had to sit on it for a while before giving it's score. This beer is absolutely fantastic through and through. Wonderful dark dark brown with an almost chocolate colored head savory head. Powerfully strong aromas of chocolate, dark fruit, roasted Carmel, vanilla, sugar can, brown sugar, roasted nuts, roasted oats, chocolate, coffee, toffee and of course, lots and lots of maple. The flavor is pretty much the same. It tastes as powerful as it smells and it is truly delicious. The mouthfeel is very juicy and rewarding as well. But I have one problem with this beer. It seems to try and stand on its own, but in reality it is literally KBS with maple. I understand how well crafted and special this beer is, but without the maple it is KBS. With that being said, this beer's maple flavor isn't exactly a step forward in the breakfast stout from founders. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it doesn't have a quality that makes it better than KBS. I really love the maple flavor in this beer, but in reality, KBS is better because it doesn't have that maple flavor.    Again, great beer that is extremely well crafted and delicious. But it's just KBS with the flavor of Maple. I understand the hype and I would try it if I were you, but the similarity is just too close and KBS did it before so it's the better beer to me.

Good lacing.   Right off the bat it's big sweet notes of barrel and coffee and chocolate. Vanilla and oak. Black coffee. Almost a cinnamon-spicy element that's probably more barrel, but gave a spice hint for a second. I'm not really getting any maple, but my sniffer is notoriously weak, so *shrug*  Oh man...  First thought: this is a damn good beer. Second thought: this is a damn sweet beer. Third thought: but this is a damn good beer!  Sugar maple is the first thing that makes its presence known. I know I said I didn't smell it, but it is absolutely there in the taste and it is delicious. I love maple, though. As it warms, the maple moves from the big splash at the first impression to more of the build and a supportive role.   OK. So sweet maple, like the crust that builds at the lip of your jug of maple syrup. That's what the first impressions are. In support of this sweet crust is a balance of acrid black coffee and rich hints of dark chocolate and char. The vanilla and oak of the barrel gets folded in as the grout between the sweet maple syrup and richness of the dark chocolate.   Finish leans more heavily into the fudgy rich chocolate before lingering with a bitter dark chocolate finish.  Body could stand to be a touch heftier, per my personal preference (I admit I'm a sucker for those stouts that are like used motor oil). Fine pinpricks of carbonation help usher the tongue along between the various notes listed above. I'm not surprised that it is 11.7% ABV per se, but it is very well folded in with the rest of the brew and does not taste 'hot' like many big big stouts like this can.    This is a beer with an incredible reputation, and I'm glad to finally confirm it for myself.   Much much love to @FlintB for sending this along for NBS BIF#007. This was one of the first beers that I listed after that I couldn't get locally, and here almost seven years later I'm finally getting to try it thanks to Brian's generosity. I think it's likely to stay as a permawant.

The taste also starts with strong coffee, then malt, chocolate, vanilla, maple, some bourbon. Smooth, a solid full, well carbonated.    Way more coffee than I expected, a little less bourbon, too. The chocolate also stands out, the maple is solid, and even if less than I thought, the bourbon sneaks up on you. Certainly a great beer.

Finally opened up a balmer of this one after (3) months purchased - a recommendation from local brewpub. This is comparable to Weyerbacher Sunday Morning Stout; just , not as boozy (taste & in ABV @ 12.7%).

Spotted about 15 of this beer on the shelves, so I had to swoop in. The 750ml bottle set me back $24.95. Diving into it today, a sunny, cold, lazy winters day (18MAR18).    Poured about half into a small snifter to start... It is an oily, dense, black brew, with a fine, creamy but thin beige head. Lacing is pretty decent, overall. The aroma is rich with dark choco, mocha, some maple and a hint of coffee. The feel is easily medium-plus, bordering on being full and chewy. And it is smooth and silky all the way across the tongue.     Flavor has a lovely mix of various items... There's dark choco, but it's rather sweet and not bitter at all. Then some mocha and cocoa, plus subtle coffee notes. Sweet maple syrup action lingers lovingly on the palate, along with some bourbon lurking in the background. Being such a chocolaty malt bomb, the hopping is rather light and barely noticeable. This one is going down quite easily, and my innards can feel the warmth . Not sure I'd shell out that kind of coin again, but I'm glad I was able to get to try this one.... I think I picked a good one for my 2000th BA review...

Pours black with a thick 1 inch medium brown head    Nose: phenomenal mix of coffee, maple, and bourbon. Noticeably sweeter than KBS, but also more complex with the added maple component. Overall great balance and depth.    Taste: follows the nose. Equal parts maple, coffee, and bourbon. The maple really stands out in a direct comparison with KBS and the coffee in CBS is less prominent (not muted by any extent, there are just more competing elements). Again noticeably sweeter than KBS, but never becomes cloying.     Mouthfeel is silky smooth and extraordinarily drinkable. Feels a bit more full-bodied than KBS.

"CBS Imperial Stout"  $10.50/10.5 oz. on tap @ Union Tap House, Philadelphia, PA on 9 February 2018    Notes: Very dark brown-black body beneath a creamy head of brown. The head retention is very good and the lacing is even better. The aroma suggests chocolate, cocoa beans, toffee, oak, vanilla, Bourbon, coffee, and maple syrup. The taste follows, with stronger notes of maple syrup, caramel, Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, a charred roastiness, and coffee beans. It's sweet and just moderately bitter but also balanced by a touch of alcohol and acidity. Medium-full in body and smooth and oily with a moderate, very fine-bubbled carbonation.

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Black color with a modest brown head. Aromas start with the bourbon, though it is fairly subdued, at least in comparison with her sister KBS. There are clear maple aromas, but again not so strong. Mellow aromas of maple and red soft fruits. Plum, cocoa aromas are apparent, also coffee but again little less than KBS. Taste is a nice mix by sweet and bitter. The vanilla and maple provide a mellowness that balance out any original bitterness of the KBS, so the beer is more balanced and less rough. The body is full, there's a distinct alcohol warmness. The texture is a bit creamy, more so than KBS, thanx to the impact of the maple and vanilla from the oak barrels and the maple syrup. A great beer but I prefer the KBS's strongness than this wonderful "soft" maple syrup version.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Received in a Ninja box from @Dragginballs76 – Thanks Michael!  Undated 750 mL capped bottle, stored at 42 degrees and served at 58 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.  Appearance – 4.25  Body – Dark brown/black, opaque. Effervescent.  Head – Large (Maximum 4.5 cm, aggressive center pour), khaki, medium density with a rocky top, good retention, slooowy diminishing to a very irregular three to twelve mm ring fed by effervescence and a thick and rocky partial layer. Head retraction leaves complete rings of lacing, fairly unusual for a brew that is both 11.7% ABV and barrel-aged.  Lacing – Good. The combination of the head retraction and the lowering of the beer level with consumption leaves a picturesque curtain effect.  First pour – Dark brown, clear.  Aroma – 4 - Dark chocolate, light roasted malt, a hint of coffee, no maple syrup aroma.  Flavor – 4.25 – Initial flavor is coffee followed by a bit of chocolate. Maple ghosts by on the aftertaste. Alcohol is not found in the taste, nor on the nose, nor evident by gastric warming. It was, however, evident in my mental patterns as I finished the bottle. Hops are not evident. No diacetyl and no dimethylsulfide.  Palate – 4 – Medium to full, almost creamy, soft carbonation.  Impression and summation – 4.25 – There is no argument that this is an above-average impy stout. However, IMHO, those rating it as straight “5”s across the board need to re-examine every impy stout they have ever reviewed. The aroma is not extremely above average – I wasn’t transported to Dream Lands by the wafting perfumes of ambrosia. The palate is not excessively better than most impy stouts. The appearance was only slightly unusual in that good lacing remained considering the ABV and the barrel-aging factor. The flavor, while good, did not transport me to Paradise, not even by the dashboard lights. I’m certainly glad that I tried it but still, it’s much like buying a unicorn and finding out it’s only a mutated goat.

This beer pours a beautiful deep dark brown with a legitimate dark tan head. The aroma is a fantastic blend of coffee, chocolate and maple. The flavor follows the nose, with vanilla, caramel and oak joining the party. The feel is smooth and creamy. Overall I believe this is the best beer I've had.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Poured from a 750 bottle into a St Bernardus goblet. Vintage 2017.  4.75/4.25/4/4.5/4  A: Pours black, not too viscous, with an impressive two fingers of latte-colored foam.  S: Smells like oatmeal raisin cookies with stale cold brew and loads of sugar and a touch of dark fruit and vanilla. No booze.  T: Tastes smooth, but with a touch of fire. Most obvious are the toasted malts, which along with the sugar hints at toasted coconuts. Long endtaste is mostly dates and maple candy, but there is a touch of chocolate right at the end that forestalls any lingering cloyingness. From a beer with this much going on, I frankly expected a lot more. The taste is subdued and rather balanced, a rounder, sweeter KBS. I miss the bitterness from the FBS/KBS actually, but this is extremely well done.   M: Very fine, toeing the line between thick and spritzy. Never too heavy or too anemic. Well done.   O: Impressive, if not entirely worth scouring the planet. Virtually no trace of the 11.7%, a mellow, contemplative, after supper drink like a fortified wine.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Bottle courtesy of Toby. Dark brown with some light sneaking through. Aroma is the normal RIS aromas with hints of maple. Taste comes on a bit stronger, more of the booze, sweetness, coffee, maple.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 This beer has the same great look as its more famous brother, KBS.    The maple is distinctly present - somewhat in the nose and very potently in the flavor. The sweet maple flavor could present a nice contrast to the bitter roast but instead it somewhat detracts from the stout-like qualities of this offering. The bourbon also seems to be a bit drowned out.    I waited a long time to sample this Great White Whale. Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed.

Smells absolutely intoxicating of caramel, roasted malt and coffee, with lovely, mellow notes ouf bourbon, oak, vanilla chocolate, toffee and maple. Taste follows the nose, with a complex and incredibly well-balanced harmony of caramel, roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla and maple, with some earthy notes and a certain spicyness coming through as well. There is a slight bitterness in the aftertaste that really balances out the caramel, maple sweetness, not that it would be too pronounced in the first place. A little booze coming through as well, but it's such a lovely, mellow shade of bourbon that it doesn't feel unpleasant at all. Rich body with a thick, oily mouthfeel and low carbonation. This is without a doubt my new favorite stout, no contest. The exceptional balance is what makes this special. Nothing really stands out too much, which is a GOOD thing. Balancing a stout this complex so well is a true accomplishment.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 I have finally had the pleasure of getting ahold of this legendary and well respected brew, this winter of 2018! First time tasted at a friend’s place, 2nd time, purchased by myself, cracked open at my son’s 2nd birthday party, reviewed here.  Pours a dark mahogany and nearly black color. However, what makes the color even more special, is the hints of ruby red, that make this brew appear vinous. As it pours, a dense and creamy tan mocha heady rises to the surface, foamy and frothy. It eventually dissipates.  The aroma emits boozy sweetness, like a dessert liqueur. Although the alcohol fades somewhat, the sweetness doesn’t. It massages the olfactory with the rich sweetness of both milk and dark chocolate, and maple syrup. The roasted malt and coffee is also prevalent.  As with the aroma, the initial impression of liqueur and boozy sweetness greets the tongue like a dessert drink. Yet, it never becomes too boozy or cloying, considering the complexity of flavors. The diversity of flavors evoke dark chocolate, brown sugar, dark caramel, maple syrup, bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, and creamy sweetness. However, the mid palate offers an assertive balance of roasted, slightly charred malt, coffee and hops. The finish is just about perfect, adding the taste of espresso beans, hops, tobacco, and a lingering bitterness and dryness that makes it drinkable.  Mouthfeel is full, creamy, velvety, smooth, rich and decadent. Syrupy and with a gentle carbonation. It is a sipper, yet, easy to drink at the same time. Sweet overall with a nice balance of roasty bitterness. High on alcohol but not overwhelming; it provides a slow warming and gentle burn.  I can’t think of many more superlatives except to say it is out of this world. I enjoyed it even more than KBS. Hope to have it again next year. I hope this review did it justice.

Appearance: Black in colour with a one finger fluffy brown head that had decent retention while leaving some spotty lacing.    Aroma: Sweetish milk chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and coffee bean with hints of oak, maple and caramel.    Taste: Sweet bourbon and maple upfront with roasty coffee, chocolate, vanilla and caramel. There is light booziness on the finish.    Mouthfeel: Full to medium bodied with low carbonation.    Overall: This was an excellent sipper. There was perhaps less maple than I expected, but still just enough to make an impression with the nice bourbon flavours.

Nope. It more or less lived up to expectations.    Pours a deep dark cola brown bordering on black. My aggressive pour yielded 3 fingers of dense mocha head that receded to a thin collar. Aroma is equal parts dark chocolate, cappuccino, maple, vanilla, and hot bourbon. Taste is all that and more. Dark roast coffee with a touch of Irish cream, faint caramel notes, molasses, and oak all contribute to a harmonious array of flavors. Excellent balance between the bitter and sweet notes. Body is thick and velvety. Coats the palate well, and finishes with some nice bourbon spice.    Overall, it's up there with the best I've had. Perfect dessert beer.

Smells of bourbon, maple syrup, roasted malt, coffee, cocoa, earthy hops, and licorice. The taste follows exactly with roasted malt, maple syrup, bourbon, cocoa, coffee, earthy hops, and licorice. Great intensity and flavor depth. Perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness. No noticeable alcohol. The feel is rich and full but leaves a clean taste on your pallet. Overall, this is a world-class stout; it's balanced, complex, and rich. The maple syrup is perfect; sweet but balanced by the roasted malt and coffee.

Decent retention; swoopy lacing. (4.25)    S:  Toasty malts, toffee, licorice, coffee, baker's chocolate, bourbon vanillins. (4.5)    T:  Huge thick wave of sweet roast flavors. Really strong toffee/maple undercurrent almost caramel-like, with roast layers piled on top (following the nose). (4.5)    M:  Full body with light carbonation and a rich, decadent feel and finish with a slow warmth and smooth finish. (4.5)    O:  Lordy!  It pours a murky jet black with a solid slab of brown head on top. The aroma and flavor are both roasty as could be but on the sweeter end of the spectrum, without any char or bitterness. The maple comes through a lot more in the flavor than in the smell but it is there throughout (moreso as it warms). Exactly as advertised, also the bourbon is there but does an excellent job in a supporting role l rather than the focal point.   This is a top notch stout. Really something special. (4.75)

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Bottle Date: 2017  Palate Contaminants: other beer    The liquid is a very dark brown, only a step down from the absolute darkest I've ever seen. The head is half-way to looking like a chocolate mousse. The lacing lingers for a little while.    The smell is like a maple pecan pie with coffee-inflused whipped cream. There's also a good amount of chicory. It's slightly savory, which is not a common description for the nose. Vanilla as it warms up.    This is the ideal dessert beer. I just wish I had a cabin in the woods with a fireplace to sit next to. The pecan pie description is still apt. The maple syrup seems crossed with honey. What was chicory has turned to dark (although not bitter) chocolate. Slightly nutty beyond even the pie. Brazil nuts, specifically. Alchohol heat is present, but fairly mild. And one piece of advice: it's so intense that you lose out if you gulp it, so sip away. The sweetness is the main feature, but it's not excessive.    I was worried about it being overly thick, but the weight is moderate. The carbonation is very fine and nicely integrated. Again, the alcohol is fairly well hidden, but nobody should be slamming this one, anyway. The aftertaste is so pleasant. Brazil nuts, roasted chocolate, and lingering maple.    There's been a time or two where I ate something way too rich way too quickly. This is a brew has potential in that vein.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Dark brown body like molasses, and a solid marshmallow head like the froth of hot chocolate, super sticky retention.  Beautiful roasted coffee/chocolate aroma - very little bitterness or acidity; some oakiness.  What a flavour bomb! Delightful, silky, rich dark chocolate - like they melted a bar in it. Some caramel, dark rum, vanilla. Again, very low acidity and none of that bitter espresso flavour often encountered, the roast is perfect. Maple syrup sweetness is heavy handed, makes the beer cloying - the taste is a nice compliment, but too much of a good thing. Mouthfeel is incredibly soft, like a silk pillow. Light carbonation, full body.    If they were to dial back the maple syrup, this would be one of my favourite stouts for sure. Even as is, it's a treat and a wonderful dessert beer. But one little bottle is almost too much for one person. After the tasting, read that they actually do brew it with chocolate, explaining the purity of flavour.

Maple syrup, coffee, bourbon, dark chocolate, roasted malt, molasses, toffee, vanilla, caramel, dark fruit, plum and raisin.   Full body. Light carbonation.     MAGIC!

Light tingly carbonation on the tongue. Booze warmth going down.    The reputation is well deserved. This is outstanding. An absolute must-try.

Finally getting a chance to try it now.  A: It looks like any other bourbon barrel stout with the exception of a slight burnt caramel rim to the light lace left around the glass.   S: Candied apple, toffee, acidic Costa Rican roast, burnt maple sugar, super sweet barrel aged candied malt.  T: Follows the nose with smooth alcohol heat. All the notes are there, the main difference between this and KBS is the burnt candied sugar that is very pronounced in this beer. It’s sweet but not sickeningly sweet.   M: light to medium body with a long boozy after trail that lasts over half a minute if taken at slightly above room temperature.  O: I’m glad to have tried this beer but I’m not going out of my way to buy it again if not on draft. The ludicrous prices online are a remenent of a time way past. There are fabulous beers that can be gotten for a lot less. Firestone Parabola is one to mimic this beer if you want to find something synonymous. For my taste and money KBS beats THIS BEER hands down in complexity and longevity to smooth aging.

Thumb sized coco head in my little snifter falls slow and laces very well for a big beer. Don't get anymore stout looking then this.    Aroma is intense sweet lots free floating sugars, maple syrup, big coffee beans, chocolate. All wrapped up in bourbon barrel with dry oak and vanilla underneath. Aroma is so smooth and relaxing it all blends so well with nothing out of place it all meshes so well.    Taste is almost as great as the nose rich malts chocolate sweet sugary maple syrup, big dark roasted coffee. Bourbon barrels add just the right kick with dry oak notes and good vanilla that goes well with the sweetness. One of the more balanced Bourbon Barrels as it all blends so well sweet maple and whiskey kick with great oak notes. Even at 11.7% alcohol is not noticed other then bourbon flavors . Very nice job on this one.    Mouthfeel is about normal for a big stout full but could be chewier like a Dark Lord carbonation is smooth and well balanced.    Overall this is a fantastic beer all be it over priced, maybe due to the well deserved hype. But I payed 25$ for a bottle, for 15 I would buy a few more but at 25 eh its wonderful but then I'm not Bill Gates.

The beers aromas are intense - leaden by sugar coated espresso beans and a maple peak. Spicy bourbon is there as well, adding a pleasant depth, consisting of earth, oak, toffee and marzipan. Everything is very well balanced, without any ingredient standing out in particular, creating a very well working nose.    Has a thicker, very soft mouthfeel, with almost no carbonation, leaving a long lasting whipped cream impression on the palate, showcasing the heavier body of the beer perfectly well.    Tastes of toffee, on which the roasted, earthen coffee settles, which then unfolds on the palate with a plethora of sweet, wooden and dryer flavors. Both maple and the barrel add to this initial impression in the best possible fashion, lending an almost chewy, rich and oaken, spice quality. After the swallow, coffee turns drier, maple lingers on and a prominent roasted maltiness rushes over more subtle vanilla.     This is great, because it simply relies on its balance. By doing so, the beers complex flavors are able to unfold perfectly, enriching each other the whole time.

It was black with a seriously sticky dark tan head and lacing.     The smell is of roasted malts, dark fruit and bourbon. The aroma is intense and inviting.    The taste tracked the smell, lots of heavily roasted, almost charred malts. There are raisins, toffee, a bit of vanilla all backed by some pretty serious bourbon notes. It keeps reveling other characteristics as it opens-up and warms. Some woody notes and more bourbon late. It is never to “hot”.     The mouth is silky and coating. It is a perfect night cap.

The nose is rich with coffee flavor, some chocolate, and there's a hint of sweetness to it.   Taste - is quite interesting. Up front is is rich with coffee. Then it changes over to a chocolate flavor. On the back side it gets some sweetness. Really a rich, complex flavor profile. There's also a bit of a barrel flavor in this beer, but it isn't overwhelming at all.   Feel - Full bodied. Barrel feel. Rich, and thick.   This is a world class beer, and I'm glad I got to try it. I highly recommend it.   
look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Expected color, quarter-inch of a creamy tan head, mild carbonation. I didn't find the aroma to be particularly robust - coffee is the predominant note but even that is rather light. Underneath is a little maple syrup sweetness, but missing any barrel or classic stout smells.     I felt very similar to the taste, though flipped from the aroma: the maple syrup is all over this beer, to the point of almost drowning the other flavors. The coffee does poke its head out of the water here & there, there is a vague, muted milk chocolate. Bourbon feels like it wants to make a show, but ultimately doesn't, just whispers now & then. What lingers is that maple sweetness, and while that is all well & good, I just found the beer to lack depth & balance between the various components. Mouthfeel is very thick & viscous, stays on the tongue for awhile.

look: 4.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Founders CBS (2017)    A: The second (official) bottling of this (in)famous beer pours completely black and utterly opaque, seeming to suck the light out of everything around it with the intensity of its blackness. An espresso crema head of about a finger forms upon an aggressive pour. Retention is good. Lacing is very good. Viscosity appears very high, thick and sticky. Alcohol legs are no surprise at 11.7%. This is a great-looking American imperial stout. 4.75/5    A: Coffee and chocolate dominate the nose to the point of completely hiding the base stout, and, even more surprisingly, obscuring the usually assertive aromas of maple syrup, bourbon, and oak barrel. In true Founders fashion, the coffee is a very deep and dark component more in the vein of an old school French or Italian roastiness than the fruitier, more complex third wave roasts. The chocolate smells rich and sweet, more milk chocolate than dark or baker's, and it is a far cry from cacao nibs. What is there of the maple is more of a sweetish earthiness than the unctuous liquid usually found on pancakes. The base beer contributes some more readiness and a vaguely creamy notion, probably attributable to the oats, but it really only seems to serve as a field for the additives to play on. The barrel is nearly impossible to find either in oak or bourbon; maybe there is some sweet vanilla toward the back end, but it is a reach. This seems to be a rather simplistic dessert showcase.On the plus side, the alcohol is nowhere to be found on the nose. 3.75/5    T: Aha, there is the maple! It runs a beautifully rich undercurrent of sweet, rustic earth through every sip, playing beautifully off of the moderately heavy coffee roast and sweet chocolate, which still remain the primary flavors. The base beer contributes a little umami and a ton of earthy hop flavors and bitterness; these hops get along wonderfully with thr maple. Finally, the bourbon barrel comes around in a big way with some savory spiciness, oaky tannins, bitter vanilla, and a little alcohol sweetness. The overall impression is something like buckwheat pancakes with too many chocolate chips and dark chocolate chunks drizzled moderately with bourbon barrel-aged pure maple syrup and with too-dark coffee washing each bite down. All that was absent from the nose shows up here resulting in a vast improvement and a delicious treat (though it is still lacking in nuance and balance keeping it firmly in the dessert beer category). 4.5/5    M: The feel is a slight tug of war between the thick and creamy base stout and the thinning nature of high alcohol beers, bourbon aging, and maple syrup. What results is a tale of two beers with the prevailing impression of a slightly too thin beer. The bitterness and dryness is surprisingly (and pleasantly) on the high side, letting this be far more drinkable than it should be. There is medium alcohol heat on the end of each sip, which is expected but still unfortunate. This area could use some improvement. 3.5/5    O: First things first: this is a marked improvement over KBS, which is even more imbalanced and is generally (ironically) way over-barreled in addition to the too-strong nearly burnt coffee assault. The maple syrup bourbon barrels are slightly more subtle, and the balance of the flavors is much better for it. That said, this is not a beer that benefits much from scrutiny and analysis like this; no, this beer was meant to be savored, a hedonistic prize for those who want pure enjoyment. For them, it will succeed, but for me, well, I prefer more balance, more nuance, and more base beer. This is enjoyable, no doubt, but it is not worthy of the hype, the cost, or the search. At the time of its original release, CBS was innovative, but it has since been definitively surpassed time and time again, just like its brash older brother. Pair with seminal death metal group Morbid Angel's newest (and still somehow dated) release "Kingdoms Disdained". 4/5

Taste is roasted malts - quite a bit of burnt notes. Not a ton of bourbon barrel. Lots of coffee and chocolate. Dark fruit and tobacco linger around, along with black licorice. As this warmed, the sweetness intensified. The maple comes through a bit more as well. This is similar to KBS, although there are definitely differences. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 I've had this three times now in the last few weeks, since the 2017 came out. All were servings on tap. I also bought a bomber, but I haven't cracked it yet.    I can respect this beer, but I'm not in love with it. Yes, it's a richly flavored barrel aged stout. Once upon a time, that simple statement would be enough to rate a beer in the absolute top tier. But these days, a lot of brewers are making fine stouts with whisky barrel aging. Just being a barrel aged stout should not be enough to get a top rating.    Among the large number of barrel aged stouts I've had, CBS does stand out ... for being too damn sweet. I do like maple syrup, but not in these quantities. The maple sweetness steps on all the other flavors that are a part of the stout, which is too bad.    Hey, it's still pretty good, but I won't buy another bottle. There are much better barrel aged stouts available around here.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 2017 Edition 375ml bottle.  Look: Beautiful dark brew with a huge tan head.  Smell: Bakers chocolate, milk chocolate, Maraschino cherry truffles,   Taste: Wow! Nice big chocolatey stout, nougat, maple syrup, sweet red maraschino cherries and finishes with a slight hit of bourbon booziness. Nice thick mouthfeel.  Overall: Pretty amazing! Chocolate decadence in a glass. It's a fairly sweet affair, which may be off-putting to some. I am not sure what happened to the coffee, I just don't get the typical roasty to green flavours that coffee imparts on beer. I would seek this out but I would not age it, this needs to be drunk within it's expiry date - which in this case was October 27th, 2018.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 It's a well done big stout. Can't say I see the mania for it though. I never had the original but it was the first really rare one I couldn't get back when I first started trading, so it was legend. Maybe the game has caught up to them in the years since the first release. I enjoyed it, but I didn't $30 enjoy it. I can't say I really picked up on the maple either. Too much maple is too much, but It must have been very subtle. If you had given this to me blind and not told me anything about it, I'd have rated it a nicely done stout. But I'd do that for tons of big stouts these days, so I'm not seeing it as a standout amongst the many others. I would buy this again at $12.99, or $15 tops.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 As a huge fan KBS I knew that this would be good. And I wasn’t disappointed! Sweet chocolate and coffee. Thick and chewy. Super duper! 
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Yeah I bought into the hype and paid $27 for 1 pint 9.4 oz bottle here in Oklahoma and it doesn't disappoint. Beer pours a motor oil black with a dark tan head. The smell is alcohol, chocolate and some coffee. The flavor is first and foremost sweet then roasted malts with the chocolate, coffee maybe a hint of maple no strong presence of bourbon which is a good thing. A nice smooth stout just a tad overpriced but hey they got me.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 L - Vigorously poured into a snifter. Jet black with about an Inch of cocoa brown head, which stays around a lot longer than I would have thought at 11.7 abv.    S - Nose is full of chocolate and coffee with a lot of booziness in the back. Can only barely detect the maple syrup. Way boozier than I expected. Buddy even commented on how strong it smelled when I was pouring mine some 5 feet away.    T - Taste is the same chocolate and coffee, but it's only a tad hot in the back. Very sweet. Thankfully the booziness takes a backseat when actually drinking it. Maple syrup is ever so slight on the backend and only makes itself known upon swallowing. Delicious but I really expected a lot more maple syrup based in what I had heard. Flavors really pop as the beer warms up. Drink it slow.    F - Oh so creamy. Coats the mouth nicely to the point where the taste lingers around for quite a bit after swallowing. Feels like a stout is supposed to feel.    O - Absolutely a world class beer. I was not disappointed, but I don't think it quite lived up to the hype. I will certainly seek it out in the future, and if the opportunity arises will try earlier batches. I really want to try that overwhelmingly maple forward beer I have heard stories about, but this isn't quite that. Drink it slow and enjoy it, it is still fantastic.

Gorgeous pitch black with a mocha/maple head. Nice lacing all along.  The smell is incredible with coffee, maple, toffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla. Very attractive smell  The taste follows with a certain maple/toffee sweetness, some cocoa, some coffee, and a certain peppercorn spiciness. Some booziness but nothing overwhelming  The mouthfeel is very smooth, Very very nice.   Overall a wonderfully balanced beer, a gourmet beer. I think I prefer KBS but this one is wonderful in its own way. It's 11.7% ABV but I'm drinking so fast as it's crazy drinkable! It's gonna it me hard in some time, for now it's great. I'll try to age at least one bottle to see where it's going. Anyway it's great now!

This hasnt the excellent coffee touch and instead it has bourbon notes that becomes fairly strong as warms up, more than I like. 2017 version. Avg 3.85.    2 Dec 2018. De Hopt. Viendo Los 100 2x13-14. Version de 2018. Mucho mejor que la recordaba. El bourbon deja de ser el protagonista y pasa a a serlo delicioso sirope de arce con algunas notas a café   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Served on tap in a snifter glass. Nose is very similar to KBS, but more chocolate forward. Little to no maple syrup on the nose, even as it warms. Taste is very similar to the nose. It’s incredibly delicious, but again, chocolate forward and reminiscent of KBS. I wouldn’t say it meets the hype built up over the years, but it’s a fantastic beer nonetheless.

Strong coffee nose with vanilla bean, maple syrup and roasted malt as it warms to 55 degrees. Flavors of toasted tootsie roll, espresso, vanilla bread pudding with chocolate bits; barely any bourbon; lite maple on the finish. Somewhat creamy feel;medium full body - definitely not thin; light plus carbonation; fetishized Barrel/wood tongue coating. Overall this stout hits on all cylinders for me; no strong flavors, all in balance, and the maple contributed more to the feel as its flavor is subdued, which is fine by me; a pleasure to sip and experience.

S - bourbon, maple, coffee, chocolate, molasses, oak, booze. Wow there’s so much going on here!    T - I get a lot of bourbon at first. A little maple syrup but it’s subtle. Coffee and chocolate in equal measure. Booze is quite apparent at this young age. Not too sweet. Low bitterness.     F - medium-full creamy body.    O - I wish the maple was a little more forward, but still this is one amazing brew.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Pours pitch black with a well retained two inch tan head that left excellent lacing. Smells of dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, maple syrup and a hint of bourbon. Taste follows the nose with dark chocolate up front followed by dark roast coffee, toffee, vanilla, dark fruits, bourbon and maple syrup. I was expecting far more of the barrel and maple flavors. Medium to heavy bodied, light carbonation, thick and creamy mouth feel.

I’d always resigned myself to never trying this beer as I had no idea that it would ever reach UK shores. Needless to say, I leapt at the opportunity to get my hands on some. This is simply exceptional. Maybe it was the anticipation and I know that most heavyweight stouts have a fairly uniform appearance but I’ve never seen a beer look more stunning in the glass. The depth of flavour is incredible and the mouthfeel is divine. It’s really difficult to define “balanced” but CBS ticks every box in this regard. If only the aroma was a tad more assertive, this would be utter perfection in my book. Better than KBS? Maybe just a touch. Love it. Cheers!

Smells like Nina Agdal in a nightie, while the taste is akin to Nina’s mom in a corset. See, I went with said Victoria’s Secret hotties mother because there is something mature about CBS with every sip.     So yeah, drinking this intoxicating beverage is like being with a Victoria’s Secret model and her mom.    Prost!

Black, bit of ruby brown edge, holds a thin halo of tan foam that gives up a little lace.    Aroma: Bourbon barrel, black bread, caramel malt, earthy hop, with a harsh burnt edge that might be coffee or heavy roasted barley. Light sour stout note as well. Frankly, not super inviting, a bit boozy and burnt.     Taste: It's everything it says on the tin. Barrel charred bourbon soaked wood, sweet malty stout, maple candy finish. A little bitter chocolate in the finish. Dark fruit flavors, plum, fig, purple grape, all have gone quite ripe and begun to ferment.     Mouthfeel: Heavy body, low medium carbonation, warming slowly drying finish, little chew.    Overall: Currently #13 on the all time beer list. I understand the hype. I made a special trip to pay $25 for the bomber, and have no regrets. I probably should have let the bottle sit for a few months, it may have mellowed out the bourbon and let the cast of characters shine a little brighter, but it's easy drinking as it stands fairly fresh.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Pours from the bottle an opaque dark brown with a voluminous, tan head that fades slowly, leaving plenty of lace.  The aroma is led by roast coffee, dark chocolate and vanilla with touches of molasses, brown sugar and maple syrup.   The taste is big and smooth. Medium-roast coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, a hint of dark fruit. A slightly bitter, dry finish with a maple aftertaste and a hit of boozy warmth.  Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Superb.

That said, there is an awesome depth of flavor present in this beer that changes as the glass gets lower and the beer warms. All the flavors seem well balanced without any one getting the higher hand.

The flavor is a blend of bitter, dark roasted coffee along with sweet maple syrup and a bit of smoke initially. The milk chocolate and bourbon seem to show as it warms.

This tastes like a liquid chocolate chip cookie. Tad bit of bourbon heat and maple warmth.

Glad I did. Pitch black pour, slight tan head. Chocolate, bourbon and maple aroma, sweet but not overly sweet, very nice blend. Subtle and good bourbon taste, not overly strong but a not overwhelming, balanced with sweet chocolate, syrup and coffee. Excellent tasting beer, one of my favorites yet. Thin texture, nice body but not thick like similar offerings. Very smooth going down. I enjoyed this one over 30 minutes, very nice beer to slowly enjoy and savor.    Overall, excellent offering, will save bottles and see how they aged down the road. I've liked Breakfast Stout and KBS, but didn't rate them as high when I first rated, will have to revisit.

Taste is a mix of bourbon and vanilla with coffee with some maple notes and some black chocolate notes with a ton of residual sugar notes. Body is full with oily texture and good carbonation with light warming alcohol notes. Very rich and decadent while retaining some good drinkability but maybe a tad too sweet at the end of the day.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A: Poured into a snifter to a deep black beer topped by a dense three finger tan head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass leaving some lacing  S: Smells of coffee, chocolate, oak and roasted malts with a little maple  T: Taste is coffee, dark chocolate, and a little roasted malt. Nice oak, light vanilla and a hint of caramel along with a nice undertone of maple throughout. Swallow is more oak, coffee, maple, chocolate, and some light caramel and vanilla.   M: This beer is big and silky on the palate with a slightly velvety feel on the palate. Carbonation is on the low side and close to perfect for the style.  O: Overall this is a very nice beer with some really great flavors and complexity. Easy to drink and alcohol is well hidden. Maple is a hard flavor to balance in a beer and this one seems to do pretty well. It's there but it doesn't dominate though if that is what people are expecting. Worth a try if you like the style and Founders.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 A slight notch above KBS, but need to know taste can vary pending batch. I have had both draft and bottle. Not overly sweet on draft that I had, but the bottle was a little sweeter than I care for.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5 A: Appearance is a dark brown/black color, essentially opaque. Nice brown head that fades slowly.  S: The aroma contains strong notes of bourbon, barrel wood, and maple.  T: The taste starts out semi-sweet with very well incorporated flavors of bourbon, chocolate, maple, and malt. The high ABV is barely noticeable and the aftertaste is muted, but great.  M: Crisp and smooth, medium/full body, medium carbonation (I would have liked a little more), finish is slightly sticky.  O: This beer doesn't deserve a review, it deserves a parade. There's nothing else I even want to say, just stockpile it, age it, drink it. Then repeat. I had the 2017 vintage and, while it was incredible when fresh, I'm certain that it will only improve with age.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Enjoyed on draught in a snifter.    Pours black, similar head to KBS. The maple and bourbon really compliment each other very well. Flavor was greatly enhanced once warmed up. Certainly worth the hype for me and I'm really glad I got to have some. I would really wish for it to be sold in 12oz.
