look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 Pours seal brown with a paltry skim of khaki foam. Aroma is positively rife with dark chocolate, accented by toffee, chili peppers, coffee, and roasted malt.    The taste features a melange of roasted malt, coffee, chilis, marshmallow, and brown sugar up front, augmented by earthy hops that settle in behind the more overt spiciness of the chilis. Warming coaxes out notes of dark chocolate and vanilla while invigorating the chili spice. Hefty body and moderate carbonation make for a full, substantive mouthfeel.    Overall, this is a beefy, flavorful stout that may have a little too much going on for its own good. I've never been a big believer in chili peppers in beer, and while these ones don't exactly run roughshod over the other ingredients, they clearly hold more sway, quite possibly to its detriment. Nevertheless, it remains a robust, warming offering on a cold winter's night.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Not the best imperial stout I've had, but definitely top 3 or 4. I like the heat, but I think it should be dialed down SLIGHTLY to emphasize more of the cocoa nibs and coffee. Absolutely delicious, though and I wish I could rate into the tenths better on this app. Overall, I feel it handsomely earns it's rating. Must have!

This is my first beer from Prairie and I’ve been eyeing it for a while on the shelf at Grassroots in Jax wondering about the hype. At $9 for a 12oz bottle one has to assume this is not just a great, but stellar beer.    I chose this as a celebration beer for one of the biggest moments of my life. A true “bomb” of a result/outcome and couldn’t be happier, though also still shocked. Probably need to sleep and a new morning will bring clarity.    But this beer is also bringing clarity. That it is almost certainly worth the cost. And that just because a beer includes hot peppers doesn’t mean they’ll overwhelm nor serve as a reason to shun a beer with such an ingredient.    I’ve let this beer breathe for hours as I sipped it and now it’s drinking like a Port. How any beer can be this good is mind boggling. You get the coffee and chocolate without a doubt, dark yet sweet and earthy. The vanilla is more subtle and the peppers even subtler, though there’s a bit more pepper heat than alcohol heat. The booze creates a pleasant tingle that finishes so well. Body is silky smooth. This is a bonkers beer. A definite treat and probably the one experience I’ll have with it unless it’s on draft or in another form such as Pirate Bomb. Totally worth the money, the celebration, and the long-winded description. A masterpiece!

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Bottled 9/28/18, consumed 12/9/18    Poured deep, oily, pitch black with no head at all and no lacing. Aroma is of cacao and chili peppers with a little bit of coffee, definitely improves as it warms. Taste is rich, sweet chocolate, coffee, and lesser notes of vanilla and caramel malts. The pepper serves to warm and thankfully doesn't dominate the taste at all. Feel is medium, could definitely stand to be a bit fuller & thicker, lower carbonation, high ABV worked in very well.    Overall fell just a tad shy of expectations from such a lofty reputation. Certainly enjoyed it though and will be looking to try more from Prairie.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 LOOK: Very dark/black - no light or even a glow - dark tan head - about 1/2 finger - less than hoped but ok for style and high ABV  SMELL: Rich chocolate, caramel, and coffee. Sweet and dessert-like. ABV is so high you can smell the alcohol. Some woody notes but all ingredients are identifiable.  TASTE: Huge blast of chocolate and charred wood. Then the coffee, toffee, vanilla, and malt come through briefly only to be swept aside by a powerful alcohol bite. The alcohol goes through the nose and you feel it down to your toes. A definite warming feeling kicks in. It starts to heat up then with some of the chili peppers. It has a decent earthiness and spice with the peppers there. Trails off with some earthiness, roasted nuts, and wood. There is a slight funkiness and weird aftertaste that I didn't care for but it subsided quickly.  FEEL: A bit thinner than I expected but still a decent full bodied beer. Some carbonation remains after a few minutes, but pretty much flat after that. Expected with a super high 13% ABV  OVERALL: A really good beer. It just had a few shortcomings that I couldn't score higher on. The off flavor that pops up here and there is unpleasant. Not as aromatic as hoped with so many ingredients, and quite low on carbonation. Still would not be afraid to buy this one again. I hoped for more chili peppers and heat with the mention of peppers, but it is pretty subdued. There wasn't enough coffee for me either.

The smell is extraordinary, 5/5: woody notes, cognac barrel, sour cherry liquor, coffee, red wine.  The taste has a strong expresso influence initially, with strong acidity, then sour cherries in alcohol, dark chocolate, licorice, sweet vanilla. Oily and persistent, with some spicy notes (probably form the chili).  The strong alcohol content is not hidden, but actually present in a really nice warming way, as a good cognac.  The wood is delicately felt on the background.  A really really good beer with its own specific character!

Taste follows the aroma with coffee taking the lead followed by the roasted malt . The chilli pepper was very present and the heat was really well incorporated, never overpowering but very much there.   Overall it is an excellent beer, definitely above average on every level  Only criticism is that sometimes the chilli tasted a bit like unripe green peppers.

Don’t think the regular Bomb! is aged in bourbon barrels but it seems present in the smell.    Taste follows the nose. Only difference is the slightest hint of heat from the chili peppers in the aftertaste. The bourbon or booziness is also more subdued than the smell suggested.    Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Love it.    Overall this is a really solid stout. The smell had me worried it would be overly bourbon-y but I was really pleasantly surprised. I think I like Birthday Bomb a little more, but man this is a good stout.

Dark black color with some mild lingering tan head and some spotty lingering lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, dark roast coffee and molasses. Tastes of dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, raisin, currant, caramel and a great malt backbone. Very smooth, slightly creamy with quite a thick mouthfeel. Great amount of carbonation. As with their Birthday Stout, this was a very high ABV beer but I tasted very little strong alcohol flavor. I would love to see an outstanding beer like this aged in bourbon barrels - it’s so good and so tasty and just so damn smooth. Well done!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours jet black, but if you hold a thinner layer to the light you catch a red-brown glow. Dark brown head with short retention. I don't care about lacing. Am I really supposed to?  The aroma comes through with roast coffee, burnt molasses, a bit of dark chocolate, some raisins and plums, bourbon. On the palate, roasted dark espresso beans and some bitter coffee grinds punch through sticky molasses, chocolate, vanilla, spice, bittersweet orange marmalade, and bourbon. I don't taste the chilis. A somewhat syrupy medium body stands up well to the 13.5% ABV. Carbonation is pretty low. Though I'd prefer it to be a bit creamier, fuller bodied and slightly sweeter, it is rich in flavor and well balanced.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Looks like a March or a January 2017 bottling date, as stamped on bottle neck (03171).  Black colored body, with slight mahogany back lit highlights. Not much of a head upon initial pouring but stays around as interrupted cap and ring. Quite a bit of spotting patterns left behind.   Chiles are still present in the aroma, along with roasted malts, chocolate, and vanilla.  Taste has dark roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, and vanilla. Quite well balanced.  Mouth feel is medium to thick. Okay carbonation.  Beer has maintained its main advertised features for a term of 1-1/2 years in the bottle. Overall a very well balanced and taste nuanced beer.

The hard pour on the beer into the glass produced a one finger light tan head. The head quickly dissipated, it was sad to see this. The color is SRM 35 A dark oily brown and is not opaque. The head reduced to a ring around the glass. The appearance of the beer is fair.     The aromas of the beer are dark roasted coffee with chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, chili, molasses, brown sugar, dark roasted malt, biscuits, yeast, and char.     The coffee and the chili is prevalent. Additional flavors are chocolate, vanilla, molasses, brown sugar, char, oak, biscuits, yeast, caramel, toffee, anise, and a touch smoky.     The mouthfeel of the beer is thick and chewy.     The body of the beer is full, medium-low carbonation, and a full finish.     The flavors in the beer are phenomenal. The beer is rich and satisfying. I enjoyed this beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 I’ve walked past this one several times and balked at the price. I finally decided to treat myself.  Pours a viscous engine oil looking dark brown/black liquid. Due to the high ABV, there is no head, instead, a minimalist creamy tan film and thin lacing throughout.  Lovely aroma that highlights cocoa, vanilla, coffee, and chocolate. A spicy chili pepper aroma more pronounced throughout.  The taste opens sweetly, with decadent flavors of chocolate, dark caramel, brown sugar, vanilla and dessert liqueur. Minimal perception of hops bitterness, instead, an espresso like roasted malt flavor is subtly perceptible amidst the sweetness and spices. Speaking of spice, the chili pepper spice is the centerpiece and what truly sets this imperial stout apart. It starts off slightly perceptible in the finish. However, it gradually develops in the middle palate, heating up the mouth and throat, never overwhelming and balancing beautifully with the chocolate cake sweetness.   Full bodied, viscous, rich and robust. Amazing balance between sweet and spicy. Alcohol is beautifully hidden and drinks dangerously well.  So worth it! A true wow beer! Delicious!   
look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Pour is jet black practically. A big warming coffee, dark chocolate, and minor cinnamon filled aroma. The coffee in the nose is probably the boldest aroma and it is fantastic. And I think you can smell a little chili pepper in there. Roasty flavor is quickly sweetened by milk chocolate notes which then transition to a mild warming burn from the pepper. That note really lingers long past the finish. You can tell this thing is big, but not 13% big. Price tag was steep, but if you can get by that I’d say it is worth trying.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. THere is no dating on the label or bottle. Ive had it for about a year in my cellar but received in a trade where it was a vintage bottle from partner cellar. So I dont know what year this is.  The beer pours a dark cola brown with a dense creamy tan head of 1.5 cm that fades quickly to a sturdy edge layer. the foam lingers on the edge until the glass is empty. Very active fine carbonation streams rising to the surface of my glass based on the surface spiral movements, which is a cool impact.    Lots of roasted malt and dark chocolate on the nose, also with some coffee ground and a bit of spicy peppery notes. Vegetal pepper not the black pepper spice that can be attached to ethanol notes. No hop presence on this big stout at the aroma.  First sip reveals a silky textured beer with average body and fine gentle carbonation. thought it may be a little thicker based on the pour, but this is good so far. I get milk chocolate and darker bittersweet chocolate notes up front, with a dose of roasted malt and coffee grounds in the middle which is followed by lingering brown sugar and some spicy pepper note. The pepper is still tingly long after each swallow.   I never get any hint of the 13% which is pretty amazing considering the booze in this bottle. COuld make it a little dangerous. I wonder if the spicy pepper note would disappear if cooking with this beer.....it could be the ultimate chilli beer I think. But it is also very enjoyable to drink, so I understand not going the cooking route. Glad to have tried this one in a bottle as Ive only had draft prior to tonight.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.5 Pours a super dark brown that is almost black. The head is also very dark - like a chocolate cappuccino color. The nose has plenty of roast along with a touch of heat. The flavor is less roasty than the nose might indicate but the roast is still very forward along with some residual chocolate sweetness. The heat comes along on the finish and is on the verge of overly done. The body is adequate for the style but I was expecting something thicker (for some reason).

L: Just a film of earthy brown head, with tendrils of richer reddish cacao color. It's funny; I thought all pitch black stouts were essentially the same color, but this one seems to be significantly less red at the edges when held to light. I don't think I've seen a darker brew.    S: Upon going for a sniff, a sweet chocolate liquor presence is immediately interrupted by the onset of booze, followed by cooling vanilla and the heat from the chili peppers. Taking a deeper whiff, tobacco and that coffee come out, but the coffee is mellow and nearly drowns in the syrupy chocolate aroma. A bit of a grassy pepper aroma, nutty oak, and a boozy bourbon note accent the finish.    T: Taste confirmed: barrel-aging is apparently not necessary to get a great Imperial Stout. Semi-sweet chocolate is clearly the principal flavoring ingredient, as it appears first, and is the last thing on the finish. Heavy vanilla and buttery caramel and toffee appear alongside it, but the vanilla dissipates just after that touch of spicy starts to set in, at which point you do taste a distinct coffee acidity and roast character. Finally, a hot, boozy bourbon finish smoothed by semi-sweet chocolate.    F: I wish it were more carbonated. I would think it would be, not being Barrel-Aged. That noted, it could hardly be any smoother. Like velvet.    O: As it is what they are famous for, this is the first brew I have had from Prairie. This is also the first time in my life that I have wanted to pay a visit to Oklahoma.

There is just a hint of carbonation. Finish is boozy and somewhat sweet, with heat from the chili peppers. Overall, this is a thoroughly enjoyable Imperial Stout - not the best I've had, but it's up there.

Equal attention is given to the smooth chocolate, bitter coffee, creamy vanilla while all being effectively backed by a chili spice which never becomes too overwhelming. The feel is slick and creamy, and the big ABV is masked entirely. All in all, an incredibly well-structured imperial stout, even if its core flavors felt less asserted; this, in retrospect, could very well be due to the at least 5 months since the bottling date. I'd love to try this fresh.

Fine, light tan head dissipates quickly.    Smell is chocolate cake with strong coffee. That includes the icing, by the way, which somewhat comes across as lactic. A bit roasty.    Taste is strong, but not quite top-notch. Roasted coffee and malted milk lead, but there's a bit of olive oil along with it. (I can eat a disturbing amount of olives from those little snack packs, but I'd rather not have it in a dark brew.) It's not notably bitter, and there's a mild lactose sweetness. Slight savoriness. No heat, contrary to what the label leads one to believe. Cacao and vanilla are very buried, maybe due to age, but I'd expect those still to stand up for a year if it's a stout.    Aftertaste is a bit smoky, with some molasses. Maybe like a good rum. The taste might not be particularly sweet, and the aftertaste might be sweeter. I can get a good amount of creamy carbonation, and it's not prickly at all. I can hardly detect the C2H5(OH). Well crafted, and I'm wondering if I let it age too much.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Description: Appearance is pitch black with a light, khaki, head. Stout-like in every way. Coffee and roasted flavors jump up immediately while some dark chocolate and sweetness has a more subdued appearance. Taste is more balanced than the smell as the sweetness and coffee come through more readily. The flavors are balanced and complex and I think...yeah...I can taste it...there's a hint of chili on the finish; just enough to be noticeable without making a big splash. Very subtle. For a beer with an ABV this high, the alcohol is not very apparent. Feel is very nice overall as this is creamy, rich, thick and smooth.    Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely drink it again) This belongs with the Who's Who of popular, big-name stouts. It reminded me a heck of a lot of KBS, with the exception of KBS being barrel-aged and this having some chili spice. It's certainly one to try. I had it on draft at a grocery store in Ohio, which might mean we've reached peak craft beer, but I'll take that gladly.

Attractive.     Nose: big coffee as you would expect. A little spice, burnt caramel, nuts, dark chocolate. Big, upfront.     Taste: follows the nose with coffee dominating. Chili spice comes through on the back end.     Mouthfeel: good viscosity, oiliness. Feels good, smooth, relatively low carbonation.     Overall: really like it although you have to enjoy the coffee because it’s big and bold. Fairly complex and spice on the back is a really nice finish.

With that being said I got a bad bottle last year that tasted like you were sucking on a penny. I contacted the people at Prairie just to let them know and they were really rude about the whole thing even though I was just trying to give them a heads up. So while this beer is delicious I now choose other beers in this style to help support other breweries who care a bit more about their customers.

The code stamp has become illegible, but I know it's at least two years old. Served slightly chilled.    Impenetrable to light, this jet black-coloured stout starts off with a thin, frothy, tan-coloured head that fizzles off in under a minute; a quick swirl of the glass kicks it back up, but it fades just as quickly thereafter. A nondescript collar remains, but there's no cap, and very little lace. Not much to look at, but it smells pretty damn good - smoked ancho chili peppers and rich cocoa notes are easily discerned, with roasted coffee beans and molasses also coming through fairly clearly. Very subtle suggestions of prune and raisin, too. Not getting a lot of vanilla - which is fine by me, as IMO vanilla works best in beer when it's used sparingly.    Very tasty, even when aged. Notes of molasses and milk chocolate are soon shoved off to the margins by its roasted malt backbone and robust adjunct bill. Cocoa, dark chocolate-covered coffee beans and vanilla beans come together with exquisite cohesion, especially during the tail end of the sip. It concludes with an earthy, highly roasted flavour which plays beautifully with the hints of smoke and the mild heat of the ancho chilies that linger briefly into the aftertaste. Some roasty astringency and a touch of licorice, too. I am genuinely shocked at how flawlessly well the 13% abv is hidden/integrated - I barely notice any warmth from it whatsoever. Medium-full in body, with very gentle carbonation that hardly registers on the surface of the palate; the texture is mostly smooth, slick, and quite soft. My only regret is that I don't have a younger bottle available to use for a side-by-side comparison.    Final Grade: 4.4, a fabulous A grade. Prairie Bomb! is currently the 103rd most highly rated beer on BA, and now that I've had a glass of the stuff it's not hard to see how it wound up in that relatively prestigious spot. The chili peppers, vanilla, cocoa and coffee are present in such painstakingly perfect proportion that there's no way it could be an accident - it's just a wonderfully well-crafted stout that I am glad I had the chance to try (aged or not). Well worth seeking out - if I'm lucky enough to acquire another bottle, I'll drink it fresh... but from experience I'd say it does hold up reasonably well in the cellar.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Ironically this is a beer, I am told, that lives up to its name: (the) Bomb! This 13% ABV American Imperial Stout has an assortment of ingredients that conjure up images of a deep, shadowy and impressive brew that the Gods themselves might sup on within the mighty halls of Valhalla: Spaceship Earth roasted coffee, cacao nibs, vanilla beans, and ancho chilli peppers - yep, that’s a recipe for “awesome-sauce” in any legitimate definition of said word (which I borrowed from ‘Parks and Recreation’). Indeed I’ve never had the urge to waffle less in one of these preambles than I do right now: the desire to crack this dark temptress open and imbibe the black ooze within is a powerful aphrodisiac that I am too weak to resist *crown cap pops* [still managed to waffle though - the waffle is strong with me].    Poured from a 355ml bottle into a Duvel tulip.    A: Deep opaque inky black nightmare of a body with a chocolate brown dense head that sticks around impressively well and belies that 13% ABV that is waiting to consume me soon enough. 9/10.    S: Earthy AF, roasty AF as well... verdant roasted cold-drip coffee mingles freely with vanilla and coffee cherry hints, a lingering sweet roasted malt base, then a bit of smoke and dark chocolate. Not getting much in the way of the ancho chilli peppers, but as we [I! The Royal "we"! You know, the editorial...] know that chilli in beer tends to come across more in the flavour profile (and generally in the back of the throat). 9/10.    T: Flavour profile hits with that pervading earthy AF/roasty AF character noted above and follows through to a broad mid-palate coffee/dark chocolate sweetness and a good sweet/bitter balance IMO (maybe a tad towards the dessert side if you’re not a fan of dessert beers though). Hints of vanilla and smoke come in towards the finish, and yes there’s a chilli bite at the back, though I reckon Bomb! could get away with more chilli. Balance is pretty sublime - a real Imp Stout sipper right here. Bit of booze in the aftertaste that detracts a little though. 9/10.    M: Heavy bodied and a bit too sticky and cloying here - less of that please. 7/10.    D: Apart from a mouthfeel that requires a good old tongue scrapping, this is a solid Imp Stout that puts Prairie on the map for me. It’s like a halfway between Founders Breakfast Stout and Omnipollo Selassie, with the chilli adding a nice touch of heat to the proceedings. Price is a sore point at $23 AUD a bottle, yep. 8/10.    Food match: Something dark and spicy: Mole Poblano with rice and black bean.

Poured slightly chilled into a snifter. Dark like oil with very little head, fading to thin tan ring. Very noticeable chili pepper and coffee on the nose. First sips are strong coffee forward, with a hint of the chili in the background. Thick mouthfeel, satisfying for the style, with barely any carbonation. After letting it warm to open the profile, cocoa comes forward over the coffee, and the vanilla pokes out a bit. Good flavor balance, no bitterness, no hoppiness, but all malt bomb with a little heat. I have a second bottle to cellar, so we'll see how it develops over time. Next time I'd start with it warmer as the chill seemed to stunt it too much.

No head formation, but residual hazelnut brown bubbles did form around edge of glass. Minimal lacing on glass.     Smell: Wow. Chocolate, roasted malts, and pepper on the nose. Earthy smell as well, with some coffee. Maybe slight bit of booze on the nose, but very well could be the peppers. Smells fantastic. Full of chocolate, peppers in malts. Really impressed.     Taste: Follows the nose. Peppers take the dominant role, but in a pleasant way. Chocolate and malts back up the peppers, with a dark fruit complexity. Prune, plum, and fig are present in the flavor, adding a subtle sweetness. Coffee, and earthy in flavor. Little bit of bitterness in flavor as well, typical in imperial stout.     Feel: Medium in body, but not that heavy. Carbonation seems to be a little high, but not overly done.     Overall: This is a delicious stout. Everything is balanced and very enjoyable. Don't have much else to say, other than it is totally worth a try. Cheers!

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 L: Deep brown/black with a thin layer of light-brown head.  S: Chocolate, booze, cinnamon, spice, roasted malts  T: A typical "Mexican hot chocolate" taste: Chocolate, coffee, cinnamon, a tad bit of spicy heat, a bit sweet. Tasty, but nothing extraordinary. An interesting and relatively positive aftertaste. Also a tiny bit of metallic taste. One compliment I will give is how completely disguised the 13% ABV is.   F: Creamy, but with a crisp carbonation kick. Medium body.  O: This was quite good. I don't quite know if it's "da bomb" though (sorry I had to). Actually a bit underwhelming considering the hype. Definitely a very good beer. Is it worth $10 a bottle - probably not.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 This is the first stout that I have used ancho chili peppers inside of it. The chili pepper is not overdone which is pleasant but it is definitely there on the backend. The 14% abv is well hidden. The nordaggios coffee is tasty and that chocolate is prevalent too. The vanilla is being dominated by the other flavors which is not a surprise to me. It's a little tough to figure out I want to drink after drinking a bottle of this. I don't know maybe I should drink a few non adjunct stouts. Anyways, I like this stout a lot and it might even go well with some hearty & spicy mexican dishes for a pairing. It's different & the label is eye catching. There is NO DATE on the bottle and that coffee & chocolate is going to dissipate over time. I don't care for the wax which is a little hard to get off of the cap. Cheers! A-

Really kicks the tastebuds    Mouthfeel- Thick and chewy, but not syrupy. High alcohol content mixed with the fine carbonation leave a tingly feeling on the way down.     Overall- Probably not my favorite imperial stout ever, but a great tasting, strong, worthwhile beer.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 12 oz poured aggressively into a goblet.   Look: thick like oil. very dark brown to black. 1 finger head with a very deep mocha color. Faded fast but for a beautiful ring showing my progress.  Smell: Strong hit of coffee, some slight vanilla and chocolate makes it's way through the coffee. Sorta gets hints of vanilla wafer.  Taste: Coffee up front and hard. A bit of spiciness hits after the coffee like a bar of chocolate with paprika and cayenne. Just the right amount of spice. Not overpowering and just a hint. As it warms and I was accustomed to the coffee and spice, more malt, vanilla and bitter chocolate stood out. Absolutely delicious, top notch.  Feel: smooth and silky and bubbly. Not too syrupy where it gets unpleasant towards the end.   Overall: excellent beer. Wish it was more accessible in my region. I'd keep a case at all times.

Pretty amazing how much flavor they got into the beer without it being overpowering at 13% abv, starts smooth with chocolate & vanilla taste and finishes with a light hint of spice from chili, just enough to make you notice it and not enough to take away from anything else. Great beer !

Appearance: Black in colour with a slightly less than one finger brown head that had dissipated to a thin layer and left some spotty lacing.    Aroma: Roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and chili peppers.    Taste: Similar to the aroma with chocolate and vanilla followed by hints of coffee and chili pepper spice.    Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, medium bodied with low carbonation.    Overall: A very nice and balanced Imperial Stout that I could just keep drinking.

Pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer doesn't form much crown, despite pouring out rather hard. Forms to be pitch black with an outer ring on top of caramel colored bubbles. The smell is huge roasty coffee mixing with the peppers and layers of sweetness. Ahh I love fresh bomb. The taste brings the layers of sweetness to the front with notes of caramel, chocolate and vanilla. The peppers are rather muted this year, which I do not care for because the peppers are my favorite part. But even with the peppers barely tingling, it's bringing so much other flavor. Mouthfeel is thick, very well carbonated and coats the mouth. Overall, I love this beer.

Pours oily dark brown/black with a rich mocha and burnt umber head, smooth nose of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and espresso beans, even a hint of raisin. But the bomb explodes on the tongue, filling the mouth with chocolate and coffee in all its glory, and when the ancho chili knits up the finish, the whole experience is sublime. Pronounced but restrained, bold yet subtlely balanced with the roundest, most satisfying mouth feel yet. This is the definition of artisanal - the perfect name for the perfect beer.

Call me a cheapskate but I just couldn't bring myself to buy an $8 to $10 12oz beer. Well, I won this offering in a FB craft beer page and was so happy when I did - I would actually get to know what the hubbub is all about on these - and boy am I glad. The "Bomb!" has a beautifully chocolate look - deep dark brown, almost black with no head or lacing but really, who cares? (You'll know what I'm talking about when you pour this thing out for yourself.) The smell is a nice blend of chocolate, coffee, hints of vanilla and with no smell of booze, which was surprising considering this brew is at 13% ABV. The mouthfeel was about as perfect as it can get for me - creamy, smooth, and lightly carbonated (exactly like I like it.) The taste was exceptional with an equal blend of coffee and chocolate and the boozy flavor though not prominent as taste, it is prominent as a distinct burning sensation down the throat (something I have not experienced with other high ABVs.) Overall, this beer is definitely outstanding and one I won't hesitate in the future to shell out the bucks...

Poured the expected solid black color, with about 1/3 inch of light brown head that had minimal retention and no lacing.    A nice dose of chocolate is at the front of the nose, with some soft roast notes in the background. On the tongue, the cocoa is upfront, with the pepper heat coming across in the middle and back. I didn't pick up any of the coffee mentioned on the label, which is a positive for me.    The body was much thinner than I prefer in the style, and had a surprisingly dry finish. Drinkability would depend on how one feels about about cocoa and peppers; I like cocoa, and am OK with the peppers, so this worked for me. Overall, a very nice brew. One that maybe doesn't quite meet its hype, but is still worth grabbing if you see it.

On the pour and in the glass, black with no visible light or color variation. Last few ounces aggressively poured resulted in a 1/2 finger of head that faded fairly quickly. Nice lacing and head woke up with some swirling of the glass. The nose is wonderful, dark roast coffee, chipotle peppers, dark chocolate, raisins, and figs. Thick mouth feel, low carbonation, silky and smooth. Taste, wow, this is really something! I got dark chocolate, maybe a Mexican milk chocolate, vanilla, and dark chocolate covered espresso bean finish. Delicious. And at 13%, nearly no booze evident. Overall, an excellent stout. Sort of like a dynamic mix of Xocoveza and WOOtstout.

The pepper is really unique and adds a spice that is the perfect amount for the beer, and it really is hard to tell it's 13% ABV. The flavor is simply delicious, dark, bold, a bit sweet but not overpowering. Not exactly affordable regularly but worth picking up as a treat.

Pours like warm chocolate syrup, very thick, extremely dark ribbon and basically black in the glass. A thin layer of fine, mocha colored bubbles with barely any lacing and little legs.  Double chocolate cake aroma out of the bottle. Cocoa powder, vanilla, maybe a bit of tobacco. Coffee beans and distant espresso or caramel macchiato, dark cherries, some chili heat tickling the tip of my nose. Nice roasted grain background. Old ancho chilis and a new inky book smell come through clearly when it warms up.  Chocolate cake and fudge brownie, coffee, lots of dark, complex fruits. Earthy oolong tea flavors, roasted chocolaty chilis sneaking through, and some bitterness towards the end with chocolate. At room temp, a bite of chili shows up at the end with more roast, a bit of vanilla bean, and less fruit.  Average mouthfeel for a big imperial stout. A little on the thick side, not incredibly sticky, easier to drink for the style. Sweet at first, drying out some until the semi-sweet finish with a little numbness on the lips and tip of the tongue from the chilis.    Very good imperial stout that almost completely hides the alcohol at this age while still showing a certain strength. The cocoa and coffee definitely work well for each other, the grains, and hops. The chili doesn't overpower anything, instead giving a boost to its complexity all around. The vanilla is a subtle, lovely presence in the aroma, and although it isn't perceived as much in the flavor it's still giving a little something. Just great.

Those chili peppers really shine... Fantastic beer, not one for the faint of heart for sure!

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 12 oz bottle coded 01416.  Darkest mahogany only distinguishable from black by comparison with a black card or shirt. A centimeter brown head, low but with staying power. Ring of carbonation remains a half hour after pouring. Heavy curtain of lacing.  Strong aroma of coffee, cinnamon, ginger, oatmeal cookie.  Tasting brings cocoa nibs, cinnamon, raisins. Coffee and peppers are present, but not overbearing, perhaps due to this bottle’s age. I like the incorporation of all the flavors that I don’t get when this beer is young.  Smooth, full body. Alcohol is present but not hot for 13% coming on the back of the tongue. A little kick aftertaste. Flavors linger in the mouth and on the lips.  I didn’t really appreciate this one until after trying the whole gamut of coffee and pepper stouts. Still among the best, ages gracefully.

S- Chocolate is what I picked up the most, with roasted malt and a tinge of pepper.  T - Chocolate taste with some roasted coffee, light pepper , some vanilla and caramel. Slight alcohol burn.  F- Excellent mouthfeel! So many stouts have over the top flavor but a thin mouthfeel, at least to my taste. This one has it nailed. Creamy feel with the right heft.  O - This is now a go to when I want a well crafted stout. Especially that the hype has died down and it is readily available off the shelf at $6.99 a botlle. Well worth it!

Overall the taste has a bit of a smoked element which I attribute to the peppers but it's not spicy at all, just flavorful and exotic. I'm not sure I like it but it is so very intriguing and different. I was prepared to not like this but it was certainly worth a try even if you don't like chili adjuvants.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 L -- Pours a very dark black body with a surprisingly large medium-brown head produced with moderate pour. The size of the head is quite remarkable given the ABV and prior reviews. Some retention and good lacing  S -- Coffee, dark chocolate, chili, vanilla, sarsaparilla, and caramel  T -- Bittersweet chocolate, nougat, coffee, graham cracker, vanilla, and a little chili heat. Reminds me a lot of Stone Xocoveza but with less cinnamon/nutmeg character and more spiciness (a big plus)  F -- Reasonably big mouthfeel (but not huge), medium carb. Fluffy, semi-velvety. Nice mild burn down the throat thanks to the chili spice. Not quite as 'full' feeling as most stouts of this ABV  O -- A nice stout to break out during the holiday season thanks to the warming spice profile. Quite pricey at ~$9/12 oz bottle, but definitely worth a try if you see it. Here in MA, the only brew on the market that is similar is Xocoveza    89/100

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Got a flight of these beers starting with this as the first. Like all the variations it poured very pitch black dense with a nice layer of mocha tinted head. Smell it's quite nice sweet with a touch of cocoa nibs and coffee with very to little ethanol. Taste is very smooth for the caliber again cocoa nibs and slight coffee shine with mild Taste of molasses and leather. For 13% the body was quite smooth drinking more of a medium body beverage. Overall I can't justify spending almost a dollar an ounce again but it was a very good beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.25 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.5 So the day I got this I was filled with big smiles and they stayed rolling as the beer poured into my snifter. Pours black with thin creamy head, but smells of nothing special. I don't pick up anything but some alcohol faintness and malt. So I take a sip and have to say where's all that chocolatey, vanilla, chilli pepper goodness? Sure the chilli peppers do shine on the throat slightly but I do not pick up any chocolate or vanilla. The alcohol is a bit hidden on the taste for a 13% beer but I've had many better stouts of similar caliber. This to me is nothing special, wouldn't call it world class, and definitely doesn't belong on top 250. It can be found everywhere near me and sits in shops as a shelf turd. For $8 a bottle, I would say there is plenty of better beers out in the world.

L: pours pitch black with about half a finger of tan head  S: Huge notes of coco nibs and chili peppers, small amount of coffee  T: Lots of coffee and chocolate with a little bit of heat from the peppers on the finish. The vanilla becomes noticeable as it warms up.   F: Thick mouthfeel with little carbonation.  O: A very enjoyable beer that reminds me of a boozier xocoveza. If your a fan of coco nibs, ancho chilies and coffee, this beer is for you.

Stout nuttiness/caramel comes through as the beer warms, vanilla sweetness and mild, smoky chili kissing the palette. Slight mulled wine character is created, devoid of alcohol heat, smooth, lightly tickled with carbonation. Tour de (pours).    Up there with Speedway Stout - both top of the class as far as barrel-lacking stouts go - and beating its fellow hype-meme triumvirate rival Breakfast Stout in everything but price point.

Getting a subtle scent of coffee, chocolate. Not as big as some of the other big boy Imp stouts I've tried,    Holy Shee-ite. This is tasty. Coffee, cocoa, vanilla, and some heat from the ancho chili peppers to mask the alcohol perfectly. Goes down like a big stick of buttah! Absolutely creamy and smooth. Just top notch.    This one surpasses a lot of the big boys as far as Imp Stouts go. An absolute George Springer MVP kinda beer. Getcha sum!

L - Poured into a tulip, minimal foam that dissipated quickly.   S - Cocoa, vanilla, mild spices  T - Outstanding. High ABV is masked well, coffee, vanilla, and the chile peppers are just the right level of spiciness to give it an interesting finish.  F - A tad thin, I'd prefer a bit more carbonation - not sure if it's by age or design.  Overall, an outstanding imperial stout. Kind of surprised to find this here in Portland, ME but glad I did.

This is certainly a wonderful sipping stout. Not quite sublime, but wonderful.    Recommended if someone else is paying for it.

Taste is very similar with the bitterness of the cacao really pushing through. Can detect the presence at the end of the peppers but very smooth bite. Not overpowering. It's a well crafted beer. I do wish the vanilla shown through.

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.75 Finally got my hands on a bottle of the infamous Bomb! Consumed on my birthday.    Pours black as night with a tiny head. No lacing.    One of the best smelling beers I have ever come across. Raw coffee, vanilla, burnt caramel, butterscotch, cocoa and pepper skins. Absolutely beautiful with no alcohol detected. Opens up and intensifies as it warms.     Taste mimics the nose. Complex and deeply flavored. Well blended and freaking delicious. Finishes with a slight tickling on the back of the throat undoubtedly from the pepper.    Mouthfeel is a bit thin and the carbonation is low to non-existent. I wish this was thicker and fuller bodied. A bit more carbonation would be nice.     Glad I got to have this one. I can see why so many love this beer. It is special and well crafted. It has some minor flaws but still hits the mark. Highly recommend.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 I wonder what a BA version of this tastes like. I tried both the Nordaggios and the new version with Peruvian coffee. The ancho peppers stand out over everything else, in a good way. It's a good change of pace to the overly sweet stouts all over the market now. This is well rounded and the spiciness doesn't completely overpower. Great flavor.   
look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Rich, malty, chocolatey goodness. None of the expected burn or booziness expected at 13% abv. Will have to pick up a few more to enjoy now and some to cellar.

Taste is super balanced - sweet first, then bitter, then hot, but the overall experience is smooth and creamy.    Pairs well with Bodacious Onion Helluva Good dip and Aldi Vegetable chips.

The beer pours a cola like color with no highlights and a fleeting chocolate colored fizzy head. No lacing, no residual head. The aroma is coffee and some muted sweetness. Taste is semisweet chocolate and coffee first giving way to some subtle pepper heat and vanilla. Mouthfeel is full bodied, softly carbonated and undry. It's not cloying, in any way, but coats the tongue with flavors and hangs around. Bitterness is minimal as the pepper heat is used to balance the sweet malt, cocoa and vanilla. Overall, excellent. My only fault is in appearance as I wish this had head and lacing as beautiful as the rest of the beer.

But please guys.. once again no bottling date to be found.    Oh my, this is a tasty one! Heavily poured for a half finger of dark tan bubbly head that quickly dissipates to the outer rim of the black opaque body. Tons of coacoa nib on the nose, lots of deep-dark sweet coffee notes, traces of coconut, and the slight tickle of chili pepper. The vanilla seems pretty restrained here.  The taste is HUGE! Chocolatey, caramel, real roasty, sweetness from the milk chocolatey flavors and some reserved heat on the back from the chili peppers. It's oh so balanced, I don't feel that 13%abv heat at all. This brew has some nice prickly carbonation on the sides of the tongue accompanying the thick viscous onslaught of roasty coffee chocolate sweetness sip after sip.  This well met my expectations. Will seek it out again. I'll definitely be looking for the Pirate Bomb! if possible.

The smell and taste are pretty good but the taste is better on the grounds that i is more complex. The smell seems to be dominated by various notes such as vanilla beans and the ancho peppers. The peppers are slightly hot (but not burning) and give a good and interesting contrast to the other notes. The chocolate is more of a sweet powdered cocoa that gets lost among the other notes and comes off as a sweet chocolate syrup. The taste is pretty good and fairly interesting and a bit complex. The vanilla notes and chocolate syrup note are the dominant ones with a pepper undertone that adds a nice sweetness to it. It's definitely got some very interesting note.    The feel is pretty good. It's a heavy bodied beer but is pretty smooth and slightly creamy. The pepper gives it a nice burn and the carbonation enhances it slightly.    Overall, this is a fantastic beer and worth getting when possible. The beer's complexity works well as the different notes work together to create an interesting note.

Taste is very heavy on the milk chocolate with a moderate seeetness upfront then adds a touch of vanilla before the chile pepper heat takes over. Medium body with low+ carbonation that is somewhow a touch viscous. Overall this definitely grew on me, at first I didn't really get it but after a few sips the flavors came together and made for an interesting drinking experience.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Holy crap, the stout of stouts. This baby pours a deep dark obsidian with a thick root beer float colored head that persists very well. The smell is huge, chocolate and coffee notes, rich maltiness, toasted marshmallow, and all that stouty goodness. It's one downside is a hint of booziness. The taste delivers on the promise of the nose, chocolate and coffee are prominent and in your face. There are caramel notes, burnt marshmallow notes, not as much booze as in the nose, and a nice bitterness that keeps it from coating your tongue. And coat your tongue it does not, rich and robust bodied, it fills your mouth but leaves just the slightest residue on the tongue, just enough to remind you for minutes afterwards how badly you want another sip. Overall it definitely lives up to the hype, truly a stout to remember. The first reason I've heard in a long time to visit Oklahoma.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Traded for this a while back and finally got around to it on this muggy night. I've only had one beer from Prairie Artisan before but the few others that I've sampled in the Other Half line were winners. Guess what? This was too and ranked up there with the best Stouts that I've had such as the Old Rasputin and the Speedway. Rich and potent, I was glad that this came in a standard-sized beer bottle as finishing this off would have been tough if it was any bigger!    This had a nice, dark pour to it that looked and smelled like chocolate that was fermented. A thick mocha head topped it off as the big bubbles quickly settled down. Very little lacing left on the side of my pint glass, but that was the only drawback of this beer. The cacao nibs were strong in the aroma along with cocoa powder, milk chocolate, and a hint of lactose. More sweetness could be found in the amazingly smooth and silky taste that might have been the most easygoing of any beer that I've ever had with this much alcohol in it. Quite creamy, the peppers gave an initial burst of heat that quickly faded before an overall warming effect kicked in once this went down...    Still, I was amazing how little a buzz I felt from this given it's potency. I love chocolate and chili in a beer together and the old adage is that milk will take the burn out of your mouth if you've had too many peppers to handle. Maybe that's why this was so deceptively easygoing and delicious. Worth seeking out and having, any time of the year. This was good enough to put this brewery on the proverbial map for me!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 A: Deep, dark chocolate color, with a half-finger lighter khaki head, not a big head but it has good retention and pleasant, loose, lacing, the alcohol is a little bit clingy, but not as much as one would think given the ABV  S: as advertised, immediate chocolate and coffee, then comes the vanilla, then the vegetal-pepper aroma, in that order, excellent  T: not to short sell it, but...as advertised, and I mean that in a good way, this is not a subtle beer, it is the sum of its ingredients, blended phenomenally well, none of it is hard to pick out, you don't have to dig for it, it's right there, and it's excellent  M: Un-real. I mean it, it is viscous, but somehow light, almost floating around in the mouth. It's the first thing I noticed when I tasted the beer because it commands attention.   O: Lives up to the hype, really great. This beer is dangerously easy to drink for such a heavy beer. Second ever Prairie beer (had 'murica, didn't like it), it is amazingly good. Absolutely worth your time. Buy some to drink and some to keep, you're gonna want this around, believe me

L: Completely opaque black, three fourths of a finger width beige head recedes after a short time but leaves a good ring.     S: Espresso beans, with coffee, cocoa, some faint vanilla and the chili peppers bringing up the rear and nicely not overpowering.     T: Nice roasted flavor of coffee and espresso, good vanilla note in the middle ground that blends nicely into some milk chocolate flavors. The chili peppers are subtle enough to allow the other flavors to shine while maintaining a low amount of heat. Well done.     F: Medium body, lower carbonation, smooth and creamy.     O: An outstanding Imperial Stout and an excellent beer. Only thing that might make this tastier is a little BBA.

Head does not last very long, but tries to cling to the side of the glass. Smells of sweet expresso mixed with a dark coffee aroma, I also smell some spice which must be the peppers. Taste is extremely smooth, the cocoa as well as the strong dark malt is found quickly, the vanilla is clearly not an adjuct, but a serious ingredient. Everything seems to be blended excellently together engulfing the booziness into one of the last things that I notice.The peppers come off my breath slowly with ever sip. Very well done stout!

He held it in high regards so I figured it was worth a try. Looks dark with little head when poured. Smells like a typical breakfast stout. Great smell. Taste is thick! Chocolate notes all around, but still subtle. Prefer the taste of Founders Breakfast Stout but it is not near as strong as bomb. Smooth as could be for 13% .. All around great beer. Will try again.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 The appearance was a jet black color with a one finger white foamy head that dies immediately. Nice adequate slightly foamy lacing trying to cling to the glass, but spider webs for the most part. The smell had an espresso up front in a nice roasty sort of way backed up by some sweet milk chocolate and with a decent vanilla bean setting pervading my nose. The taste was mainly sweet that ends up leading to a decent balanced roasty sort of effect of a coffee grounds taste but not too bitter or bland as its spectacular and inviting. The aftertaste is basically a combined chocolatey/coffee flavoring with a quick dry finish. On the palate, well this one sits about a medium on the body that makes me want to sip this the more I taste it. Carbonation is good for the style as its fairly smooth and balanced to lead my mouth and tongue into a delicate sticky sweetness. Overall, though I don’t get the "peppery hotness" others do, I say, this is a pretty good brew well worthy of coming back.

Everything a stout should be with a hint of spice at the end which helps mask the alcohol beautifully. Excellent beer and a must try for any stout lover.

If I had to describe it to someone I imagine a cold brew coffee, with a shot of espresso with melted fudge and some carbonation. And alcohol of course.

The head has very little retention as it reduces to nothing as you drink and leaves behind very little lacing.    The aroma features bold coffee, vanilla beans, alcohol, chocolate, and Chile pepper spice.    As it warms the chocolate smell becomes stronger and the aroma is dominated by chocolate and coffee.    The taste features coffee and alcohol heat up front, followed by chocolate, roasted dark malts, and slight heat from the chile peppers. The finish is sweet vanilla. Alcohol is noticable and warming as you drink. The myriad flavors are well balanced.    Mouth feel is smooth as silk, full bodied and thick. Very nice.    Overall: Wow! I love stouts brewed in the "Mexican hot chocolate" style and this one is near perfect. It's well balanced, smooth, and oh so tasty!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours an inky black color with a thin brown head that fades to a ring around the glass.

Slight heat throughout and lingering afterwards. Good, solid feeling brew. Overall, very nice. At first I thought Stone Xocoveza with the smell so I was a bit thrown with the flavor. The chili peppers seem to make this very much their own brew. Would certainly have again.

Again lacks the coffee flavor described.   F: Medium thickness, not thick nor thin. Slight carbonation, slight dry finish  O: Solid year around beer.

Full, chewy, smooth as silk, mild warmth. 4.5     Coffee, cocoa, vanilla beans + Ancho chilis    Roughly 6 months on this one. Calibrated first with a thoroughly decent high proof Mexi-stout, Tempest Mexicake, so there’s no, “Oh, it’s strong and flavor!” love-at-first-sight things going on. And friends, that was wise, because Tempest is brandy and this is cognac.   Nose is deep, savoury, and ominous, like expensive cologne. Black malt character is far more complex, and the adjuncts deployed with much more finesse, and the chili is implied as much as tated. Cinnamon is missing + coffee added, so not a strict rendering of Mexican hot chocolate. This crucially tones down the whole spice angle, and the vanilla plays like it’s in, say, a creme brulee: you’d miss it if it were gone, but it’s not featured. Cocoa the same, only more so: I can’t even parse it from the dark malts. Roast, wisely, is quiet. Somehow manages to be smoother + less hot than Tempest in spite of 2% higher ABV (though age could’ve helped.) “This is about as far from overbearing and syrupy as an imperial stout can get,” says Kojevergas, and he’s not wrong.   Ultimately, I don’t even need to know that it’s a concept beer: stands very much on its own. Pairs well with banana bread. Totally get $10 a bottle, and given that I paid $6 for Mexicake, it might even be good a deal.    World class. 4.5

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bought a bottle at the Beer Shop in East Longmeadow, MA. The beer pours with a black appearance and a brown color head that quickly dissipates to form some patchy lacing on the sides. Aromas are very rich. They include the coffee notes mixed with what appeared to be mocha, malt, vanilla, some woody tones, and a peppery spice. The taste follows the nose with a medium boozy taste, almost like a vanilla rum flavor mixed with dark, black coffee. The beer is very creamy, which helps to give the flavors an alcohol warmth and dessert-feel. Overall, an incredible aroma characteristic makes way for other great variables, like taste and mouthfeel.

Kind of unusual for a stout of this ABV - lots of the aforementioned very lighter nuanced flavors.    Mouthfeel is light, ABV does not taste anywhere close to 13%, perhaps it's the peppers? Peppers hit you mostly in the finish.    Good. World class? Dear god no.

Started with some lacing but fades as the drink went down.     Smell- Lots of coffee with a hint of chocolate coming through. I am not a coffee person and it was too much for me. If you like coffee, I am certain you will rate this higher.     Taste- Lots more chocolate than I expected. The coffee was still there but not like I expected. The chocolate really gave it a nice sweet taste seemed like more than enough for this style. The real kicker was the chili pepper finish. Spicy is awesome.    Mouthfeel- Definitely a thick brew with a nice dry sort of finish.     Overall- I was looking for a nice strong beer on a cold night. Just sipped on this forever and the high ABV started to kick in. The peppers really set this one aside with the blended chocolate flavors. Great stout.

As you can guess the mouthfeel is slick. I enjoyed it nearly as much as Jackie O's Oro Negro and am glad I tried it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Right on the nose you get chocolate, vanilla, and chili peppers. The only smell that seemed lacking was the coffee. Was expecting a little more on that front, but the flavors that come through are fantastic.     It tastes like it smells, and I mean that in the best way. I get a little coffee but chocolate, vanilla and the chili peppers (which make this beer stand out from the rest) take the main seat. Wasn't sure how i felt about the chili peppers, but as this beer warmed up, I found that it shined.     In an age where BA Bourbon stouts seem to be king, the lack of bourbon is kind of refreshing. I appreciate it in the same way I appreciate Double shot. Be careful though, this beer does not taste like a 13%.     It's amazing that such a great beer is this easily accessible.

The amount of flavor is just over the top, and unexpected in many ways. For those used to stouts with huge malt and booze from bourbon barrels, the nuance in this one might knock your taste buds around. So delicious, so good, grab every bottle you see (even at ~$10 for a single 10 oz)!

Spotted lacing.  Aroma has more coffee than the flavor, but there is also roast malt and cacao.  Flavors are a complex combination of vanilla, roast malt, cacao, pepper, and coffee.  Mouthfeel is a very enjoyable silky smooth with a lingering cling while still being clean. Medium-full without being heavy.  A winner for sure.   
look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Look- Poured a black beer with no visible brown to it in my average every night beer drinking session with one dim light.    Smell- A soft vanilla smell that doesn't really stick to my nose. There is also a subtle hint of alcohol behind the initial smells.    Taste- More coffee that replaces the vanilla as the primary taste and the vanilla covers up over the taste of alcohol.    Feeling- A noticeable kick from the alcohol content in this and there is a little bit of carbonation with only a little tickle to it.    Overall- Very highly rated drink in my opinion.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Appropriate color, very thin head & lacing. Aroma is a fairly pleasant mixture of mild coffee, semi-bitter cacao and chille pepper, though the pepper begins to dominate as it opens up which was disappointing after the initial quaff. Touch of medium South American coffee upfront with some verdant pepper underneath (though less noticeable than on the nose). Mid-palate really shifts more towards the semi-bitter chocolate though the vanilla helps masks it a little & leaves more of a residual milk chocolate. Coffee and pepper are still there but nicely joined with the other flavors, and the coffee pokes in at the end with a bitter wash. None of the flavors are too bombastic, and while I am not a pepper-in-beer guy this one is pretty tastey.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 I guess I don't gravitate towards spicy beverages, and this one is a bit more peppery than I'd prefer. The smell gives off a weird peppery Italian food scent, so I guess the red peppers come through strong. The flavor is vanilla, milk chocolate, and just a hint of chili, less strong than the smell implies. Also, it's crazy smooth for 13% abv. It's peculiar but tasty. I won't go out of my way for it, but I'll happily give it another shake.

I smell coffee right off the bat. As I stuck my nose in for further discovery I could smell some chili peppers. I smell some chocolate too.    Now the taste is more coffee and chocolate with the peppers in the background. The vanilla adds a little sweetness.    Full mouthfeel with low carbonation    This is a delicious beer. It is one of the rare beers that lives up to the hype. I don't recommend holding on to it for over a year though.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pour from single bottle into a tulip.    Pours a nearly-black and opaque (not kind of opaque--inky opaque) with a surprisingly good foamy root-beer colored head and outstanding sticky lacing.    Aromas of bitter coffee and chocolate very forward, with notes of smoke, spice, vanilla, and a hint of pepper    The taste follows the nose quite well, and is fantastic. However, the roasted malts are very forward, and the brew is dangerously close to being too sweet. There is just enough carbonation, booziness, and pepper heat to balance it out.    This is a fairly full-bodied brew, with a nice dry finish.    Overall, this is well worth the ratings it's received, and I would recommend to anyone that wants to foray into the Mexican chocolate beer market.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Pours black. Quarter finger of head    Vanilla,cherries, chocolate, tobacco, leather on the nose. Smoky malt. Some alcohol.    Chocolate forward. A little fruitiness in the middle - like aged dried cherries. Vanilla bean on the back end. Some heat from the chillies quickly followed by the burn from the alcohol. Considering its 13 percent alcohol well hidden. But I can feel it heating my chest and stomach.    I like this beer, but feel it's overrated. Definitely a 9 beer. But not as perfect as the aggregate score indicates.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Absolutely fantastic stout. Vanilla and spices stand out in the smell and taste. The after taste is a tad bit spicy, which really makes this a fantastic stout. Very similar to Westbrook's Mexican Cake. Very dark brown body, nearly black. One of the best stouts around, no dout about it.

Beer poured blacked with a nice tan head that is leaving some lacing.    Nose is roasted chilies, vanilla, coffee, and chocolate.    Initial taste was a medium dose of hot chilies on the back of the throat. Subsequent sips reveal vanilla coffee with a hint of chocolate finishing with the chili warmth.    Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied and smooth.    Overall a very tasty brew that is definitely worth seeking out!

The aromas are very nice. Lots of milk chocolate with some hints of vanilla cream. Subtle hints of caramel. Cocoa malts are there. The coffee aromas are subtle. The flavors are very bold and rich. Lots of rich milk chocolate. The coffee becomes more alive in the flavor department. It finishes with a nice spice kick due to the chili peppers. Hints of vanilla in the mix. Solid cocoa malt backbone. It finishes slightly warm, mostly due to the peppers, but the alcohol is well hidden. It's dangerously drinkable. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's velvety and creamy without being super thick. Very smooth and fun to drink. Once again, this is dangerously drinkable. It doesn't drink like it's 13% abv at all.    This is a great imperial stout. Great aromas and flavors. All of the adjuncts blend well together. The craftsmanship is very impressive. It's a little pricey, but it's really good.

Tastes of vanilla, snow, thick caramel, maple syrup, marshmallow, and coffee.     Thick like a milk shake, little carbonation, its marshmallow like going down, like the melted ones on top of hot chocolate!    Fantastic brew! Got this one at Wholefoods in Davis, California in September. Drinking it today in Chiang Mai, Thailand.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured this thick beast into a snifter. A small, late head fizzes up, then back down to the smallest of rings. A faint dust of lace. Black, black color.     Nose is roast, bitter cocoa, and a hint of chili. A vanilla sheen overlaps as well.     Cocoa roast, unbelievably smooth thanks to vanilla. Chili and cocoa bitterness linger on the end, with creamier chocolate notes.     Smooth as a silky viscous stout could be. A peppery finish suggests the chili, and leaves its heat in the back of the throat.     Probably the most celebrated craft beer from the Sooner State, and quite worthy of its praise. Bomb! is a stout's stout.

Packaging is a huge part of being a good brewery, so the rating should reflect the fact that I got a poorly packaged product.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 BOMB! is a slightly viscous, effervescent, near-impenetrably black beer that shows mahogany footlights and a thin, rocky tan head that leaves scant, fast-retreating blotches of lacing. The nose is medium-large: a tasty blend of molasses, cocoa and black coffee with more subtle baker's chocolate, hints of exotic spice, and insistent alcohol overtones with a faint solvent-like fusel character. The flavor is a seamless blend of molasses, dark caramel and milk chocolate, with more subtle cocoa notes and hints of a cayenne-like vegetal character; all of this is undercut by a significant boozy undertow. Overall, it lands just about on the balance point in terms of sweet vs. bitter. The finish is a good hit of molasses and alcohol, followed by the onset of a mild, boozy chocolate-and-coffee flavor and a modest capsaicin burn, both of which last for a good while. Retrogustative olfaction is decidedly boozy. Mouthfeel is commensurate with the extra-full body, and is warming from both the alcohol and the capsaicin; the texture is sticky/creamy and slightly peppery from the well-expressed carbonation.

On point for the style. Sparse but intricate lacing. Weaker head which disappears after a couple minutes. Minimal lacing.    Taste: Roasted malts with chocolate, coffee, some nice vanilla beans and almost undetectable chili peppers.     I cannot BELIEVE this mofo has 13% in it. I've tasted beers half as strong with more bitterness. Absolutely none at all. This beer could get you in trouble bahaha. Every sip is full of love. Licorice? GODLY beer here.    The feel is extremely full bodied, washing down smooth and easy. Just a little dry but leaves the palate wet and panting for more. Malts are the most balanced and rewarding I've had in the style. This is the highest retad beer I have on here for a reason.    Damn I love this beer and you will too. Price is high but the quality is THERE     Cheers. This beer makes my mouth water. At a month old (warning their bottle date is extremely hard to read) and I don't even know if they're using Julian dating but I know it's about a month old. Fucking awesome beer.

The head is a thin, short lived tan affair that leaves zero lacing.    The nose is sweet maltiness alcohol, coriander, nutmeg, vanilla, apples, cinnamon, chocolate and coffee with hints of over ripe dark cherries.    The taste is a competing sweet malt with dryness, they battle for dominance. the sweet quickly fades leaving a dryer stout that is mixing it up with alcohol, raisins, chocolate, apricots that fall off to a fairly clean finish.    The mouthfeel is rich and heavy as expected for the style.    Overall a very pleasant stout, just a bit pricey when there are others that are equal or better. I recommend at least trying it.

T - Taste almost identical to the smell. First chocolate, then notes of med roast coffee, then a chili pepper kick on the back end, I couldn't pick up the vanilla.  F - Smooth and chewy. It was drinkable but it didn't feel like a beer.   O - I'll note that I am probably one of the few people who really don't like porters / stouts. Having said that, I wasn't completely turned off by this and I think the brewer did a nice job with incorporating the different flavor profiles. It just didn't drink like a beer for me and I am not sure if I would try again.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours jet black with a 1 finger quickly dissipating tan head.    Smell is mostly cacao with just a hint of chili and booze.    Taste is much more complex than the smell. Getting all kinds of vanilla,carmel sugary goodness then a bit of big chili flavor hits mid palate with a nice dark bakers chocolate type finish .    Feel is full bodied but certainly not thick or oily like you get with a lot of imperial stouts, still very silky tho.    Overall this is a damn good beer I will drink again at some point but maybe a little high on price .

If you gave me the body of Xocoveza with the taste from BOMB! I would have given it a perfect score. The other thing I got to factor in is the price. I can get a 6 pack of Xocoveza for around $15 and a 12oz of BOMB! runs me $11. Still very glad I tried this guy though but probably won't buy it again.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 An excellent imperial stout, hitting all the right notes, with some good extra spins. The ancho peppers, in particular, take it to another level. As is, it fits the same character of a lot of great stouts, just done very well: roasted malts, vanilla, chocolate, check. The residual heat and slight vegetable flavor from the anchos, though, just really add a ton. Well deserving of its reputation.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Poured from the 12oz bottle into a snifter leaving some room to swirl it on the glass. Pours jet black with an inch of beautiful, stable, brownish head that dissipated slowly and left plenty of lacing and foam on the sides of the glass. Beautiful in the glass. Smell is of coffee, then chocolate, mocha, and oatmeal. only complaint on the nose, is I pick up the slightest metallic smell. Taste is spot on! Same qualities you pick up in the nose, minus the metallic hint, and all more pronounced, with the full pat body carrying everything through and creating a full palate of very.. well, breakfasts flavors! Cold brew, mocha, bittersweet cocoa, a touch of caramel sweetness, and a full mouthfeel.

The aromas blend and intensify with warming.    Good bitterness and the chili comes through subtly but it doesn't overwhelm the  balance of the beer.    Taste is phenomenal. One of the better imperial stouts. Unquestionably loaded with roasted  coffee, chocolate and cacao flavor. An overtone of spice,    One of the better imperial stouts out there and in the top class.  BCBS is more layered and a different approach- this beer is on the spicy heavy roasted coffee end.  Prairie finally started to distribute in my area and we are seeing more of their beer.  Will buy more.

Pouring a jet black with a dense, dark brown head with excellent retention and lacing, this looks great! The nose is quite excellent. Very clearly a coffee-forward imperial stout, though the addition of the chili peppers, which add a heat and flavor that bring to mind green peppercorns, The coffee character is rather fruity with dark roast. There's a rich malt flavor with cocoa, roast and the vanilla pairs nicely with the rest of the nose. The cacao nibs are whelmed by the coffee and the pepper, so their distinctive flavor is slightly lost here. Still, this is impressive. The palate opens with a blend of caramel sweetness, a touch of dulce de leche, plenty of coffee and cacao before a mild heat becomes noticeable. Fruity coffee with green peppercorns, mildly vegetal, with this character growing towards the finish. Sweet on the finish with vanilla and caramel with cocoa and coffee. The pepper character is mildly smoky as well. Alcohol is well hidden in this full bodied beer that's softly carbonated and quite wonderfully creamy on the palate. The pairing of the sweeter, more malt and milk chocolate like flavors up front with the darker roast and coffee on the mid-palate is intriguing.     This beer is almost fantastic - the flavor notes are there, the integration is almost there and the vision is clear. Highly recommended.

Huge nose, very sweet. Time has whittled the peppers and spices to just a hint on the finish. Want to try this much closer to the bottling date to see if non-chocolate flavors are more prominent.

The body is fine, but without a head, it is not your typical stout.    S - Huge nose of alcohol, big roast with nut and wood, a bit of pepper warmth, chocolate, brownie. Yum.    T - Open is chocolate and full, a quick drop to the middle with a sharp bitter bite, and a slow pepper warmth in the close.    M - Amazing feel, moderate and slick, so much easier than most beers at this ABV. This is the real stand-out characteristic.    O - I cannot say I love pepper infused stouts. But this is one well built version, with a great flavor open, and a feel that makes this a real treat to drink.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25 Total Wine Boynton Beach $10    Pours thick as oil with that ominous appearance big stouts seem to carry.     Nose is coffee, toffee, molasses, and that vanilla/oak character. No noticeable chili presence at first pass    Slight chili heat on the palate, especially the finish as it warms up. More molasses and coffee than I expected and certainly some vanilla. Pretty damn balanced with that subtle hop bitterness. Booze as it warms    Wow this is smooth! Definitely not expecting such a perfect feel to this given the ABV and nose    Overall, very smooth for a high ABV beer. Would definitely seek out again    Think a boozy and spicy Breakfast Stout, if you are one for comparisons

It has such a creamy and full mouthfeel! The flavors work wonderfully together in this complex beer. With so many flavors, it's easy to see why they call it BOMB!!

Price: $8.00  Purchased: Dec. 15, 2016  Consumed: Dec. 15, 2016  Reviewed as: American Double / Imperial Stout  Misc.: N/A    Went to this place with the intention of trying and reviewing two barrel-aged stouts. This was after eight 4-oz. tasters each at Craft Haus and Bad Beat. Decided on Even More Jesus and Bomb! over a Russian Imperial Stout from Joseph James. Was looking forward to finally trying this one. Would be disappointed with anything below a 4.30.    Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of frothy tan head. Excellent spiderweb lacing. Good retention. (Sight - 4.25)    Smelled chile peppers, dark roasted chocolate, dark cocoa, vanilla and some hints of coffee. (Smell - 4.25)    Tasted milk chocolate, chocolate syrup, cocoa, vanilla, caramel, spices coming in late and brownie batter. (Taste - 4.50)    Full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, slightly spicy warming finish. (Feel - 4.75)    This was about as good as I could have hoped. Glad I got to try it and can’t wait to have it again. (Overall - 4.50)    4.45 | 99 | A

A rough pour yielded a small tan head which quickly dissipated; minimal lace.     Dark chocolate, roasted coffee bean, sweet cream & faint raspberry notes in the nose.     Thick, creamy mouthfeel.     Dark chocolate, roasted coffee bean & sweet cream flavors up front; a hint of smoke & VERY faint pepper heat notes on the finish. No booze heat. A delicious, rich, dangerously drinkable treat. Bravo!

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I'm not a dark beer fan but this is by far one of the best dark beer I've ever had. It pours dark with a dark tan head it smells and taste like coffee and dark chocolate and is very smooth. Mouth feel is nice not to thick or carbonated. It is a tad expensive I paid $6.99 for one bottle but my curiosity had got the best of me.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 On-tap served in a pint glass at O’glee, Bangkok. Also had a bottle brewed with Spaceship Earth coffee.    It comes black as night in color with one finger of frothy dark tan head that stands with pretty decent retention before gradually sinking to some bubble on the surface, lots of lacing patch and spot left on the glass-side.    Very rich and intense espresso coffee, cocoa, dark and milk chocolate, sweet vanilla, brown sugar, and caramel aromas as well as some roasted and bready notes. Those scents are nicely infused with a crisp chili spice and hint of dark cherry and subtle alcohol to create a very inviting aroma.    Sweetness upfront through the palate sensation with notes of sweet vanilla, caramel, and brown sugar. Then it is roasted malt and coffee as well as dark and creamy chocolate while chili lends its moderate spice and heat adding up some depth. Alcohol is there but it is quite hidden with just a slight warming touch.    Bold and full body with sticky and chewy mouthfeel through the palate, anyway, it is crisp and lively enough to carry all the things well even with low carbonation. Finish is pleasantly dry.    Superb Stout with solid coffee, cocoa, and chocolate profile, its alcohol content will make you feel the heat as well as chili, complex and hefty but truly great.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Pours a brown so deep that it appears to be shoe polish black. The pour produces barely half a finger of frothy, very shortlived, deep mocha head that leaves only a hint of a collar ring & no lace. A very mundane look for such an otherwise outstanding brew. Aroma is deeply roasted malts, dark chocolate, chili pepper, caramel, toffee, coffee, alcohol booze & a hint of smoke. Taste is deeply roasted coffee, cold & spent coffee grounds, burnt dark malts, spicy chili pepper (ancho?), dark chocolate syrup, alcohol booze & smoke with hints of dark fruit. Fronted by chili pepper spice, dark roast/burnt malts, semi-sweet dark cocoa & smoke mingling & riding into the prickly finish where they are joined by dark fruit transitioning into an earthy, coffee, chocolate, slightly bitter, & pepper prickly burnt aftertaste. Alcohol is evident in warmth, flavor & maybe bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with weak carbonation, the pepper spice pricklinesscould be confused for carbonation bite that manifests as a crawling spicy, prickly bite, tongue coating creamy & chewy. As is usual with many such brews this one improves in flavor as it warms. It is certainly a top end example of an imperial Stout chili beer. Well done!

Not very thick though.    O- Probably one of the best stouts that's regularly on the shelf. Admittedly the price ($10 for 12 oz) is a good chunk of the reason.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5 L: Pitch black with a foamy, brown head that dissipated pretty quickly, as expected, but leaves a thin ring that leaves splotchy tan lacing.    S: Dark roast coffee, like espresso, most prominent, with a massive backbone of bittersweet dark chocolate that compliments the roast of the coffee. The spices are subtle, but faint hints of chili pepper and cinnamon are there in the background to tingle the nostrils.     T: Upfront, it tastes like mocha as the coffee, chocolate, and vanilla beans meld together for rich, creamy experience. As it moves on to the middle of your tongue, the chocolate and coffee express themselves fully, a rich, bittersweet dark chocolate compliment by the roastiness of the espresso and coffee that cuts through the chocolaty sweetness. On the back of the palate, the vanilla beans come back, smoothing things out. Then on the finish, you're hit with the cinnamon and chili peppers, but they are not overpowering. There is some alcohol warmth, but it very well hidden for 13%, and the heat melds with the cinnamon and chili peppers for a warming sensation. Finishes cleaner than expected, with a slightly bitter cacao aftertaste and tingling hints of the cinnamon and chili peppers, begging for the next sip.    F: Not super thick or chewy, but a medium-full bready feeling. It glides easily across the palate, with just enough slickness to coat the mouth with all the flavors.    O: This is the best Mexican hot chocolate-inspired stout I've had thus far. The spices are more subtle, which is my personal preference, and they serve simply to compliment the rest of the stout. However, the coffee and cacao nibs are phenomenal in this one, and I love me some coffee in beer. The sheer drinkability is insane. This is a world-class beer.

Interestingly i do not smell the 13% booziness. PAT yourself on your backs for that. If that was what u all were going for, you did it. Don't smell the pepper like the stone's Xocoveza.   Taste: in my selfish humble opinion...OFF The HOOK !  On taste i get the coffe chocolate and pepper. Interestingly the pepper smell did not come out but on the taste it did but not strong, it arrives as a blend with the coffee and chocolate.   Feel: as all my reviews the feel is private and personal, go away (LOL!)  Overall: I want another one! I think that says it all, i want another one.    OK OK..in my humble opinion, this beats stone's Xocoveza.   Sorry stone. But this is my subjective palate.  Djkman

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pour from a bottle into my Four Firkins snifter. Pours a ridiculously thick, very dark brown color. The liquid itself appears to be as thick as I've ever seen, having motor oil like qualities in color and appearance. A moderate sized head dissipates quickly, leaving nothing but a small ring of lacing around the edge.    Oh my, the aroma. Deep, vivid chocolate and burnt coffee malts. Very strong.    Smooth, bitter, and a bit of a bite. Very complex flavor. Cacao nibs and hints of vanilla are mostly there, but it's dominated by the same notes from the aroma of a blend of dark and milk chocolate. I'm getting some notes of dark fruits on the back end. The finish is sweet and bitter, some might consider it overly-so and possibly harsh. I think it's a beautiful touch to a wonderful winter brew.    As drinkable as it gets at 13% ABV. Sweet, but not too much warmth or bite from the alcohol.    Overall, an excellent winter beer worthy of all the praise it received. I can see some people disliking it's sweetness,but it works for me. Would really like to try aging this one.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 3.25 Pours super thick and dark, tiny little twister of bubbles at the end. Took for ever for this to warm up in my room. I drank more of it than I should of before it reached optimal temp. DEF want this to warm up to get the full taste. On the nose I'm blasted with coffee and chocolate. It kind of reminds me of smelling a flavored dunkin donuts or starbucks drink. Tasting it, you get rich bold flavor, but it's extremely sweet. lots of coacoa, vanilla sweetness, don't really get too much of a kick from the peppers. This beer is pretty yummy, but it sort of feels some where in between drinking a syrup'd out starbucks latte and drinking the most choclatey bottom of a milk-shake. Althought packed with rich flavors, something about the overt-candy rush vibe of this beer doesn't feel right. It's like some hipster donut in beer form.    note: this is the 2016 batch that just came out, maybe next time I get a chance to grab a bottle I will try to wait a couple years before trying it.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a 12oz bottle,into a Prairie Artisan Ales snifter.    Aggressive pour led to a 1 finger dark khaki,and dark brown mottled head,with large to medium bubbles.Very light carbonation.Jet black in color,with absolutely no light coming through the glass.The head leaves a nice looking ring around the glass,with a spider web lacing in the center.Eventually that dissipates into nothing.Sipping leaves a beautiful lacing on the side of the glass.    The nose is chocolate,coffee,cocoa,and a little bit of peppers,ending with slight alcohol aromas.I also get little bit of earthy roasted malts,along with some slight hints of vanilla.    The palate follows the nose with strong black coffee,cocoa,some dark chocolate,and dark roasted malt.You get a little bit of pepper,but nothing offensive to me.I think the slight hint of peppers on the back end,does a beautiful job of hiding the alcohol.You also get a nice warming alcohol feel on the finish,which makes it a good beer for drinking in the cold.    The body is medium,but slightly sticky.You get a slight tingling sensation of peppers,and alcohol on the way down.Medium dry finish.    This is a very good imperial stout.The flavors are very well balanced,and the pepper does an excellent job of masking the alcohol...Looks,smells,tastes,and feels GREAT!!! This is in my top 3 favorite imperial stouts...Excellent brew!!!!

This is loaded with the aroma of peppers and taste of peppers but sadly there is zero heat. I can't decide if I don't like it or if it's straight up a gross mix of a salad and a beer.    Addendum - halfway through it became obnoxious sweet and difficult to considered drain pouring. However since I'm a fan a real pepper beers I added a habernero hot sauce I have before added to sub par IPA's.     Re-rate of a fresh bottle on 7-21-17    Looks frothy, thick, creamy. 4.25.    Smells standard mole stout. Heavy cinnamon, greenish pepper, faint heat, faint vanilla, oak. - 4    Taste is hello chocolate. Milk chocolate mostly then semi sweet chocolate then dark chocolate, then cinnamon, cherry and pepper heat. Fuck. I regret drinking my first one so old from a washed up trade. This is legimately stellar without any age on it. (NOTE - do not age this or it will taste like green pepper cinnamon oatmeal). 4.5    F - average on viscosity. It's very alcohol laden and spicy both in heat and burn. Carbonation I suppose is on the side of "chewy" 4.25    Overall 4.25. Exceptional but not unrivaled.

What you would expect from the aroma but the sweet booze takes over a little more than I would like.   F: Thick and full but almost abrasively warming from the high alcohol.   O: Very very good but stouts that get into this range of abv can be a little too aggressive for myself.

Insane melted chocolate, peppers, vanilla, cherry, amaretto, coffee, lactose.    Flavor is more of the same but chili forward yet amazingly not overdone. Coffee and chocolate pop up in between bites of chili. A firm, roasty finish takes place.    Feel is slick and semi thick but not as thick as id like. Only let down here.    Overall, what a great beer. Now I know what I was missing.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Very good but compares unfavorably to Stone Xocoveza IMO. They do a good job with all of the Mexican chocolate type flavors, chocolate cinnamon and chilI. But it's rougher and harsher and the 13% abv is obvious. I caught a slight cigarette taste and Aroma as well. Letting it warm up for 10 minutes really ups the quality. At ten bucks a bottle I won't be going for this any time the Stone or Cigar City Mexican choc beers are in circulation.

Slick mouthfeel, brightly fizzy on the front.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Look - pitch black, great head with some mocha color. Not see through but no visible sediment    Smell - semi sweet chocolate, coffee, toffee, hints of vanilla bean ice cream. Basically when starbucks grows up, this is the cologne/perfume it will wear    Taste - all of thee above plus hints of black pepper and serrano on the back on the tongue during the finish. Tiny bit of earthy hops midway through, but barely noticeable. Mainly sweet dark charred notes.    Feel - thick and luscious. Leaves an espresso taste long after the swallow, much like an Americano or a double shot. Alcohol is noticeable but not overpowering.     Overall - one of the best readily available heavy stouts on the market. Not cheap, but worth every penny. 12 Oz is the perfect serving.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Pour: looks black as night, a typical stout. Little to no head. If you're lucky you'll get a bit of tan off the head which will be gone like a fart in the wind.    Smell: Smells like coffee grounds, earthy soil after a rainstorm, cocoa powder, madagascar vanilla beans, and a touch of cayenne.     Taste: Mother of god, this caos of a combination humbly harmonizes. Right up front a touch of milk, then roasted toffee, caramel, and vanilla to linger. Most importantly the subtly peppers give you a bit of a palate awakening and invite the next sip.    Body: The body is almost a bit of a throw off. It's not at all as heavy as the nose and taste would lead you to believe. At times it is watery, like a guinness. Abv is well hidden, almost untraceable.    Overall, this is a fantastic stout. I hope they do not sell out to major corporate beer and produce this for the masses on a commercial scale. This is just perfect. It's not as hard to find as pliny or another hyped up beer, but you will find this occasionally in your local craft store. This should be enjoyed to the rest of the country as a specialty like christmas, and to the locals as their own. Just a wonderful beer. cheers.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 From a bottle. Solid black with a thin tan head. Smell is light stone fruit. Taste smooth chocolate and coffee, some late ripe stone fruit. Very slight bitterness to balance. Maybe some mild heat from the chilis. Feel is silky slick, low carb, not chewy thick, but in no way thin. Booze is present of course, but would not guess 13%. Overall an excellent beer, but with these big stouts, I always compare to a BBA, and I find the non-aged ones lacking a bit. Also, at $10 per single 12 oz I doubt I will be buying many

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12oz bottle. 9/9/14 production date. Appearance: Black, opaque, with a brown head that dissipates quickly. Aroma: Rich coffee roast, dark chocolate, some dark cherry, grass, pepper, and a touch of cardboard oxidation Taste: Starts with a rich coffee roast and dark chocolate, quickly turning to a moderately strong, grassy, chili pepper that delivers some heat, and a moderately strong bitterness that’s accentuated by the pepper spice. Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy bodied with some syrupy consistency, and low carbonation. Surprising that the alcohol warmth isn’t noticeable considering it’s 13%. Finish: Leaves a chocolate and coffee roast bitterness on the finish, with some lingering chili heat. Overall: If I had to sum this up I’d say it’s a coffee pepper imperial stout. Strong coffee roast character throughout, and the chili pepper adds a significant heat and vegetal/grassy flavor. For an imperial stout of this strength the alcohol isn’t noticeable and the dark fruit character is nonexistent. An interesting beer, but not sure I would buy a 2nd.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a tulip    Aroma: tobacco and green olives with a mixture of bittersweet and milk chocolate, cedar and vanilla.    Appearance: black - 10 W30. Head is a light tan with microscopic bubbles that fades quickly to a very long lasting lacing at the edge of the glass.     Flavor: many layers and flavors, all woven into a beautiful tapestry. No one flavor dominates: the vanilla and coffee combine wonderfully. The chilis are barely detectable and there is only the very mildest of heat, which would probably go unnoticed without the mention of chilis on the label. Very good.     Mouthfeel: medium, but surprisingly light given the 13% abv. You can easily drink a few of these.    Overall: Very good and worthwhile, but I feel the overall BA score is greater than deserved by this beer. This beer is approaching BCBS' BA score, but BCBS is the much superior imperial stout. Certainly try this beer given the opportunity, though.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a snifter. Opaque brown-black color with a thin light-tan head. Little retention or lacing. Striking aromas: cocoa, chili powder, cinnamon, coffee, and vanilla - as advertised! The first sip brought coffee initially, followed by vanilla, milk chocolate, roasted malt, and a sturdy, warming chili spiciness which lingered on the finish. This balanced the heat from the alcohol perfectly. A fantastic beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Moderate one finger head which steadily simmers down, dark tan or light brown, take your pick, very even surface, the lacing slides around the glass in broad sheets, eventually spilling downwards. Black liquid yet not so opaque that you can’t see the bubble beads, no color tint at the edges. Spicy nose with the chili pepper making the initial splash, at times almost green and leafy with a wet fur edge, oily tar, the chocolate seems dense enough as to be inert, burnt coffee, close to zero fruit scent presence, quite interesting yet not immediately pleasurable. Full-bodied, viscously thick and layered, here the sweetness of the chocolate and vanilla is on full display, all confectionery goodness. The chili spice there but more proportionate, bringing heat for balance. Coconut, cafe con leche and a hint of witch hazel. Not much movement from the carbonation, just a tickle under the tongue. The pepperiness lingers the most through the finish. Avoids both excess booziness and needless showiness, for its scale and level of richness displays good agility. One bottle is the perfect size for a single sitting.

Look pours completely black with a nice brown head that settles out and leaves lots of lacing behind.   Smell is amazing coffee, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, and just a hint of chili peppers.  Taste is amazingly complex, starts out boozy, settles into a bit of ancho pepper, than finishes with vanilla beans and chocolate. The only better taste is when this is rum barrel aged i.e. Pirate Bomb.   Mouthfeel is smooth, full, and complex. Let this one sit and warm for a bit - doesn't get much better.    Absolutely incredible brew. Find you one or trade me for some!

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 3.5 355ml bottle into a Spiegelau Stout glass. Paid £10.75 for a single bottle.    Pours an opaque, inky black body, that when held to the light allows some dark ruby glimmers to be observed near the edges of the glass. A dense and creamy, one-finger in height, light tan coloured head with excellent retention slowly reduces to a thin film and collar, leaving behind small amounts of soapy lace.    The rich and full nose leads initially with a combination of lightly roasted dark malts, sweet toasty grains and milk chocolate. Darker, earthy notes of dry, bitter cocoa powder and hints of smoke, ash and char are noticeable underneath. The finish reveals restrained chilli pepper heat and spice, along with vanilla and traces of fusel alcohol sweetness. Taste roughly follows suit. Lightly roasted dark malts, coffee beans and baking chocolate are sweetened considerably by creamier milk chocolate, roasted grains, vanilla and hints of burnt caramel, Mid palate, ancho chilli peppers enter with a little more presence than the nose suggested. Although moderately hot and spicy, lingering malt sweetness and vanilla soften the edges to deliver a pleasantly smooth and subtle warming profile overall. In the mouth, a medium to full body pairs well with a liberal amount of fine carbonation, present just enough to aid drinkability without effecting the luxuriously rich, smooth and creamy feel. Towards the back-end, espresso, dry earthy roasted dark malts, cocoa, smoke, vanilla, caramelised sugars and chilli spices linger to give a lengthy bittersweet finish. Traces of alcohol and roast combine, drying the palate slightly, while capsaicin oils bring faint and pleasant warmth to the lips, throat and chest.    Overall this is an excellent beer. Rich, flavourful, well balanced and insanely drinkable, despite the substantial 13.0% ABV. Its alcoholic content in fact, is so masterfully disguised, I had to remind myself to slow down and savour the taste after quickly consuming nearly half the glass. As both a beer I’ve wanted to get my hands on for a very long time and a rare find in the UK, the price I paid seems fair enough. Despite meeting expectations however, now that I have tried it, at £10.75 a single, realistically I can’t see myself picking up another unless it was for a very special occasion.

Look: Completely pitch black, with a thin ring of dark tan lacing present.    Smell: Hot chilies, cocoa, coffee grounds all in the aroma, which has a slight vegital tinge.    Feel: On the heavier side of medium, with mild carbonation. great mouthfeel.    Taste: Spicy chilies bring on head initially on the palate, but soon replaced by sweet coffee, chocolate, and caramel.   Finishes with a mild spicy/sweet flavor.    Overall: Been wanting to try this for a while now, and finally spotted it at the beer store. I can say it was definitely worth the wait. This is up there with the best; words cannot describe how it is. It combines my favorite styles of chile beer, and stouts.

A thin, short-lived head of brown foam rests on top. Huge nose. Definite coffee, peppermint, lactose, spicy chiles, and a touch of vanilla. Smells delicious - one of the best smelling beers I've had in a long time. On the taste, I get a butt load of coffee and chocolate up front with strong backing notes of vanilla and cream. After a second or two, the chiles creep in and make their presence known. Not too strong, but strong enough. The mouthfeel is perfect. Thick, dense, milky, but not overly chewy. This sum'bitch is as balanced as one could hope for.    I've been waiting to try this for a long time and it didn't disappoint. Perfectly balanced, incredibly tasty, and quite unique. Is it worth the price? Not on a regular basis, but it's worth picking up at least once. Great beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Looks like light motor oil. I've seen darker.     Smells great. Chocolate roasted malt, vanilla. Impressive for a not barrel aged beer.     Tastes slightly better tan it smells. The peppers are subtle but are the balancing factor that make this beer sofa king good!    Mouthfeel is spot on. Not syrupy but still a mouthful.     Overall... One of the  Best ever. Stone IRS plus more flavor. My fav non-barrel aged stout! Great job PAA

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Purchased at Liquor Shed in Casper, ~$11.    Pours pitch black, small head of tan foam, some lacing.     Roasted malt, coffee, vanilla, semi sweet chocolate, cocoa nibs...the aromas eminating from my glass are almost overwhelming!    Taste of cocoa nibs and roasted malt way up front. Coffee and vanilla not far behind as is the alcohol. Oooh baby, this is a bad boy. The finish is a bitter sweet thing with lots of warming. I'd be remiss to not mention the heat that the chilies add to the equation. They're responsible for a good heap of the warming going on.     Full bodied with medium carbonation.     I only rated it the last time I drank it. So glad that it's available locally now so I can rectify a wrong. ;)

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Pours a deep mahogany color with a tight, mocha head that leaves little bits of lacing.    Smells of deep roasted notes of cocoa and coffee mostly.    Tastes of the deep roasted notes layered with some vanilla. Malt notes of semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, and molasses lead off with plenty of sweetness. This gives way to some vanilla notes. Chilis are more noticable as it warms. Next comes some earthy hops as well as roasted bitterness. Finishes with a lingering roasted coffee note.    Mouthfeel is full with a smooth amount of carbonation.    Overall, this is a brilliant Imperial Stout. I could do without the chilis, but it does fit well.

Love the mild spiciness at the back end. Mouthfeel is quick and creamy. Just a fantastic beer. Would (and will) get again when I have the chance.

The chili never tires and provides a very recomforting warming. To enjoy in short sips. Avg 4.78    12 Aug 2018. From Cervezalandia. In Teku glass. Playing Avadon 3. After the deconstruction comes the reconstruction, and Ive found that the chilly, although not overwhelming, hides the other ingredients

Dark like used motor oil with good-sized brown head that sticks around. Wonderful aroma with muted chocolate, coffee and dark malt. Taste is also excellent - with just a hint of chili. Mouthfeel is just how I like big stouts, not too thick and viscous - still a sipper, but easy to finish the whole bottle. Overall, one of the better stouts I've had. Love it.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 12 ounce bottle, undated. Poured into Carton O-Dub glass.    L: 2F light tan head, no retention as the ABV knocks it right away, leaving a tiny ring and cap. Beer is as dark as can be.    S: Lots of coffee up front, some cocoa, vanilla, caramel malts, and a hint of chili. No alcohol in nose, which at 13% is a heck of an accomplishment.    T: Coffee, cocoa, then vanilla, caramel malt, and then chili at the finish, but just a little bit. The cocoa especially really carries through the entire taste experience from beginning to end. I believe the chili is designed to dovetail nicely with the alcohol heat as you just can't pick it up without the spice. Seriously, there is almost no indication this is an alcoholic beverage (well, until you get through half of it). Most impressive.    F: Medium, and less heavy than you might expect. Very little carbonation to speak of. Very good construction and just immaculate balance in making all this flavor work together.    O: Really amazing stuff.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Bottle. Pours a black of some sorts. Aroma is vanilla, cold brew, soy sauce, and peppers. Also a ton of rich chocolate. I taste Hershey's syrup, vanilla bean, cold brew liquor, soy sauce and some actually pepper flesh. Just a hint of heat. Huge, slick feel. Pretty good but I probably won't buy it again if I run into it.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Dark mahogany color with very little head but a lasting thin tan crown.    There's an almost plum-like quality to the aroma, with coffee and some slight mildly-smokey pepper behind.     The taste is much more coffee-forward. Lightly sweet tasting, with a peppery backend. Medium bodied.    There's a lot going on here. I will say that the pepper addition is well done, adding some character to the beer and a slight numbing burn to the lips, without overpowering anything in the aroma or taste. That said, the balance and flavor of the coffee and other additions didn't really impress me in comparison to all the other delicious stouts available these days. Glad to have tried it, but I won't be looking out for it again.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Reviewed from long-standing notes. Had on-tap at Stein & Vine. Served in a snifter glass.    A: Essentially black and opaque, with no real head to speak of. Minimal if any visible carbonation.    S: Huge on the nose, even when it's cold (as served). Big dark chocolate, bakers chocolate, spicy peppers, coffee. Rich and dank tobacco notes, sweet malts, vanilla, and hints of lactose. Some vegetal sweetness as well. Very, very nice nose.    T: Big chocolate and cacao nibs, spicy peppers, and rich roasted malts. More pipe tobacco. Chocolate covered espresso beans and bits of vanilla. Finishes with both roasted malt and milder hop bitterness after the chocolatey sweetness fades. The spicy pepper presence actually fades a little as it warms through the drink - or perhaps I adjusted to it.    M: Thick sticky body, though not as much of either as Hunahpu. Low carbonation sensation, and the alcohol is incredibly well-hidden here. The beer disappears awfully quickly.    O: This is a very good adjunct stout. The comparisons to Cigar City's Hunahpu are inevitable. I found the Bomb! to have more chocolate presence and less vanilla, as well as not having the thick, glass-staining body. Missing the cinnamon and molasses of Hunahpu. But in its own right, this is a very good beer. And relatively easily obtained in convenient 12 oz. packaging to boot. Not likely to be the best you've ever had, but you owe it to yourself to try it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Roasted malts, coffee, molasses, and hermit bars baking in the oven greet the nose, followed by a touch of smoke and licorice. Taste is a blast of waffles covered in maple syrup, followed by gustatory incarnations of the scent. A warm scintilla of booze and chilli pepper linger on the tongue... alcohol is well hidden for a 13 percenter. Mouth feel is a bit thinner than the flavor might suggest, but leaves nothing to be desired. One of the best stouts I've ever had, barrel-aged or not.

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from the bottle into a chilled mug. Pours very dark with a chrimson tint. Smell is phenomenal, heavy with the smell of dried fruits, chilis, chocolate liqueur, which reminds me of eating the fruit filled See's candies. Sweet chocolate is the first flavor that hits your pallet, followed by a slight red wine booziness, ending with bitter coffee and the slightest smokey heat of chipotle chili peppers that builds with every drink. All in all a very tasty and interesting beer that deserves a go.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Had from the bottle    A - Black, opaque, minimal head.   S - Cinnamon, spice, chilies and some coffee.   T - follows the nose, the flavors come together very nicely. Chilies take a bit of a backseat to the rest of the adjuncts, finishing with a slight warming heat.   M - Medium to full bodied, moderate carb.  O - This is a great beer to be able to find on shelves fairly regularly. Extremely enjoyable but not a true standout in the category.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 On tap, pours dark and opaque with chocolate and ruby highlights at the edges. Smell is vanilla, chocolate, coffee and dark, dried fruits--super complex and outstanding. Taste gets everything in there, with a very subtle warming from the chilies on the finish. Kind of genius, the chilies, and perfectly proportioned. Feel is a rich medium, just right for the style. Alcohol very well hidden. Maybe a little under-carbed.     A great, unique take on an imperial stout. Worth seeking out.
