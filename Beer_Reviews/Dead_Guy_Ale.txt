look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Wow. Just wow. Poured from a bottle to a pint glass, Older bottle on sale at local liquor store.  L- Amber/slightly brown color, thin light tan head that dissipates quickly with nearly no lacing, (possibly due to age of the bottle?)  S- Sweet. Malty and caramelly with a whiff of home brewed sweet tea. Just a touch of hip to the nose but only slightly and under everything else.  T- Follows the nose, tastes very much like a slightly sweet tea, big caramel and malt flavors, just the slightest hint of hop bitters on the finish. A bit of nuttiness comes through subtly.  F- Smooth, slightly....oily maybe? Possibly more like a thin syrup, I can’t quite articulate the feeling. Almost zero carbonation. Whatever it is I love it!  O- Love this beer. Wouldn’t be something I drink all day, but I feel that it would go great after a hearty meal, almost a dessert beer. Absolutely great even with all the sweetness. Cheers!

Look - Pours a cloudy amber with a short white head that quickly dies down to some mild lacing.    Smell - Very mild tones of sourdough bread and not much else. It's a slight but enticing scent.    Taste - Pleasant mildly sweet bready and chocolate notes that I'd expect from a bock.    Feel - Nice medium body with just enough carbonation.    Overall - A decent bock from an American brewery. If I was given this blind, I might have assumed it was a real German beer.

look: 3.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 Pours a dark, amber color with almost no head. Carbonation appears to be low in general.    Smells like sweet, caramel malt. Maybe a little spiciness.    Taste is sweet malts with a slight kiss of hop bitterness on the finish. Actually reminds me of an Oktoberfest. The more I drink, the more the spice note comes through.    Mouthfeel is a bit light and the carbonation seems low which, to me, detracts from the overall enjoyment.    I ended up enjoying it more than I thought I would after I poured it. It kind of grew on me the more I drank it. Good beer.

Pours a nice rich amber color with some mild head and great-looking sheets of lingering lacing. Smells rather faintly of some caramel, spice, hoppiness and a little malt. Taste follows the nose, along with more seasonal spice/clove flavors, caramel, bread and a trace of wood. Smooth, gently rich mouthfeel and good carbonation. A very enjoyable beer and I will definitely try more from this style.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Can't believe it's taken me over 15 years to review one of my gateways. Long overdue.    Dead Guy pours a lovely burnt orange with great clarity and an impressive off white foam that coats the glass from head to toe.    A rediculous amount of caramel and bready malts rise from the surface. Some dark fruits and woody, spicy hops give this almost the impression of a Barleywine. Lighter, obviously.    Flavor follows nicely with an abundance of caramel and orange marmalade slathered on some biscuits. It cuts quickly over into nutmeg like spice, then once again with the herbal, woody, spicy hop finish.    It's a medium, bordering fuller bodied beer, though seems masked by a lively carbonation that lifts the spices giving it a bit of a tingle. Pretty well balanced with an abrupt flip flop from sweet to bittere. There's even a touch of warmth noticed as the sticky, bittered finish draws it to an end.    Still, after all these years, Rogue Dead Guy is a respectable beer. A great fall beer on a drizzly day for sure. One beer that year after year I seem to still reach for on occasion. A little confusing to why they went with an ale format when Maibocks are lagers, but that's nitpicking. Cheers.

This beer smells pretty malty, kind of a syrupy smell. Taste is incredibly smooth, sweet and malty. every time I take a sip I expect a slight bitter bite but never get it, kind of trips me out each sip for some reason. Very easy drinking beer that I like to buy every once in a while and enjoy it each time.

Not sure how representative it is of a lager style considering that it's an ale.     Look wasn't great, basically looks exactly like apple juice with a tiny head an no lacing at all anywhere.    Aroma is a bit like caramel apples honestly. Really, really sweet.    Taste is a lot better, more toasted, bready malts to balance the fruity sweetness. They really nailed it here.    Feel is pretty light for the ABV, easy, good bitterness to balance the sweetness.    Very well done all around. A uniquely-styled ale. Will be picking more up for sure.

A: Pours a slightly hazy, light copper color with a no more than quarter inch, white head which quickly dissipates to a very large bubble (think soda pop) rim and some soapy lacing.  S: Aroma is very limited. Really had to dig for it, but perceived apple, pear, and caramel with maybe (maybe) a black licorice note.  T: Dry. Caramel and pear flavors predominate, but really more watery than malty. Licorice bitterness stronger than supported by the level of malt or flavor. Tingling, bitter aftertaste.  M: Light bodied with low to moderate effervesce.  O: Let me say, this is drinkable, if not by any stretch of the imagination the best representative of the Maibock style. Not malty enough, too bitter, and simply too watery. it were described as a "light" Maibock, perhaps that would make more sense. If it were a soda, one would think it had been watered down. I will try to see if there is a difference when it is decanted from out of a relatively fresh bottle. Really a disappointment.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Slightly cloudy amber body with off-white tan head. The nose offers bread crust, toasted malt, toffee, Germany, bread, and a hint of citric hops (*gasp*). The flavor is firmly sweet, with toasted bread and raw malt being the predominant flavors. I suppose the hops are still around, but they scared. A hint of the floral. The body is medium-weight, a little sticky, a little coarse, but whereas these would be flaws in other beers, in conjunction with the flavors they seem wholly apropos.   Yeah, this is a legit beer. It shows that simplicity can be scrumptious, and my mom and I agree that it's an upgrade from her usual Fat Tires.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Been drinking this beer since 1990 when it was only available in the large bottles (22-oz. I think). Used to buy it at a grocery store in McCloud, CA when I would fish the McCloud River. Was the only place I could get it back then. Iit was always a "special beer" because I lived about 6-hours away from the closest place that had it. Really enjoy the aroma, taste, feel, and finish of this beer. Since I can now get it locally in Washington state, I have some in my fridge right now and am considering home brewing some of this myself.    Not a beer judge by a long shot but this beer hits it on all accounts. The aroma is very inviting and makes you want to taste it. The tasted is full but not heave. Good head with nice lacing as you drink it. Certainly plenty of hops in there but the blossoming of the malts keeps it from being overwhelming. Has what I would call a medium mouthfeel to it. Not as light as a lager and not as heavy as an ouatmeal stout can be. But you know you are drinking it. The finish seems to be both slightly bitter and sweet. What I would call dry without being bitter.     This is one of my favorite beers. I always thought this was expensive until I visited Australia this year. They drink a LOT of beer and a "cheap beer" is $19 for a six pack. Most good beers are $24 to $29/six-pack. So now I treat my self to Dead Guy Ale without batting an eye at the $12.99 per 6-pack price. My other favorite beer was Otter Creek's Copper Ale (a Düsseldorf Altbier) when they used to make that.

Smell: Malty aroma, sweet caramel and     Taste: Smooth and balanced malty goodness. Toasted grain bread, sweet caramel notes, and herbal, earthy bitter hops that nicely counter the sweetness. Slight hint of alcohol as it warms.    Mouthfeel: Medium body, creamy smooth, slightly oily feel, with soft to moderate carbonation.    Overall: Very drinkable malty brew with deftly balances hops.

Off-white head forms a cap that fades only after I start drinking the beer. Nice lacing that looks like a pile of bones.    Nose has an earthy to somewhat coppery nose that reminds me of an ESB, but with a little more malt and less hop florals. With warmth there’s a dry white grape aspect that comes in.    A clean slightly grainy malt opening, one which brings the earthiness of the nose in early. A bit of dry grass, a hint of dark berry, and an ever so slight tang of metal. The beer leans slightly bitter and is quite clean tasting, medium light gel with subdued but noticeable carbonation.

Slight skiff of off white head and cap after settling. Just a couple of spots of lacing.  Rich and inviting malt aroma, and sweeter caramel behind.  Taste of malt and caramel, and well balanced. A little sweet with very little bitterness. Malt and hop combine at the end. Sublime.  Medium mouth feel, low carbonation.  Bright, balanced, hearty, slightly darker ale.

Aroma is bready, biscuit malt & fruity, toast, caramel, honey, slight floral & grass hops. Taste is similar but more robust. Toasted bread, biscuit, butter & candied fruit forward with caramel, honey & a more reserved fruitiness from mid-sip through the finish with hops bitterness manifesting nicely in the finish & aftertaste. There is a metallic/mineral hint in the bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, has a slightly viscous feel, slick & coating on the tongue. A legendary beer & always a good choice.

It's probably been 8 years since I had this one.  12oz bottle, pours a copper color capped with a foamy ivory head. Sweet malty aroma with toffee, honey, grain and earthy hops. Sweet in taste as well with notes of lightly toasted grain, light caramel, Munich malts, honey, and toffee followed by a modest earthy and white peppery hop bite. Full bodied and creamy with soft carbonation, finishing semi-dry and semi-bitter. Overall, good example of an American brewed bock beer even though a bock is a lager and this is an ale; I guess it works..."Rogue Ales".

Not my favorite but easy to drink. Nice for a cool fall day or night.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Can't believe how many times I've had this and never reviewed it. Weathered orange in color with a light haze. Poured with a short off-white foam with medium low retention. Medium malty aromas with notes of bread crust and sweet grain. No esters or hop aromas. On the heavier side of medium bodied with medium light carbonation. Smooth, slightly oily feel through the middle with pleasant boozy warmth near the finish. Medium high sweet and grainy malt flavors followed by medium, spicy hop bitterness through the middle. Toasted bready malt flavors on the back end. Finished cleanly with light grainy malt notes. Hop bitterness nice balances the malty characters of this brew. A style defining beer and an under appreciated style. Tasty, malty, smooth and drinkable.

This smells like a caramel candy of some type, to me. Maybe a little Werther's without the buttery part. Malty, bready, slight citrus undertones. The flavor is sweet, rich caramel malt, baked bread, and definitely a lingering citrus note, but not the bitter rind thing. Thick lacing down the glass, looks great. Slightly below average carbonation, but, sufficient, medium full body, a bit sticky, and fairly dry. Damn, pretty nice brew, here. First time having this.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Rogue's Dead Guy is purty good...    Truly an appealing reddish, rusty color beer. Though there is no head, no lacing, it is still very appealing to the eyes. The smell was boozy - a very nice surprise. Probably the least appealing aspect of this beer was it's mouthfeel, it was light-bodied and supple. I did enjoy the taste with it's light booziness and distinctive ale flavoring. Probably not the best ale I've had but still purty good...   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Seen this beer in various forms of drinking everywhere, decided to try it.  Look: Amber with a medium white head.  Smell: Bread, caramel, a hint of citrus.  Taste: exacly as the smell. The hint of citrus is very subtle.   Overall: this is a solid beer. I thought it would be more hoppier than it is, but its a great beer none the less.

Taste is a refreshing detour from anything hop-forward, as his is about tasty malts, earthy goodness, just a well-balanced tasty brew. Flavorful biscuity malts and a slight peppery zing at the end, and after several sips the fruit notes return...just a hint.   Feels low carbonated and creamy-rich.   Very well-done. Ive seen this beer on shelves plenty of times, even in giant jugs if I recall correctly. Glad I finally tried some. Delicious.

Really good and easy drinking beer.

look: 3.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Clear medium dark amber body with no lacing and minimal head.     Flavors are kinda bland; sweet malts followed by spicy and bitter hops. The effect is not quite nullification but it does soften the malts effect. Carbonation is soft and that's appreciated.     Pretty good.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Reviewed from notes. The appearance has a golden orange-brown color with a small white head that lasts several seconds and then disappears. There is some minimal lacing, slightly spotty and spreads out. The smell has some caramel, malts and definite aromas of fruit with some slight hops in the background. The taste has some sweet caramel notes with light fruit in the background. On the palate, she sits about a medium, comes across fairly sessionable, and has a fairly low carbonation about it. Overall, for those unfamiliar with the style - sometimes it takes a little bit to warm up to this style, but if any American brewer did this style well, my hat has to go to Rogue.

Thin off-white head dissipates steadily leaving no residual head other than a thin ring of foam along the outside of the beer.     Smell is malty forward with some bready notes and a touch of spicy hop. Pretty unremarkable.     Taste is malt forward with some spicy hops. Touch of sweetness to the beer, but just a complimentary amount. Dry finish but its not dry per se. Not sure how old this bottle is, but the hops have held up remarkably well. I'm impressed.     Feel is rather light but not thin, drinkable, touch dry on the finish.     Rogue calls this a maibock inspired ale ... Im not getting much maibock here, so to style, its not a great example. On its own merits, its an easy drinking malt forward ale. I actually enjoyed it more than I expected to given its lack of adherence to the style.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 355ml bottle poured into a mug.    The pour yields mildly hazed orange amber color with thick off-white creamy head that withstands with good retention before gradually subsiding to a decent layer of foamy crown and leaving plenty of lacing ring and patch.    In a nose, creamy, bready, honey, buttery, toasted, nut, and caramel, all from malt mingle with good hop character ranging from spice, floral, earthy, and some exotic fruit.    Spice, fruity, floral, and earthy hop get along well with caramel, toasted, buttery, honey, and sweet bready malt together with a significant cut of bittering hop to balance and add more well-rounded deliciousness to the taste buds.    Medium body with some good crisp and lively carbonation through the palate that generates fine smoothness, finish is dry.    Good Maibock offering from Rogue with its robust malt and extensive hop compartment.

Smells malty sweet and fruity in a mild, mango or unripe peach sort of way.  Feels full, smooth. Medium bodied. A little sticky. Taste is somewhat malty and a little fruity, but there is an earthy, woody flavor that's hard to pinpoint. Like a water chestnut. A hoppy, peppery after taste lingers. Some alcohol presence.

Pours hazy dark orange (all over the damn counter), medium viscosity, with a one finger white head that dissipated before I got a usable picture. Nose is sweet fruity bread, taste follows, with a slight dry/bitter close. OK mouthfeel, overall very good. I've had bottles foam over, but this gushered like a volcano.

Sweet, bready aroma with a hint of underripe plum.     Sweet taste with underripe fruit on the backend, then a dry bready finish.    Relatively thick-bodied with decent carbonation.    This is an old beer bottle. No date, but it doesn't have the new logo. Still tastes really good.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 This is a weird one for me. Definitely honey and caramel. I would put this somewhere between a maibock and a marzen. It's a good beer and worth a try but I don't think I'll go out of my way for it.

look: 4 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.75 With the new Maibock tasting thread scheduled, and all of the inevitable discussion about Dead Guy and the debate over its style niche, I went on the hunt for some DG -- and almost failed to find some, but Rogue's BeerFinder helped out.    I drank this stuff a lot back in the early days of the Micro Boom®, but I've never reviewed it. With my enthusiasm for German-style beers, I could never understand why Rogue called this a Maibock. These days I see they're just calling it an Ale "inspired" by Maibocks, not sure how to rate it, but I'll follow BA's listing.    12 ounce bottle poured into my short Becher glass. No bottle dating to be found. 6.8% ABV now listed on the label.    L -- Clear, deep amber color with a dense and creamy, cream-colored head that holds up well.    S -- Caramel and earthy malt notes up front, warm-fermented fruit esters with warming, spicy, herbal hop notes and peppery alcohol back.    T -- Caramel sweetness with peppery alcohol and herbal, bitter hops. Citrus, peach fruit esters follow the bitterness, but the bitterness dominates the aftertaste.    F -- Mouthfeel is slick and syrupy with a dry, almost astringent finish and medium to light-robust body.    O -- This beer is reminiscent of a Maibock in color only. The strong hoppy bitterness, caramel malt character, and fruit esters are more akin to an American take on a Strong Bitter -- and not a terribly bad one at that, but stand this up to a Hofbräu Maibock (probably the most robust Maibock available) and the contrasts would be glaringly obvious. Re-categorize this as a Strong Bitter -- or better, an American Amber Ale and I'll alter my scores.

S - Vibrant and lively, with a dual assault of malt and a sneaky bit of citrus.     T - Hops, hinted at in the nose, display themselves more fully here. These give way to a brisk pineyness, if there is such a thing.     F - Less active than might be expected from a beer of this color...and also, for Rogue especially, a very dry finish, but not too quickly.

Surprising bitterness follows. More hops than you'd expect from the nose. Notes of pine and pepper. Medium and somewhat sticky in body. Finish is spicy.    O: A classic.... and a great beer for its time. One of the hoppier Maibock's I've had. It's not one I'd want often, but still a good change of pace type brew.

T/F: Very smooth taste, with the malts being upfront, but some light hop bite at the end. Good carbonation and a fairly dry finish.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 Poured from a chilled 12 oz bottle into a pilsner glass.    Looks: Lovely copper color with a good bit of haziness, some aeration and 3 fingers of head.  Aroma: Honey, sugar, some tropical fruit like lichee.  Taste: Malt, some notes of sour mash. No hops or other flavors.  Mouthfeel: Clean, virtually no taste towards the end.  Overall: A really unique beer, looks gorgeous, smells sweet, but tastes...really different. I liked it and would drink it again if I was tasting a bunch of different beers in an evening. I wouldn't go out of my way to order this one.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Pretty bland, the flavor is mostly toasted malt, honey, and a dry hop bitterness. It's an okay beer, but there isn't much to talk about. It's a classic and I'm glad I tried it but this'll be the only one I have.

Popping the top I get a waft of white grapes and sweet tarts. Pours into a nonic pint to a deep amber with a tan two finger head. On the taste this is a balanced ale, not sweet or bitter, nor bittersweet. Mouthfeel is good. Way more simple than I was expecting. Some caramel notes and chaulkiness but overall quite plain. Don't see what the rage is about. I would drink again but pricey for what it is.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Look- 3.75- light copper, amber color. A little haze. Two finger off white foam head, long lasting. Plenty of lacing.  Smell- 4 - big smells, two row malt, tropical hops, apricot. Slight biacut aroma and fruity sweetness.  Taste- 4 - a little malty sweetness (honeyish) that is complimented by spicy/herbal hop taste. Sweet up front and hop spicy/butter in the back. A little fruity and earthy from the hops. Fairly well balanced.  Feel- 3.75 - creamy mouthfeel, almost smooth like porter but a little more carbonation. Medium to medium high body with medium low carbonation. A little booze warmth. Finishes fairly dry.  Overall- 4 - a nice spicy ale in a 22oz bottle. Wouldn't turn one of these down in the winter or fall. I would buy another bomber of this, but maybe not commit to a six pack.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Poured from the can,into a Cigar City pint glass.    Thick,creamy,off white head ,that stands just under 1 finger high.Nice cascade on the pour.Amber in color,with distorted clarity.Light carbonation.    On the nose I get mostly earthy malts,with some caramel,and faint citrus.The aromas are a little nit hard to detect.    The palate follows the nose with sweet,and toasted malts in the lead.Some faint caramel flavors,with just a hint of bitter hops,and citrus.    The body is thin with a slight dry,yet smooth finish.    This is a good beer.Not something I would drink all the time,but something I will definitely drink again in the future.

It's a little different than a typical Helles, a bit high alcohol and a bit more balanced in my view. Really nice orange color, pretty strong flavor but not overpowered by any one taste, though I did notice a bit more licorice/anise flavor than I expected. Still, this was well made and I'd definitely order it again.

Aroma was a musty grain and plant life kind of setting.    Such a malt bomb. A little bit of alcohol sting, I don't get what the love for this beer is all about. Not a fan. Not a lot of flavor, unless you're into the earthy dirt laden tobacco road lager yeast feels. There's plenty of bitterness but it isn't derived from the hops or anything that aren't really here. Unsweetened toffee.     I will cynically proclaim this beer has some good artwork and marketing. This is their flagship right? Yeesh.

Smooth, very easy to drink, not harsh in carbonation, but yet refreshing.    Overall, pretty good, grabbed this on a whim due to the label, and I am pleasantly surprised.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 One and a half fingers of creamy, off-white head. Slightly hazy and amber-colored. Head persistence is ok, and lacing twists about the glass.    Malt smells of dark bread. Tiny amount of alcohol warmth adds a comforting impression, with something spicy and lively rising from the hops. As it warms, aromas of candied fruit and more intense crusty and toasty tones are more evident. Sweet, dynamic and wonderful.     Toasted bread is the first impression on the palate. Hop bitterness on the upswing. Herbal and peppery hops make a nice match for the slightly sweet and heartening malt. Finish is a nice mix of satiating bread and a lingering, piquant bitterness. Aftertaste mostly made up of said bitterness. This may be the only room for improvement in this brew.    Medium body, medium carbonation. All in harmony with the flavors of this Maibock. Slight EtOH warmth and dryness in the finish make for a substantial end to each sip.     Very delicious beer. Warm and inviting on the nose, and then a pleasant smack to the tongue. Deep yet drinkable, comforting yet punchy. Delectable malt and overall peppery impression lead to a fun brew!

Looks- Has beautiful color, like a hiney hued amber.    Smell- A bit of orange, bready, white pepper, promising.     Taste- Orange, orange peel, yeasty, slightly malty, a bit boozy, despite all the tastes not very good.    Feel- medium, wants to be bigger but isn't.     I wanted to like this but, despite the looks and smells another meh beer from yet another overhyped "craft" brewery.

Pours a slightly hazy copper with one fat finger of off-white head that leaves sudsy sheets of lace as it recedes.    Smells of toasted grain, orange rind, apple skin, raisin dusted with brown sugar and earthy, piney hops.    Tastes of crusty brown bread, browning apple, more orange rind and sweetened raisin, and further northwest hoppy goodness.    Feels soft and hearty. Hefty middleweight with creamy carbonation. Finishes dry.    Verdict: Highly recommended. First craft beer I ever bought and it still holds up.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Hazy gold color of a deeper shade, small white cap with little lacing.    Deep, rich malty tones waif out of the glass. Hops are present but in a much diminished form.    Taste is full. This is caramel malt in abundance. Very refreshing change from the herd of IPAs stamping around. Malt enters like a trumpet blast with hops from the string section joining in by mid palate and lasting through the finish. Hops bump up an octave in the finish leaving a lingering high note.    Medium full texture with balancing carbonation.    The Brewer calls it a Maibock and I can't argue. This is an outstanding brew that has stood the test of time.

Taste, however, includes a prominent hop quotient, but retains the malt and a syrupy sweetness like caramel or molasses.     Mouth is full and fine.    Don't know much about helles ale, but I know its bock brothers, and I can see the resemblance. Nice hop and malt balance. The sweetness will put some off, but I don't mind. It's Mictlantecuhtli's favorite ale.

While not mind-blowlingly spectacular, this beer is exactly as advertised: slight maltiness with a spicy (rather than bitter) hop-profile.

Totally changed the way I thought about beer. I still drink it. Sometimes I get an interesting tasting note that reminds me of semi sweet angel food cake. Drinking one right now and it starts out sweet on the nose and mouth (reminds me of many English beers), but then some bitterness comes in.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Popular and interesting for similar reasons.  Hugely popular because it is pleasant; yet it innovates the style.  I understand that Dead Guy -- out of necessity -- emerged because production needed lagering tanks for other brews and this one took too long. So for the next batch, an ale yeast was used. Hence the fruitiness and dryness uncommon to clean lagers. Necessity is the Mother of Invention.    Listed in the "1001 Beers To Taste Before You Die" and reviewed by Randy Mosher, one of Chicago's dean of brewing. He calls it an altbier. And he has a point: it does not have a lager's clean taste. But most agree: it is an experiment that worked very well and has been Rogue's cash cow so it can bring us so many more interesting brews.

It had a nice bouquet of Hops and Apple. Goes down smooth with a nice carbonated finish and aftertaste of bitter apple, hops and yeast. A really nice balance. Too bad the game did not finish the same way. The Caps loss means this beer is not to be drunk again until the Stanley Cup Playoffs are over. Cost = $1.99/bottle, The Bier Cellar, Portland, ME

Needless to say I am not the only one who enjoys this crisp refreshing ale. I highly recommend and challenge anyone to taste it once. Let me know what you think I am sure you will agree with me it is worth every purchase.

Heard this described as a hoppy beer but not in an IPA way. This is one of my first few Maibocks but if they could all taste like this i may be the dead guy. Got two in cellar and hope they get better with time.

Tan foamy head of good retention, moderate lacing. Smells like caramel, toffee, booze, a little tart. Despite being an ale, does indeed taste like a bock. Caramel, dates, acceptable tartness throughout, only light herbal to tea-like bitterness, some alcohol character seeping through. Medium-bodied, tingly, sudsy, not too crisp. This is an Amber Ale, not a Maibock. Could also almost pass for a decent quality English Pale Ale. Honestly, this is like a less alcoholic, less fruity version of their Marionberry Braggot.

Tastes good, but not great. The quality is great, but the beer itself just doesn't impress. Absolutely not worth the 13 dollars for a sixer. I can only hope Rogue's other beers make up for this one.

At the Portland airport they are celebrating a Port of Portland centennial with Dead Guy in specially labeled imperials...just the thing for you collectors.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours a nice cloudy copper color with little to no head. Smells somewhat caramely and bready but my sinuses are messed up thanks to all the blooming trees!! The taste is exceptional with a nice balance of malt and hops, I think it starts on the sweet side and ends slightly bitter, however the sweet taste is more prominent overall. The medium bodied, crisp feel really serves as a nice transition from heavy beers of the winter to the summer ales and light beers that dominate hot weather. IMHO this beer is amazing on draft, one of the best I've ever had. It is still good out of the bottle but not quite the same.

Not much to smell hop-wise, with all aromas coming from malt and even then there is traces of biscuit and carmel. Tastes like a dryer, stronger amber beer. Definite notes of orange. Hop taste is minimal, faint earthy floral hops but that is really reaching. Great mouthfeel, a little more dry than I'd expect but easy to drink; never knew it was 6.5% until I was done with it!    Overall, I really liked this beer and would recommend it to anyone that likes amber beers or bock-style beers.

There's abundant fast moving bubble activity. The beer looks great in the glass.    Slightly sweet malt aromas, caramel, toasted fruit bread, and biscuits.  I look for hops and find malts.    It tastes like above with the addition of malted milk balls sans the chocolate. Is that a floral hop or so that I'm picking up? Yes, some candied fruit, too.    Bold body with a smooth feel. Sweet at first, clean finish. A touch of alcohol.    A pleasant surprise.

It smells of malt, pear, caramel, and some earthy spice. The taste is complex: sweet malt, peat, molasses, coriander, and a hoppy, bitter finish. There's a lot going on here. This ale is medium-bodied, nicely carbonated, and easy to drink at 6.5% ABV. Overall, this is the type of ale I enjoy: well crafted with lots of flavors, substantial but at the same time easy to drink. This ale would pare well with a hearty meal of pork or beef, or for casual drinking with friends. Very good!

This pour was particularly cloudy, which worked well with the weather here in the "Couve"...     Good clean glass - good start    Smells like feet - typical for a chum-swillin ale    Such a great hearty malt taste - almost salty as well as sweet    Wonderfully smooth and even-bodied goin down    Don't think I'll ever get tired of it - prefer it on tap as it is not as consistent in bottles (and almost as expensive!)    I don't know what that's about, if I can get Lagunitas all day long from 650 miles away for $10 a six, why can't I get Dead Guy from 90 miles away for any less than $12?     I'll keep letting people serve it to me I guess :)   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Pours a golden, opaque copper, with a bubbly white head. Little to no lace.

It doesn't feel harsh or difficult to drink. Overall, good standard no-frills craft beer right here.     Served in a 12oz snifter.

But being smooth in this case means not very complex flavor. Just a nice ale with no aftertaste whatsoever. Probably would not order it again since it just was not that memorable. Strange to give it high marks and then say I'm not interested in having it a second time, but the flavor just doesn't do anything for me.

LOOK: Pours with a half finger's worth of off-white foam that refuses to die. Dark gold in color with a slight cloudiness. There is a plethora of medium-sized rising bubbles. Lacing is thick and moderate.  SMELL: Strong biscuity malt aromas entangle with mild caramel aromas and subtle floral and earthy hop aromas.   TASTE: Strong biscuity malt and caramel flavors enter initially and are immediately followed my mild floral hop flavors. Subtle bitter and earthy hop flavors along with hints of alcohol enter lastly as both biscuity malt and caramel flavors push on, but floral hop flavors grow slightly stronger.  FEEL: Full-bodied and subtly carbonated. Goes down smooth and creamy. Finishes crisp.  NOTE: A dang good beer. If you haven't had one, go buy one.

S- Not a very intense aroma but entirely sweet maltiness.     T- Bready maltiness, sweet malt, and a bit of citrus hop flavour coming through. Definitely malt-forward.     MF- Medium-High Carbonation and medium feel. Lots of visible CO2 bubbles clinging to the glass.     O-As my first Maibock and my first Rogue brew, I can confidently say that I enjoyed this beer to the fullest. One of the best lagers I've had the chance to try.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Ah, the famous Dead guy ale coming from Rogue. I believe this was their flagship ale at one time, unsure if it still is, but not a seasonal Maibock but one sure to please the maltheads with a valid sessionability sure to have with food.  Pouring this into a mug, there's a gentle hazy pale burnt orange color with a thin white head that settles atop of and gently dissipates at a nice pace leaving some clingy lace gliding here and there around the glass.  The smell absorbs a sweet bready aspiring maltiness running the gamut upon caramel, toast and toffee aromas. Light citrus flexes nicely in the blend.  The taste sparks up with the sweetness of the bready and biscuity malts slightly allowing the citrus to come back and make their way into a sly aftertaste. Dry on the finish, this beer doesn't let one step away without feeling quite settled as the mouthfeel makes one feel quite satisfied in knowing that there's a nice full feel here yet still has the ability to stand with its respected food.  Would I have this again? Of course I would, what other Maibock/Helles lager in the American market can be found anywhere I go and be a great pairing with its respected food? Write back when you find another. I'll stick with this.

It's very flavorful, just the right amount of hops (not too many like some ipa's), and smooth to the last drop. I will definitely buy this one again.

look: 2.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 4.25 Bottle, no date. DFH Tulip.    Appearance: Pours a straight up hazy amber, with 1/2 finger uneven tan head that quickly dissipates. Virtually no lacing. Below-average retention; retains a ring of froth around the edge, but not really anything on top. Should have a persistent head and be clear; it is neither - in fact there was quite a bit of sediment in the bottom of the bottle which is now haze in the glass.     Smell: Toasty malt; sweet caramel; really smells like an amber ale; noble hoppiness; remarkably like the Bell's Amber I had last night (and love dearly!). Interesting that I am told that Bell's is hopped with Wilamette and Cascade, while this is hopped with Perle and Saaz, and smells almost exactly alike. A testament to the overpowering and complex malt aroma. Another commenter mentioned bananas, and after re-approaching this, I can't help but smell overripe bananas.    Taste: Malty arrival, complex; there is a lot going on in the layers of malt here; finish is not exactly clean; a little slick and caramel malty, with some medicinal hoppiness and very slight citric tang.     Mouthfeel: Fairly high carbonation, but not excessive. Slick; heavier side of midweight. Not a very clean finish, particularly for posing as a Maibock. Really this is a failure as a Maibock. This is suffering from its category.    Overall: I know this is supposed to be a Maibock, but it is utterly apparent from the smell, and from the taste, that this is an amber ale afraid of the pejorative name. Well it is an amber ale, and I love amber ales, and it is good beer (though not as good, if you ask me, as Bell's Amber or Lagunitas Censored). It's a malt bomb worth a yearly revisit. It is absolutely not a Maibock; graded as an Amber Ale, this would be 4+.

A: Caramel, toffee, bananas, bread, very sweet smelling, not getting any citrus notes that others got.    T: Picking up some citrusy hop notes in the tastes, up front it's caramel, hint of bananas, the middle is citrusy hop bitterness, finishes bitter and dry, taste is very different than the aroma, lingering mix of bananas and citrus bitterness.     M: Medium body with an average amount of carbonation, dry finish.    O: Not sure what to think, it's almost like the beer wants to have sweet fruit characteristics but then the citrus hop bitterness appears in the taste, its balanced but I don't like the sweet/citrus bitter combination, not for me.

There is a really nice foamy head to this one, lasts throughout the entire experience. A big, sweet, bready, malt aroma is present. Bready malts come through on the taste as well, great balance between the sweetness and malt. Mouthfeel is a wheat filled malt with some fruity hints mixed in, very good for this variety.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours a light copper/amber with a lovely orange hue. Good creamy lace retains throughout. Fruity aroma, I detect bananas, biscuity malt, caramel. Malt forward taste, bready, sweet, and well balanced by a strong dose of hops that are strongly felt in the finish and slightly bitter and resiny aftertaste. Medium to light bodied, smooth, creamy, and highly drinkable. Strong, crisp and piercing carbonation makes it very refreshing. I liked this one a lot.

The smell is rich, sweet, and complex. The taste is similar. I'm not familiar with the style, but there's a lot going on here. Tastes bright, but with punch. Also feels full and tasty on the mouth from start to finish.

Aroma is malty of caramel, honey, some bread, spicy orange, subtle nuts and red berries. Taste of caramel, molasses, honey, red berries, bread then orange, cranberry and slight apple. A quite dry, caramel then orangey, earthy bitterness in the finish. A very malty, sweetish start and then a fruity, citrusy end. Really decent.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 Not really a huge fan of this one. Its fine, but more money than I want to shell out for something this middle of the road. It has a nice fruitiness, and as a whole it works well in a hot climate such as Thailand, but just is lacking a few elements that could push it over the top and make it a more interesting beer. Rogue has made a huge push in the last few years into bars in Bangkok, so Dead Guy is something I often drink, tho wouldn't if I lived in most other places in the world. Generally, of the beers available here, Leffe or Hoegaarden is better value and both are available draft whereas Rogue is bottle only. I expect that situation will be changing soon as the thaw on SE Asian factory lager monopolies (Singha, Tiger, Chang) is on in this country in a big way, finally.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 This one took me a little while to get into. At first, I did not like it at all. The only reason I even tried it again was because it was the only beer available one night when I got off work. My roommate had the fridge stocked with Dead Guy, so I had a couple with him and it slowly started to grow on me. When I went to the Rogue brewery in Newport (I used to live in Oregon) and had it on tap, I was hooked. Now, it's one of my favorites. The only thing I do not like about it now is how damn expensive it is, especially here in New York (where I have lived for about seven years now).    Overall, I enjoy the dark flavor of Dead Guy and do not find it at all bitter. It is a good balance of flavor similar to a light porter but with the complexity of a stout (when had on tap). Warning: once it begins to get warm, the flavor turns on you and it becomes very unpleasant. I find all Rogue ales are better had cold.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.75 Look: A cloudy, but pretty amber/orange, with a huge and fluffy cream colored head. The only flaw here is the clarity, but for a Maibock, that's an issue.    Smell: A gentle bouquet. An uncharacteristic smell of citrus hops pairs up with caramel malt to create a perfume of mandarin oranges. It's certainly unique. Definitely intriguing. Tells me I'm in for an atypical Maibock.     Taste: Much more to style. The malt is complex and sweet, yet gentle. Buttered biscuits, toast, and a drizzle of caramel. A light bitterness sneaks in. Unfortunately, while it doesn't detract from the beer, neither does it add anything. Some floral hop notes are better at bringing interest.     Mouthfeel: Light and smooth, with little carbonation. A watery quality created more problems than one, as it drowns out the flavor. Here is where the beer falls much too short for my taste.     Overall: With a skeleton logo and a menacing name, it's hard to believe this is going to be an everyday Maibock. And everyday it's not, particularly due to the fruity characteristics. Still, it's bland, even with the notable malt complexity. The watery nature of the mouthfeel makes it even more so. After a while, boredom sets in, as you begin to feel like you're drinking tampered-with tap water.

This is one of the only Rogue beers distributed in Chicago that I know of, so I've had it a few times, but for this review, I'm pouring from a can into a pint glass. Pours a deep orange/amber with minimal off-white head. Smells fruity and hoppy! First sip is fruit punch with a sour bite. Notes of cherry, orange, and crisp hops up front. As the beer warms, an amaretto flavor opens up. Very pleasant. Mouthfeel is creamy and velvety–not too dry or thin. Just right! Overall, Dead Guy is a great anytime beer. The sour bite and amaretto flavor adds excellent character to this almost sessionable beer. Definitely a great introduction to Rogue and the Maibock style.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 Pours a slightly cloudy orange/amber with a big fluffy white head. Smells of citrus and floral hops, a bit of a mineral smell as well. Not much going on really in the nose. Taste is a little better with some sweet malts caramel and bread mixed up with some floral hops and that mineral tartness. Sparkling carbonation, sticky mineral-y mouthfeel, medium body. Nothing objectionable here, but really not up to what I consider the norm for Rogue.
