look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 This was my gateway to Oktoberfest beers back when. This year's tasted good. Looks darker than many Ofests, a deep brown, almost burnt orange color. Nice khaki head faded to lacing. Small is malt. Pretty much just malt. Taste is sweet malts with a slight hop bitterness in the finish, but not as balanced or clean as its German counterparts. Feel is, to me, rich and chewy. Decent carbonation to hold it together though. Overall, still a good beer I'll go back to. Prefer the Germans, but Sam is a good American Oktoberfest beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I really like this beer, refreshing not a hint of bitterness. Smells really good, has a good feel to it and is lightly carbonated. Drank it straight out of the bottle and I could see myself drinking this one a regular basis, to bad it is only a Fall release.

It’s got the Umph of a classic Märzen with just enough sweet, but hop balance to bring in the season or create a memory. It may be my go to if no Ayinger. I’ll revisit that classic, for a double check, but just had it, so I’m surprised.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Poured from a 12oz bottle into glass. Label is notched for a best buy date of February, 2019.  Clear, pale amber colored body. Quick pour brought out a two finger head of off white foam. This settles to thin cap and ring. Leaves behind irregular spots of lacing on the drinking side of the glass.  Subtle aroma of lightly roasted malts. A little toasty.  Rather bold taste of lightly roasted malts, that go to caramel. Some spicy hops. Slightly metallic. A little bitter in the after taste.  Medium mouth feel. Good carbonation.   This beer really emphasizes the malts, which are sweet and bold. The label says "Hearty & Smooth Marzen". I would say more hearty than smooth.

Aroma is toasted and caramel malts with a hint of cereal and dark bread; there is a fruit and floral hint in the background.Taste is toasted caramel malt, thin notes of brown sugar, raisin and roasted nuts followed by a little spicy hop bit and a peppery finish that rolls over into the aftertaste with a little lingering bitterness.

Taste toasted malt over powers a bit and leaves it feeling a little heavy apron finish. Overall, for a beer that’s a dollar or less a bottle it’s good and I buy a case every year when I comes out. For an Oktoberfest it’s heavy and lacking in flavor and finish. It might just be me but I swear Sam Adams was better 3 or 4 years ago....

Clean, crystal clear amber/orange Oktoberfest.  Caramel, a mineral/stony aroma...spicy, earthy hop profile.  Rich malty flavor...caramel, brown sugar, bread. Some chewy flavors here and a subtle hop spice. Very nice.   Medium body, clean finish, carbonation is just right to style...not quite dry but never cloying either. A pleasure to drink.  Real good American Oktoberfest.

But we all have different tastes and this may well suite those who prefer a caramelly taste without it being to heavily sweet.   Enjoyable and smooth!   
look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.75 This is the beer that got me into craft beer a decade ago. A friend of mine came over with a six pack and handed me one. Up until that point I'd only ever drank american adjunct lagers and maybe a few imports. At first I didn't know quite what to make of it, but a few days later I went out and bought my own six pack and the more drank it the more I realized how good it was. A decade later and it's still a favorite. I like almost every beer that calls itself an oktoberfest , but I still haven't found one I enjoy more than this. It's light years ahead of the Boston Lager.    Edit: Had to lower my score a bit after realizing I prefer the German Oktoberfest beers. I still think this one is really good but it's bit too sweet which makes it difficult to enjoy more than one at a time. I also think this beer only tastes good when it warms up. There is a wonderful complexity that becomes apparent when it is a few degrees below room temperature, but when it's cold I don't pick this up. If I had to drink it cold my rating would be far lower.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Fall 2018 Variety Pack  12 Oz Bottle poured into glass  Look - deep rich amber with a large foam head fairly slow to fade and good glass lacing. As part of this category, I will say the Sam Adams bottle logos are not as good looking as they were a decade ago, lost their uniqueness.  Smell - sweet malt, caramel, light aroma of spicy fruit. Smells fresh which i always appreciate.  Taste - Mellow but certainly pick up the caramel malt and biscuits. Lightly roasted malts. Fairly sweet but balanced with a touch of hops. There is a slight orange or cherry flavor that is a nice profile addition. Very drinkable but moderately filling. Not overly carbonated which is nice.  Overall, i think this beer is not a massive flavor punch but very solid easy drinking Fall beer that i do enjoy  I will give this beer an A-

Nice looking, amber body and lasting tan head. After having several of these at various temperatures up to 55F, I concluded that the beer lacks a mouth-filling malty body that I'd expect of a fest beer. Flavor was primarily sugary sweet, with inadequate hop character to balance.     I found this beer hard to drink. I ended up mixing in a few ounces of a bitter pale lager into a bottle of this octoberfest. The result cures the hop deficit and also goes a long way to hide the lack of malt body.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I always enjoy just about any brew from these guys. This is very smooth and malty. It has a very slight hops flavor so this would be more for the malt lovers. I am one, but now like the hoppy ones as well.

Boston beer company does a great job keeping the flavour profile in this beer high!  Pours an inviting, dark amber with a nice head. Smells of malt sweetness and bead. The taste is nice and complex and the finish gathers more malt! Which I always enjoy! Slightly bitter and slight dry at the end as you get ready for the next sip!   Expacant of Sam Adams, those who began here will always come back and know what their going to get; quality!

T/F: Follows the nose. Sweet and malty... caramel and toffee... a little earthy. Medium to light in body... easily drinkable. Mild hopping for balance at the end but certainly not a 'hoppy' beer.    O: A pretty typical Oktoberfest beer. Nothing special... a bit too sweet for my taste, but the price was right (free) and it's the proper time of year.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Pours amber. Nice, light golden head. No sticky lacing. Aroma is a sweet, brown sugary malt. Taste is sweet and grainy - but not much else really happening. I look for more complexity in my Oktoberfests, and this really doesn't have much. Malt forward and very little hops. It's far from bad though. The sweetness becomes a little overbearing towards the end of the first bottle. Feel is medium with medium high carbonation. Fits the style well. Overall, it's nice to have one of these at a time, but there are better Oktoberfests out there.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 Overall, I thought it was just all right. Nothing special overall. I guess I was expecting it to have a touch of pumpkin flavor versus a spicy flavor. To me an Octoberfest beer should be about lager - various types of lagers - or pilsners. This is not SA's best beer, like Rebel IPA; however, it is a good serviceable beer nonetheless. The color is a rustic autumn. The overall flavor is light and spicy. The smell is quaint of malts and spice; and the overall feel was average. I certainly would not turn one down if offered but I think I prefer to buy something a little more flavorful.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Dark/medium copper with some lacing  Smells of cereal grains, somewhat dark malt and some hops  Taste is darker than other feistbeers I've drank, a good flavor profile involving dark malt, light cereal malt, and hops  Overall balanced and drinkable one of the better examples of the style

A: pours a deep Amber with streams of carbonation capped by a two finger thick frothy sandy head that retains supremely well. Lacing, not so much.     S: caramel sweetness with a faint hint of lager yeast; perhaps even a little hint of maraschino cherry or dried plum. Noticeably sweeter on the nose than the other Marzens I've had in recent weeks.     T: sweet and malty arrival, but not as sweet as the smell. Rich and bready, with a slightly sour toastiness and a little noble hop spiciness right on the end. Finishes a little thin though, with some slickness but not much in terms of lingering flavor.    M: really shines here; hefty feel of a Marzen, but retains the clean feeling of a lager. A little residual slickness is a minor detraction, but willing to overlook that. Carbonation is spot on.     O: this is not the best American Oktoberfestbier I've had, but it's up there. Affordable, widely available, and tastes like it was designed for drink with or after Thanksgiving dinner.

One finger foamy, beige head dissipates quickly leaving a constant ring.  the smell is grainy, malty and sweet with a hint of hops that comes off as metallic.  Heavy in body, with moderate carbonation, it does not beg another sip. Heavy, bready malts and an unbearable astringent flavor that finishes and takes over the beer.    I have had this beer many times over the years and it is hit or miss. This is the first time, however, that I can say it is worth picking up again and it will probably affect my fall and winter seasonal pack purchases.

Smells like traditional caramelized marzen malts, but also with a touch of pretzel dough malts. Both balanced by light hop notes.    I taste a slightly sweet version of the smell, as expected with the malts. Quite a clean finish for a richer brew.    Medium mouthfeel with mild carbonation.    I'll go ahead and rate Samuel Adams Octoberfest | Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams)  with a 4.5

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 L: dark amber like most american marzen it is on the darker side  S: malty, with a light roast not much hop   T: Slight sweet upfront Bread like or cracker malty middle with a roasted malt finish.   F: medium to full   O: A good standard for american Marzens with a heavier roast but not as nuanced and balanced as some of the german originals. This was enjoyable for a fall beer have some every year.

The color is somewhat related for an octoberfest beer but I wouldn´t buy a 2nd six pack. Pair this brew with some havarti for an extraordinary marriage that lingers well into next drink and bite.

What it lacks in complexity it makes up with a clean finish and beautiful amber color. It doesn’t conjure up memories of German Oktoberfests I’ve had, but it stands on its own as a decent beer.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 12oz bottle marked best by January. Pours a dark orange color with only a small amount of head. Smells sweet and malty with a hint of grass. Medium feel, a little short on carbonation. Tastes of sweet malt with some floral hops. Crisp. Ok, but a little too sweet and not enough body.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 Really cool dark orange-ish brown in color, light brown head dissipated quickly. Hints of maple, orange and allspice on the nose, fragrance not strong. Taste was okay to good, with flavors of maple, caramel and pomegranate. Slight malty finish. Good beer but doesn't do a lot for me.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Nice amber Oktoberfest look to this beer with a quickly receeding head from tap at Miller's Alehouse. To me this has a nice scent and flavor. It it's of light caramel malt with some toastiness, not bad but nothing exciting. Also needs more carbonation in my opinion.

The beer pours bright dark copper in color with light tan head. The head fades to a ring and skim coating. The aroma is big caramel and toasted malt. Maybe the most fragrant of any Oktoberfest I've tried this year. The taste follows with sweet toasted caramel from front to back. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, adequately carbonated and undry. It's hard to distinguish between the body and any off flavor or defects. Overall, ok. It's not traditional German and it's even too sweet to be traditional American style.

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Pours a clear, medium amber with a one inch fluffy white head that left ample lacing. Smell is mild with sweet malt and caramel notes.

A great showpiece of the sweet taste complex malt character can adopt. However the sweetness gets away a bit. Slightly to sweet, perhaps in need of slight toasty character   O- octoberfests are all about the malt. That's the whole idea. This one has a complex malt flavor that just needs a little more to tame the sweetness. Great beer overall.

Copper is the most notable smell, with also caramel, brown sugar, pumpkin, and other floral hints.    Tastes woody, quite malty with a mixture of caramel, brown sugar, mild bread crusts, and other floral notes, whereas the hops are quite subtle yet balanced to the mixture of sweetness. Feels creamy smooth.    Very great beer. Enjoyed this many times in my early days of college.

Taste is dry with notes of caramel and brown sugar with a little bit of crusty bread. Light to medium body. Soft sweet flavor lingers afterwards. Love the feel, easy to drink, taste and smell are pretty mild so won't wow you but could certainly knock back a few at a tailgate or game. It's about an average example for the style, but I would think pretty perfect for most fall activities.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25 Look - Clear amber in color with lighter copper hues, two fingers of foamy khaki head float on top, minimal lacing.  Aroma - Sweet and woody, faint oak, grainy, floral spice somewhere in the mix.  Taste - Dry up front, slightly bitter wood notes, malts are fairly complex for this style, I get notes of caramel, pretzel, brown sugar and bread crust, sweetness is where it should be. Hops are hidden in the back but do lend some faint zesty/leafy notes. The finish is very much like the initial taste, dry and earthy.  Feel - Light to medium body, carbonation is perfect, creamy but refreshing.    Overall - I love this beer and look forward to it every year. Autumn in a glass.

It just takes to me the August/September nights when being outside enjoying this beer feels right. It won't impress you but it won't disappoint.

As with most Sam Adams brews, this one is a session beer, not challenging to the palate, that goes great with the season. With fairly understated flavor at the outset, it's got an excellent finish and an aftertaste like a baked good that will put you in the autumn spirit. It's best on tap, but for some reason I prefer it out of the can as opposed to out of the bottle. There are surely better Oktoberfests out there for the more refined taste, but I'll always be sure to grab some of these when the leaves start changing. A New England staple.

Slight toasty smell with an emphasis on the malt     Taste - unfortunately weaker than expected. The malt flavor is not very present and the hops are present, but don't really add much to the presence. As the beer warms, the hop flavours pick up, but it still winds up a plain-ish offering.    Feel - good mouthfeel. An appropriate thickness and fullness for the colour. Slight effervescence on the tongue     Overall - slightly disappointing. Was expecting a lot more flavour and aroma. That being said, it's an easy drinker for someone not looking for an overly fancy beer.

Pours crystal clear deep orange/light copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big honey, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/toffee, herbal, grass, light pepper, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big honey, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/toffee, herbal, grass, light pepper, and toasted earthiness. Light herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of honey, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/toffee, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/grainy, and lightly slick/silky/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.3%. Overall this is an excellent Oktoberfest! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, clean, and easy to drink. Very rich and robust on malt flavors, without being too sweet. A very enjoyable offering.

Taste is barley, hay, fairly bland with an off putting aftertaste. Feel is mostly flat, little creamy to balance.   **   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 One finger off white head, dissipated fairly quickly. Little lacing left behind. Orange/copper color, Crystal clear. Tasted is a nice toasty lager, a little bit of a bitter bite at the end. Bready, toast, a little sweet malt. Light body, medium carbonation. A little thinner than I'd like for the style. Overall, a petty good mass produced oktoberfest lager, but there are better out there.

O: Like I said there is some odd flavor I can't quite place. Also just too sweet for my taste. For what it's worth though, I am reviewing this poured from a bottle.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Second-to-last bottle from my six-pack. Best-by date is March of 2017, so should still be pretty fresh.    Color is a burnt-orange sort of thing, one of the darker Oktoberfest beers I've had. Very clear, with a ton of little rising bubbles throughout and a very nice layer of cream-colored foam on top. Really nice-looking beer!    Smell is pleasant, though not standing out as much as the appearance. There's a definite sweetness in the background, a toasty bread/doughy sort of thing coming in ahead of that, and occasionally a little hint of hop spiciness (this is far from a hoppy beer of course, but they are present.)    Most prominent flavors on the first sip are toasty bread and that doughy sort of thing. The sweetness from the smell is not as noticeable in the flavor, though still there in the background. Same goes for that slight hop spiciness, it's juuust barely there.    Mouthfeel is pretty nice overall, though I do have some minor complaints. Very drinkable, seems maybe a tad thin at some times (mostly after the foam has started to shrink away.) Despite the massive amount of rising bubbles in this beer it never seems overly prickly, just has a nice soft bubbliness to it.    Overall, not my favorite Oktoberfest (last year's Sierra Nevada still holds that title so far) but a surprisingly good one considering all the hate it seems to get -- I was honestly really impressed when I had my first bottle from this six-pack, especially after reading so many posts describing it as overly sweet (I didn't find it to be *that* sweet at all.) I have had it before, but it was a month or so past its best-by date and was not as good as the fresher version (though still not bad -- I guess this is a malty enough beer to begin with that it holds up better to age compared to a lot of others), so I figured I should revisit it -- glad I did!

However, it's only seasonal.

Taste: Well balanced, slight hop bitterness on the swallow.    Feel: Medium with light carbonation.    Overall: I find the taste to be quite enjoyable but I'm not detecting much of the toasty flavors described in the style.

Not a bad thing with this beer though, Light bitterness at first, mellowing out to a smooth drinkable finish at the end. Love a beer with a smooth finish. In my opinion this is a very good tasting commercial beer.     Feel: Decent medium mouthfeel.    Overall: Good cheap drinkable choice for autumn. This is a beer you can bring to enjoy with friends and still be able to please everyone. 6.5/10.

An enjoyable brew overall if you like a more malty less hoppy bear. My personal preference is an IPA but I don't mind this beer at all. Nice for a change.

The flavor is fairly sweet with little of zingy hops from the aroma, graham cracker, and lots of caramel. The mouthfeel is somewhat full, rich, and foamy. Overall this is a middle of the road octoberfest, overly sweet and caramelly, but still drinkable.

There's a touch of malt, though. Taste is better, but seems like a pretty generic malt bill with only a dash of hop bitterness to balance it out. Full feel in the mouth. I feel like I've enjoyed this beer more in the past, but I was not impressed with this bottle serving into a shaker pint.

Such a deep nutty malt flavor....as you drag it past your teeth to create a full and creamy flavor spectrum on your tongue. It is my favorite Marzen - well done guys.

The head recedes to a thin ring, leaving no lacing.  S- The nose is caramel from the malt with a bit of spice from the hops.  T- Taste is similar to the nose only slightly stronger in both aspects  F- Mouthfeel overall is on the lighter side of medium. Carbonation is moderate, but does not impede drinking in quantity as is desirable for the style.  O- A middle of the road sweetish marzen style Oktoberfest. I purchase a few every year and never regret it. Not the best domestic, but a perfectly acceptable substitute when those are unavailable.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Don't underestimate this "commercial beer". Bottle poured into pub glass. This beer must be consumed at slightly cooler than room temperature to really appreciate the big malt complexity it has to offer. At fridge temperature, the flavor and body get drowned out.   Color is a beautiful autumn amber. Big malt flavors of sweet honey, toasted caramel, copper (yes the metal). Smooth finish.   Full body, high carbonation.

Bronze like shit that’s really old but well taken care of because people keep coming back to what works. Tour guide on the label. Sweetness gets my teeth nervous, but maybe that’s just my pH. Putting it in a sauce of cabbage, roast chicken, ginger and garlic, with some sort of fancy white american cheese, and a piece of roll bread, a chicken and cabbage cheese steak. Heavy, for the fest goer who only wants to have one and not necessarily need to shit but still feel like shitting if it becomes an accommodating option. This one sort of battles it out, long and hard, with blunt instruments and high pitched shrieks, resulting in a drunk like a Ren Fest professional, mostly balanced but teetering under so much fermentation a rugby player might puke. I hope the dog that licks up that puke appreciates this fine brew, which even in that state surely tastes pretty good.    https://www.unicornbrewing.com

This very nice Oktoberfest pours a nice  orangish amber with a nice head of off white foam that subsides to a thick ring,  nice pool, and light lacing. Nose of breaded malts, caramel, and subtle hops---  all the usual suspects. Flavors follow the nose but they are darn nice with breaded malts   and bread crust with caramel malts and mild zesty hops that mirror the German   counterparts. Nice mouth feel, quenching, moderate to light carbonation and a   sweet malt finish with a touch of zesty hops. Nothing to hate here, in fact it is as   good if not better (this year at least) as many others I have tried.    Cheers

Moderate carbonation, medium body and fairly refreshing.

Smells quite sweet, with caramel/toffee and like an almost rum soaked fruitcake. Quite sweet flavor, malty, bready, a little earthy underneath all of that. Medium body, a little sticky, dryer towards the finish. Good level of carbonation. Actually sticky and dry at the same time. This is a decent beer, it's a little sweet for my taste, so a "have one" and move on to something else.

T: Acetaldehyde is detectable upfront. Very bland and watery. Sweet throughout with flavors of caramel and apples. Off putting, grassy taste of wet hay and hose water on the finish.    F: Watery. Thin and under carbonated. Quite saccharine and sickly sweet, definitely not my cup of tea.    O: Way too sweet and watery for my palate with nothing really to balance it out.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 This marzen pours a brownish orange color with a somewhat thin white foamy head. The smell is mild, but it is a nice balance of roasted grains and caramel malt scents and some spicy hops. The taste is similar, roasted grains, caramel, spicy, slightly ascerbic hops that come together to make a nice balanced beer. The finish is semi-dry. The body is somewhere between light and medium, and it’s actually lighter than I would have guessed. This is kind of a classic fall Sam Adam’s beer. It’s a really nice drinkable, balanced beer. Nothing too complex, but my only real criticism would be that I would like the body to be a little heavier.

look: 4.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a can on 8-26-16. Wonderful caramel color with a thick foamy tan head.    Bready smell with some sweet malts. Other than that the nose is pretty light without a lot of character.    Taste is roasted malts with a hint of caramel sweet. The taste is like the nose and by that I mean there does not seem to be a lot of complexity here. That being said the taste is of a good beer and I do like the simple roasty flavor.    Mouth feel is slightly thick and chewy, I would call it a nice medium mouth feel.    Overall I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. It did seem a bit strange to be sipping on this beer while it was 100 degrees outside. However this beer did make me long for our cooler fall days coming up. Also of note is the beautiful color that this beer pours out. I would love to just savor this beers cool look for all of my beers. Seriously it is that pretty!

Although you've had some good times this summer, it's a bit of a let down to see it end. One of the good things about this time of year helping to lift your spirits is the availability of the Oktoberfest beers. A lot of people have them, and they're all good.    I had been drinking light beer and shandies all summer whilst gardening and grilling in the hot sun, but I got a call from Precious. She was at Costco and wanted to know if I wanted some Samuel Adams Octoberfest. I said, "Hell, Yeah!" So I've got a 28 pack cooling. This stuff even tastes great warm.    It pours out a medium copper color very clear with a little more head than I expected. It has a great taste and great feel. Note that I hadn't had an IPA or anything stronger than 4% since March. This is great beer, and I'll be enjoying this for the next month or so. Hey, let me go check the fridge. They might be cold by now.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 L: Dark copper gold/Ruby color with a very small head and no lacing.    S: Caramel, with a nice toasted malt. Very slight floral hop but not much. Pretty sweet.    T: Toasted malt, a nice breadiness, lots of sweet caramel. A little sweet for a Oktoberfest.    F: Crisp and easy drinking a clean lager    O: An Oktoberfest that is a little too sweet.   
look: 2 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 I don't see an actual bottle date but FEB is notched in the side of the label.    Appearance: Somehow this poured without any head at all. I can see a ton of bubbles popping on the surface of the beer but what happened to the head? The body of the beer is actually quite dark for an Oktoberfestbier. It has a deep brown and orange color with hints of dark burnished gold. Good clarity. Obviously no retention or lacing on a beer that never even had a head.    Aroma: There is a nice sweet smelling caramel aroma that is light. A touch of buttered toffee. No hop aroma.    Taste: The overall flavor profile of this beer is very light but there are a few good flavors within the wispy plane of near non-existence. There is a light bread flavor with a touch of caramel and a touch of nuttiness with a light fruity finish.    Mouthfeel: Good carbonation and very drinkable.    Overall: This beer is average at best and I really wouldn't recommend it when there are much better beers in this style being produced domestically (to the U.S.) and imported. I am especially disappointed as I thought Boston Beer Company would have produced a much better lager. If you ended up with this beer at some point there is no doubt you would be able to finish it but it will leave you sadly unfulfilled. The word "fest" is in the name for a reason and this beer is too mediocre to be festive.

Aroma: mild, delicious, lightly-toasted sweet maltiness.     Taste: clean water, bread crust, lightly-toasted barley malt, and a mild & generic hop bite at the end of the sip. The flavor is mild overall.     Mouthfeel: light and mildly carbonated; it finishes semi-dry, crisp, refreshing, and pleasing.     This is an above-average beer, yet it's not worth the price per twelve-pack or six-pack, in my opinion. I find it to be just a tad bit too mild. What's there is highly pleasant, but I would enjoy it more if it were slightly more bold in both aroma and flavor.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Probably my favorite Sam Adams beer. It's got just the right amount of everything for a moderately priced, everyday kind of beer. Excellent look and feel for an autumn beer, though not as heavy as some others in the genre.    The flavor has hints of pumpkin and oak, with a nice finish that sits longer on the palate than you think it should. Distinctly subtle in its charms, so those of you who can't taste anything that doesn't shrivel your gums might not enjoy it as much.\    Overall this is a nice little beer that is just right for an autumn afternoon watching football or putting up halloween decorations.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Orange-brown body; wispy head. Roasted grain scent; some musty esters.

Hand this on-tap at Leon Gessi pizzeria while waiting for a couple of pies to go. A decent oktoberfest overall but with nothing really setting it apart from others. The head was really weak yet flavor-wise it made the grade.

Very malty, pumpkin-like quality in the middle, sweet caramel coming in towards the end, capping off the taste.    Feels mediumish bodied.    As per their norm, Sam Adams delivers a crowd-pleaser. Not cheap, or low-end, but not artisan-level either. Enough taste to keep a beer nerd interested, but not enough to overwhelm the uninitiated.

If this thing had some body and some decent yeast, October might suddenly be worth celebrating.

Not malty enough, a little too bitter, too much carbonation t o have the requisite smoothness for a Maerzen. And there is a faint roasted-grain taste which has absolutely no place in Oktoberfest. No funky off flavors so well brewed...just not German-tasting at all.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Appearance is of deep golden amber with bountiful white cap and good lacing.    Aroma is malt foremost, caramel, toffee malt in the sweet sense without hop sharpness.    Flavor is full on malt with depth and richness. This is full flavored and it's good flavor. I get little hop presence on entry, mid palate, or in the finish which is clean and short. Hops are there but too shy to give more than a glimpse of their presence. There is a residual darker malt sweetness (molasses?) in the aftertaste that doesn't linger very long.    Texture is medium to full depending on your perspective.    Overall this is a very flavorful beer packed with malt sensations that range from light through rich to dark with an underlying sweetness that isn't really there, just the sense of it due to the lack of hop sharpness to moderate the full on malt flavor. All malt flavor, like all hop flavor, can leave a brew with a feeling of one noteness though this one does bring some complexity to the table. Not of sustaining interest to the beer enthusiast perhaps but a good one for general consumers.

I cannot be sure why they are not equals. Clearly, GL's relies more on hops for a drier finish. But, SA's O-fest clearly demonstrates why this is such a favorite lager style of those who prefer balance.     While SA's rendition Looks slightly above average, it clearly offers those caramel-malty Smells; yet its judicious use of hops prevent it from becoming sweet as many in this style fall to. Designed to drink in big glasses, the O-fest from SA hits the spot.

M: medium carb. Pretty smooth    O: I used to look forward to this beer every fall. My palate has changed a lot it seems so I don't seem to enjoy this style as much as I used to. Even still, this is a solid example of the style, and will probably continue to revisit year after year.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 A: Poured from the bottle a very deep copper or rust color. There was a finger sized head that was off white. The beer was very clear and left good some lacing.     S: Very bready on the first whiff. There is strong notes of toast and a hint of dark sweetness; it gives one the sense of autumn, which is appropriate. Underneath all of this there is a strange spice scent adding complexity.     T: Despite the heavy bread scent the bread flavor is not as prevalent as one would expect. Malt is strong throughout. The spice notes are more noticeable in the taste. Throughout there is a slight toast and sweetness flavor.     M: Not to carbonated with a medium body. Smooth all the way down leaving some sweetness on the palate.    O: Drinkable, approachable, and unoffensive. By balancing the bread, sweetness, and malt and also including the hop spice it should keep most everyone happy, if not super satisfied. On the whole its enjoyable.

Today with the craft beer movement, American beers are far and away the best in the world.

Pleasant sweetness coupled with good sharpness. Slick smooth full body with prickly carbonation. A little oily and syrupy. Light finish that lingers a little, ending with a faint grassy and roasted malty feel with soft fruity sharpness. Overall excellent quality craft. Delicious and super fresh. Balanced flavors with a nice intensity. Filling yet tender, pleasing and easy to drink.

Looks really nice.    nose is typical lager like with grassy qualities, heavy malts.     Taste follows. Not very impressed. Adjuncts, not much nuttiness. Bitterness is a little off. It does have some flavor though, just doesn't really have anything that stands out.    medium body, right for the style, but aftertaste is a bit unpleasant lingering adjunct lager like taste.    this is an ok beer. Sierra Nevada's Oktoberfest is much better. this one didn't have much roasty qualities and whatever hops were used kind of just added bitterness without much any other taste.

Tastes of mid-dark malts, mild treacle, a little smokiness. Sweet, becoming cloying over time.    Medium body with low level of hops. Some chewiness. Mild bitter finish.    Nothing special. Bit too sweet for me.

Delicious it will not be the best Marzen,oktoberfest style beer you will ever try but it is a worthy effort from the popular brewery.

Like another reviewer, I drink a lot of beer and this was probably one of the first Octoberfests I drank many, many years ago.   I love the octoberfest/marzen style and this is a good marzen -- one that is readily available if out at a bar in the Fall. I don't bag on Sam Adams, as they've done so much for the craft beer industry and still make decent, drinkable (albeit large volume) beer.

look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 I know Fall is around the corner when this starts to pop up in my grocery store. Brings a good sense of nostalgia since this Sam Adams launched me into the world of beer outside the Macros. This was the beer that started it all for me.    That said, this starts to hit the shelves in late-August, which is still the depths of summer in Florida. Before we even get a tiny bit of relief from the heat, November brings their Winter Lager.    It's a good beer, but more of an emotional review for me. It's not the best Octoberfest I've had, but this is a good and cheaper method of introducing yourself to the Marzen style. It's an old-faithful that I know will be there every year. And every year I will always get a six-pack and move on.

Although I am sure the German Marzens are better tasting at the source. This did not have the tinny taste that I've become accustomed to when purchasing German-made beers off the shelf in Canada.

Look: Reddish amber color, appearing golden through light. Arrived with small amounts of thin white lacing.    Smell: Roasted malt and grain.    Feel: Very smooth, with some carbonation.    Taste: Malty and very minor bitterness, but balanced by sweet caramel hints, along with trace amounts of fruitiness on the back end. The aftertaste is very nice, reminding me of a fresh salted pretzel.     Overall: This was the first Octoberfest style beer I have tried, and honestly knew nothing about it. I typically prefer darker beers, but was interested in trying something out of my realm. I'm glad that I did, because I really enjoyed it.

Appearance - Clear and rich dark orange colored with some reddish hues in certain lights. Nice looking dense and creamy two gingers of off-white head, robust head retention and lots of lively bubbles particularly near the top of the beer.    Smell - Plenty of grain, specifically some corn, aromas of autumn. Some slightly vegetative aromas, but nothing offputting.    Taste - Clean, lots of grain with some caramel sweet notes, bitterness is subdued. Traces of a spice flavor. Again tastes like fall.    Mouthfeel - Smooth, clean, moderate body and modest carbonation.    Overall - Decent Oktoberfest beer, far from the best butr far from the worth. Easy to drink and no off-flavors. Worth a shot if you're looking to but a couple away.

look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 Poor - From a 12oz bottle - Nice poor; semi aggressive poor produced a 3 finger head. Slowly settles down to a nice top layer of lace. faint light lacing.     Appearance - deep amber/dark pumpkin brown. Clear and very little carbonation.    Nose - Roasted malt.     Mouthfeel - Medium fizzy, airy, almost Belgium like. Not an easy drinker. Gassy.     Taste - Light malt, lemon. Not much else.     Finish - Not much of a finish.     Final thoughts - Not to my liking. Not really anything here. I'm not a malt centric fan. There isn't much hop here at all and mostly light malt.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Good beer that feels light and sweet, malty and can go with lots of food including pizza.     Mouthfeel is light and malty, sugary and some hint of roasted malts. Not very strong and not very malty but a good octoberfest beer.    Overall good beer but there are better choices if you want maltiness and taste to come out.

It's a straight up, full flavored, malt forward lager that seems to defy it's mere 5.3% ABV.

A - foamy ivory head caps a copper colord body  S - caramel, toffee, brown sugar, toasty grain, spicy and earthy hops  T - sweet and malty with tons of caramel and toffee flavor along with toasted grain, spicy yeast, and earthy noble hops  M - fuller body, moderate carbonation, finishes with nice balance  O - one of the better American brewed Oktoberfestbiers in my opinion. After a couple, it does get to be too rich and too sweet, but it's still pretty good.

Half finger head that dissapates quickly.     S - Bready malts.     T - The ol standby O'fest. Bready, malty, a touch of vanilla sweetness.     M - Mouthfeel is light, a touch watery, Carbonation is medium.     O - A good straight forward octoberfest.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Can you find a better Märzen? Absolutely. But can you find one as good or better at this price point, available in pretty much any store that sells beer in the US? Absolutely not. A great seasonal go-to beer that won't empty your wallet.    Look is a brilliant, crystal-clear orange/copper hue that lights up nicely in the right lighting. Moderate carbonation leaves a decent little head that leaves a bit of lacing after it dissipates.    Smell is of warm, roasty malts. Maybe a little hop spice.    Tastes how it smells. A nice malty taste with a bit of spicy noble hop finish. Maybe a fruit (pear?) note. Pleasing malty/bready aftertaste. Mouthfeel is prickly from the carbonation.    Overall, as previously mentioned, this is a fall cornerstone for me. Unless your palate will only accept overly hopped beers, this is a great, well-rounded and enjoyable lager. Makes a really good addition to beer bread, too.   
look: 3 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3 pours an amber color with probably an inch head. SMells of malt and spices. Tastes of the malt comes on strong and the hints of some spice sort of comes thru. I honestly expected more from this brew.

look: 3.25 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 On tap. Pours amber with a one finger head that leaves no lacing and recedes quickly. Aroma of toasted malt and subtle, grassy spice. Taste follows the smell- toasted malt and bready body with a barely noticeable sweetness before a grassy finish. Medium-light body and light carbonation with no aftertaste. It lingered and was a little sticky.  I expected more from this. I kept waiting for the Oktoberfest characteristics to come out, but they never really did. The caramel was super subtle and required some searching. I also didn't pick up any semblance of hops at all. It was one dimensional and boring.

Light sweet notes.  T: Mildly malty.  M: Light bodied. Low carbonation.  O: Not impressive. Still prefer the trademark Boston lager.

Aroma of sweet, roasted caramel malts and mealy flesh fruits (apple, pear)and tastes just the same. Pretty spot on, and pretty thick mouthfeel. Refreshing.

An amazing looking beer overall.    S - A very sweet, malty aroma overwhelms the nose. Predominantly roasted malts. Not too much else present here but very pleasant to the nose.    T - The taste lives up to the scent about spot on. A fairly sweet beer with dominant flavorings of roasted malts. Notes of caramel are present, especially on the back-end/ aftertaste it leaves.    M - Medium to full bodied beer, quite rich feeling. A decent blend of carbonation though slightly harsh for me. Very crisp beer.     O - First Oktoberfest style beer I've had before; wasn't sure what to expect buy enjoyed it very much. Would definitely like to try few other renditions of the style. The beer itself has a beautiful appearance and great tastes and scents, although I feel there is something missing. Will definitely have again.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Pours from the bottle into a stein a clear orange-amber-ish colour, topped by two fingers of tight head that recedes to some rings but does leave a bit of lacing. Not a tremendous amount of visible carbonation.    Smell is toasted malt, a bit of caramel, bready, a bit of biscuit. Faint hints of maple (or maybe I just want to smell maple because of the season), light milk chocolate, and noble hop aroma--light grassy, hay. Nice.    Taste is light, refreshing. Aspires to creaminess, but there's a bit of astringency. Still, this is malt forward, sweet, toasty, biscuity. Slight lagery yeastiness, tanginess. Again, a bit of a crisp grassiness or hay flavour. Body is surprisingly light, and the carbonation moderate.    Seems fairly on-point for the style, but can't compete with some of the true German renditions. Still, it's nice, refreshing, pretty clean. Very drinkable. Not a favourite, but not mad that I've got five more to drink the fridge, either.
