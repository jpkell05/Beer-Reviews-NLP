look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 Straight pour from a 1 pt 1.25 oz/510 ml pry-off bottle to a teku. This has a bottling date of December 26, 2018 printed in white ink below the “Bottled On” square at the bottom left of the label (“BOTTLED ON: 122018), which would make this beer about three and a half weeks old at the time of consumption.     Appearance (4.75): Three fingers of fluffy, pillowy foam rise off of the pour, capping a crystal-clear, deep golden-colored body with orange undertones. The head dies away at a very leisurely pace, leaving dramatic meringue sides dissipating to spooky, Spanish moss-looking arms and legs that tie the broken initial collar to a frothy cap. Classic, gorgeous West Coast IPA in appearance.     Smell (4.25): A surprisingly slick, juicy, sweet orange aroma wafts out of the glass at first, chased quickly by grassy, herbal notes that hint at bits of resinous ganja lost in a hayfield when you were out having a picnic. Dry common crackers, pain de campagne insides, and stale biscuit crusts make a very subtle appearance, quietly adding some dry depth for that grassy, herbal, kind of Noble-inflected hop profile.     Taste (4.5): Classically West Coast, this motha flocka is stridently bitter with big notes of yellow grapefruit skin, fresh-cut Timothy grass, and dried flower petals bounding out of the gates. The malt body is, you guessed it, “restrained.” It’s there, but its dryness and floury, not quite starchy presence only serves to emphasize the Alpha bite—which, conversely, makes the following up-and-down of citrusy, grassy flavors pop just a bit more than they would otherwise. (And that’s why West Coast (D)IPAs will always have a place in the American beer canon.) In the finish, the beer manages to dip a toe into “soapy” without giving you an off-putting shock of astringent suds. Like, it doesn’t feel like a mistake, and actually feels natural as the various flavors from the mid-palate mingle with those hop-dominated flavors on the back end, dissipating into a crispness that demands a moment of contemplation. No sign of booze.     Mouthfeel (4.75): For being this dry and bitter, this beer is shockingly smooth—at least in the body. Medium-weight and slick, the body washes in on a thin, but kind of cushy bed of foam that prickles in its own right, just before it washes out. That carbonation is fine-grained at first, medium-grained next, and washes out with a soft, moderately full foam. It’s nice. It definitely drinks like its weight, but still feels almost sessionable. Quenchable AF.     Overall (4.25): Okay, so to be honest I didn’t know what to expect with Blind Pig. Yes, it’s one of the class American West Coast IPAs, but I was unfamiliar with what to expect in its flavor profile. I just assumed yellow grapefruit and pine, and while that’s not wholly wrong, there’s more happening here than I was expecting, in some way. Like, for example, the almost Noble impression that the hops gave me. Also, it’s crazy drinkable and, not surprisingly, a looker. Make no mistake though, this is old school West Coast all the way—and for that reason, probably not for everyone. But if that’s what you’re looking for, then you will not be disappointed. Definitely recommended.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 O - I think I would be hard-pressed to find a comparable IPA these days. The shelves are lined by Hazies and it's hard to find a fantastic reference to the classic IPA of a decade ago. (Don't get me wrong, I'm a NE IPA fan - but I miss the classic, which has become a rarity.)   --  L - Fantastic clarity. A happy yellow.  S - Lovely base with echos of pine plus citrus notes popping on the backend  T - Cohesive. Complete. Deep bitterness that I tend to miss in the days of Hazy IPAs. IPA without the fuss.  F - Good body, but not distracting. Reminds you that you're drinking a real beer and that you should take your time to savor it.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I received this from @bum4ever in the NBS BIF 8.5 Secret Santa. Bottled on 11/30/2018 and poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a crystal-clear bright gold with more than two fingers of fluffy, snow white head and thick lacing. The tiny bubbles ascending the glass testify to its effervescence. The nose features lemon and grapefruit, along with heavy pine needles and floral hops. When sipped, the first thing I notice is how dry and bitter it is. Only as the glass warmed did I taste any malt and even then it was deep in the bitter, resinous background. The citrus is dry and bitter but it opened up with some subtle sweetness as the glass warmed. The rather complex hop bill adds intense bitterness. It's hard to believe it's only 62 IBU. This ale is crisp and lite with lively carbonation, and at 6.1% ABV you can easily down a second pour. Overall, this is a quintessential West Coast IPA that is superbly crafted, delicious, and fun to drink.

F: Carbonation/bitterness profile is very good. A little lingering bitterness.  O: The 1st time I've had BP. Aroma's were a little weak, but recovered nicely as the beer warmed. Flavors were very well balanced, esp late.

A: Pours a slightly hazy, orange-amber color with a one quarter inch, white head, but little retention or lacing.  S: Almost floral aromas of tangerine and peach evident over a caramel malt spine.  T: Dry. Palate deviates from the nose, as significant peppery bitterness is the focus. Like PtE, a clean, crisp finish.  M: Light to medium bodied with medium carbonation.  O: Solid and drinkable.

Nose is deep citrus, dark pine, some thin floral notes, and a grapefuity tropical notes. Taste follows the nose woth mostly orange peel and extremely balanced grapefuit pithiness along with a mellow dark piney note. The malt backbone is clearly evident with just enough sweetness to balance out the hops but keep them expressive. Really smooth and silky mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Finishes clean and semi dry with citrus and grapefuit/pine/spruce stickiness.

This is a fairly light and crisp IPA, not the most interesting I’ve ever had, but clean and well done. The nose is not overpowering but consists of nice fresh hops with citrus, tropical herbal notes. Pineapple, mango, and other tropicals along with grapefruit peel and pine come through on the taste. I found it unexpectedly better. Others may not think it is so bitter; for me, 100 ibu doesn’t taste so bitter when balanced against heavy malt. In a lighter beer with a lower malt bill, even 50 ibu can seem like a lot. Such is the case here. It certainly grew on me by the end of the pint and I could see the relationship to Pliny the elder. I will look for it again!

Pours an orange gold, two finger head of creamy foam, heavy lace clinging to the glass.    Like Pliny, this IPA is very balanced. Hop presence, citrus, and floral qualities all see better than the pig as they climb through your nostrils. Very balanced.    A milder beer than Pliny, but still packs a nice bitterness at 6%. Not as much citrus as on the nose, but you get so much nice floral, malty notes to compliment the bold hops.    Crisp and clean. Very drinkable, and a solid flagship IPA from RR.

Smells of clementine, orange peel, lemon, grapefruit, biscuit, caramel, toasted grains, sweet malt, fresh cut grass and herbs. Hoppy notes come through but don't dominate, it's very well balanced.    Tastes like it smells with grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, tangerine, zesty citrus hops, piney hops, toasted grains, caramel, brown sugar, biscuit, light toffee, piney hops, faint floral hops and flowers and then some light peppery spices such as coriander and white pepper. Not the hop bomb I expected, it was a bit of a letdown.

Beneath lie a crystal clear pale yellow beer.    Nose pops magnificently with lemon and hints of the caramel malt.     An aggressive bitterness coats the tongue even before any tasting occurs, but once the taste opens up I'm getting that massive lemon. Beyond the lemon is just the faintest hint of dandelion that morphs into a more piney thing. That maltiness in the nose takes a backseat to all the hop goodness, but still offers a slightly sweet background note.     Finishes mighty dry without too much aftertaste or after "bitter". Very clean beer from start to finish, medium bodied and pretty quenching.    I was challenged by the sender to offer an opinion on this v. Pliny, and as much as I thoroughly admired the latter, this one may very well get the edge. It's fantastic to say the least!

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Bottle dated 2/21:  Pours with a clear, leaning towards copper body. Huge volume of white head on an aggressive pour I softened once I saw what was happening. Lacing is in splotches.    Nose has a hint of grain with a citrus rind and grass nose. Some sniffs have a little bit of a classic ESB nose. Warmth and more scrutiny has me noticing a little sweet grapefruit with rind.    Taste starts with a husky malt, giving a little (non-sugary) sticky feel similar to what I get with oat. A little orange zest and earthy dried pine needles come together by mid-taste. Feel is nicely soft, though it could probably use a little more carbonation (hope my pour didn't extract it all). The grassy notes from the nose I never see in the flavor (maybe it comes across as those dried pine needles). The ending is citrusy and earthy, in nice balance. A fairly clean ending, just an ever so light dry evergreen bitterness.    Let this one warm more after finding that Pliny at the same age kept improving with warmth. The more floral than fruit citrus notes became more evident but didn't evolve. A nice IPA that had some similarities to Pliny, but is a little simpler and a more earthy.

Perfect interpretation of what's become known as the west coast IPA. Golden orange pour that's neither crystal clear nor hazy. Clean. Lively body speaks to the perfect carbonation. Soft white head that eventually sags and lingers. Aroma of pine, melon, orange zest and grapefruit. Nothing pakalolo-like or overly fruity. Taste is pine, orange, grapefruit, melon with an anchoring bitterness that seals the deal. Drinks ridiculously clean and crisp throughout. Would keep this in the fridge at all times if I could.

L: 3F head, which sets off some hop fade alarms for me. Good retention, sticky lacing, prolonged cap and ring. Beer is a very clear light amber with carbonation bubbles.     S: Fortunately there's still a good amount of citrus and floral notes in the nose, with hints of pine and dankness and some malt.    T: I want to be careful because I've never tasted a fresh bottle or on-tap, but I think it may have faded a bit. It's still got some lemon peel, grapefruit, and pine in it. Malts a little more forward than I would like, but not too much.     F: Light to medium body, medium carbonation. Good drying. Balance and construction well above average.    O: I totally get why RR doesn't want their bottles shipped. This is well above average as is, but should I get a chance to try one on-tap or within 10 days of bottling, I'll be happy to revisit for a look at a superior rating.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Had it on tap at Monk's Café in Philadelphia PA. What a treat to have Russian River on the East Coast! As a bonus, I also got to drink Pliny the Elder for comparison.  Like Pliny, it pours a clear amber orange color with a modest foam cap that retains well.   In the nose I detected mostly biscuit and toasted malts at first. Later, I began to pick up some of the grassy and piny hops aromas as well as a hint of citrus.  The taste and feel are where it is truly at for me regarding this brew. Compared to Pliny the Elder, there is less juiciness in the taste. Instead, there is a drier palate and a predominantly hop forward flavor that is piny, citrusy, yet, clean and not overwhelmingly bitter or bombastic. The dry finish is refreshing. There is an ever so slight malt backbone, however, the simplicity of this one and its emphasis on a moderate hops forward taste is beautiful. The feel and drinkability is sublime. Medium to light bodied, crisp and ultra refreshing. I give it a perfect 5 for feel.  This is basically like a simpler and more sessionable version of PTE. I could truly drink 10 of these! I wish I could get it more often. West Coast IPA at its finest!

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from 510mL bottle into a tulip. Bottled 10/21/16.    Appearance: medium golden hue with a moderate haze and a finger of frothy tan foam atop. I like it.    Smell: earthy, grassy, herbal hops. There's a little bit of sweetness underneath as well; I like it but the overall effect is pretty low-key -- it doesn't really pop.    Taste: the hops are a bit richer here than in the aroma, and the bitterness is quite high. Earthy, herbal flavors combine with the light sweetness to create a nicely satisfying quaff.    Mouthfeel: medium body with a good carbonation and creaminess for an IPA.    Overall: I like Blind Pig quite well; I feel like the aroma could use a little more oomph but other than that it's a tasty and nicely drinkable beer.

Bottle date was a tad over 2 weeks prior to drinking it.    I sometimes like to start with "Overall" because it's a nice intro to the review... O: easy to quaff, and easy to forget the ABV.    L: Though I live in the Northeast, I'm still partial to clear beer. They don't need to be crystal clear, but I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the thick cloudy stuff they're serving around here. Blind Pig is really clear. It's a straw color, and effervescent.    S: quality. I don't know how else to describe it without using cliches. There's a hint of piney resin, fruity hops, but it just smells balanced and refined.     T: Smooth as silk. Jeez, I haven't had a beer like this in a long time. I need to get back to my Harpoon IPA roots, as this reminded me of that. The flavor comes from a balanced use of early, mid, and late addition hops. No hop blasting with this. There is a crisp malt flavor too, but it's not cloying.    F: thin compared to what I'm used to these days, but a nod of approval because to me this is what a beer should be like. If I want a glass of nectar, I'll buy some nectar. This is great.     O: easy to quaff, and easy to forget the ABV.

Smells of citrusy, piney hops, much like Pliny the Elder. Dank, resinous undertones as well. Smells really like fresh hops. I got a bunch of them today at Nor Cal Brewing in Redding and it reminds me of them.    Oh, the dank strength of this brew, and freshness of the hops! Citra amongst a tonne of other west coast hops, all resinous and bitter, balanced to perfection with a nice malt backbone! Oh, and I can drink so much more knowing its not a double IPA! Heavenly.    Creamy, smooth, slightly resinous but very clean, with creamy, slightly foamy carbonation. Smooth as Guinness.    Bottled Sept 13th, drank Sept 19th, one of the freshest beers I've ever had. Got it at Russian River Brewing Company in Santa Rosa, drinking in Davis, near Sacramento. Drinking it from a Pliny the Elder glass at Motel 6.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 | overall: 4 Russian River Blind Pig IPA pours a clear golden orange color. The head is a half inch of white foam that folds into a quarter inch of lacing that sticks around. The aroma has a very well balanced hop profile. The piney, citrusy, and floral components all marry well together. There is dank grapefruit, pine resin, pitch, flower pot, blood orange, and more dank grapefruit. This is a remarkably complex aroma. The taste is much drier than the aroma leads on. I think it looses a lot of complexity, because of that. There are some nice citrusy notes of tangerine and blood orange, and a little pine. The nice floral notes present in the aroma don't translate into the flavor. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with a thin texture, and appropriate carbonation. Overall, I really love this beer's aroma, but only like the beer as a whole. As a lover of dry IPAs I never thought I would one day find one that was too dry for my tastes, but here we have one. Its lack of body is a real detractor for me.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A - nice golden Amber colored clear beer with a. Nice white head that leaves God lacing  S - big pine, grapefruit, white grapes, oak, citrus zest  T- big pine, oak up front, grapefruit, white grapes, citrus zest, wood  M - light to medium, alcohol covered, aftertaste is pine, oak, grapefruit peel  O - good beer, not better than Pliny although many may say so. More of a top of the line go to daily drinker.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Has the usual yellow and light amber appearance, yellow winning the battle and producing a 3/4" white head that is impressive with a good amount of clarity. Aroma drops pine and green. Plenty of aromatic Simcoes, usually a bittering hop right?     Taste brings some non grapefruit citrus and mild tropical notes. Very light cracker toasted toast pale malt. Dry mouthfeel. Light body. Still bursting with hop flavors in the mouthfeel. Carbonation right where it should be. Bitterness held in check, definitely not just a bittering hop recipe. The 500ml format is definitely better than bomber, but a guy can dream about finding this in 6 packs someday. For less than $30. . .   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Golden amber in color, foamy, white head with streaky lacing. Mostly clear. The aroma is light citrus and caramel malt. The flavor is citrus, grass, some herbal notes, and malt. This is a well balanced, medium bodied beer with a bit of pine and grapefruit in the aftertaste. Resinous, but smooth. An excellent beer!

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Bottled 8/3. Consumed 8/15.    A: Pours an almost crystal clear pale yellow-gold with a half-finger of off-white head. Sits in the glass a rich amber-orange, pretty transparent.    S: Dank, earthy, herbal hops. Bits of lemon zest and cat piss. Smells archetypically west coast, but aroma doesn't quite 'pop' as much as I wish it did.    T: Very floral with bits of citrus. Flavors of grapefruit, lemon zest, and orange peel. Dank earth and resin come in on the finish and linger on the tongue. Very light crackery malt comes out more as it warms.    M: This may sound contradictory, but it has this weird mouthfeel that is both too thin but also surprisingly creamy. Together, these qualities actually make it incredibly drinkable.. Barely a hint of alcohol and malt backbone. Medium+ bitterness on the finish, but certainly not as overwhelming as what I'd come to expect from the style.    O: My first 'west coast' IPA in a minute after spending the past few months indulging (heavily) in the hazy NE-style juice bombs. Blind Pig is a wonderful change of pace and an nice 'bridge' between the two styles. While it definitely leans heavily toward the west coast style in taste, it is surprisingly smooth while possessing bits of citrus to complement the floral bitterness that dominates both aroma and taste. For the style--which I would not compare to that of many of the most hyped IPAs of today--it is a fine brew, supremely drinkable and refreshing.

T- smooth, you get some orange, pine, floral, a slight bitterness on the back of the throat that is completely desired with this great taste going on with this beer.     F- dry finish, lingers over the tongue for about 15 seconds and leaves very smooth.    Overall-  Great flavors and at 6.2 % it is a desire able beer to go for that won't get you in too much trouble. Definitely an A grade beer. I really don't find anything wrong with this beer. It is perfectly balanced and has every taste I desire in an ipa..    Note-   I would compare this to the boneyard rpm by taste.

Spotty lacing.     Smells distinctively malty. Reminds me of a Lagunitas base a bit. Also some citrus and resiny pine.     There is a very assertive bitterness, and even though it slowly works your taste buds over, it is a very smooth/clean/non harsh bitter. It dances nicely with the sweet grains that are so flavorful they almost take on a lager quality. Great balance. Plenty of very resinous, oily pine and just a bit of lemon rind, grapefruit, and herbal hop flavor.     Body is soft and delicate. Kind of slick. Lower level carbonation.     Overall this is an excellent ipa. A bit one dimensional flavor wise would be the biggest knock, but it also does it really well. The thing that stands out the most is the smoothness and balance of flavors. Just like Pliny. It is a very well made beer.

Smell is split evenly between malt, lemon zest, and herbs (cilantro and tarragon). It's sweet more than anything, but it's not overbearing.    Although pine resin is definitely there, woody and earthy flavors are mostly in the background. The dominant flavor is white grapefruit, and bitterness stands above any other sensation, but again, it's not overbearing. Grape leaves – and is that cactus jelly? – are in there, too. There is some more dark fruit that I can't quite place... currant?    Feel is pretty smooth, though not quite at the level of Pliny    Another good offering from Russian River (ah, those expectations).

A: Golden color, clear, with an ample white dense white head with solid retention. Ample lacing left in the glass.    T: Citrusy, slightly piney/resiny hop flavor, with ample clean malt support, lightly sweet, with a moderately light hop bitterness. The beer is super crisp and has a dry finish.    M: Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation.     O: Super tasty; the beer has a great hop profile in the aroma and flavor. The hop additions, coupled with the beer’s crispness and clean malt character make this a super easy beer to drink!

Some underlying pine notes with a nice amount of malt sweetness. A bit of a caramel notes also.    Taste is fantastic... I actually like it better than Pliny. It's more crisp and less sweet. The hops are the star, and the crispness and moderate level of carbonation only elevate the taste more. A very creamy mouthfeel. More grapefruit, citrus, and pine. Good stuff.    Overall, this is a great IPA! I see it pairing well with beer cheese bites. It gets a 93/100.

The balance of malt and hops isn't as good as Pliny and mouthfeel is a little lighter than Pliny as well. This is a very good beer but if I had my druthers I would always take the Pliny first.

Smells like pine and grapefruit, and tastes the same. Feel is medium. Overall, this is just a killer IPA. I had it alongside Pliny, and thought this would be a dialed-down version of the Elder. However, it was kind of the opposite: where Pliny seemed muted and restrained, this one was bursting with hop flavor. Terrific stuff!

A bit resinous and sticky. This one grew on me. About halfway through the pint, its smoothness became apparent.     My favorite IPAs tend to be a bit heavier on the tropical fruity notes (e.g. Tired Hands Alien Church), but for a classic West Coast IPA, this is very good.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A - A huge very thick head that holds well for over a minute. Clear light amber color with only minimal bubbles.    S - Light pine, citrus, and some pear. Hints of tropical fruits.    T - Some bitterness that holds for 15 seconds. Alcohol is barely detectable. Flavors are not very strong.

Its a very good IPA and I always get one when I'm at the brewery but, after having one next to other notable IPAs Im gonna have to say theres other beers i would get before this. Theres nothing wrong with the blind pig big, its a got a great orange/light look to it. Looks like a lot of other IPA's out there. I think I would have given this beer a better score if it didn't have deep bitter taste as the other IPAs i was having that day. (Bells two hearted) I still love this beer and would know doubt get it if i saw it on tap

M= Moderate carbonation, medium body.     O= Old school IPA flavors, more bitterness than flavor or aroma. Doesn't reach the peaks of their PtE. This is good, clean flavored, and does not have flaws. Just not much to right home about.

It's got that great west coast bitterness, loaded with hop aroma and taste, tropical fruit essence, and a dank mouthfeel.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 On tap at Monk's in Philly. Pint glass arrives with a half finger of foam. Clear orange color. Aroma is awesome with grapefruit, orange, pineapple dominating.     Flavor is an explosion of hoppy goodness. Tons of citrus hops and there is just enough malty sweetness to barely balance things. Bitterness is moderate and very smooth. I'd describe more but hard to review on phone. Suffice to say, hype is deserved.

Definite honey to like ready french toast sweetness on the nose. Citrus is also present so like an orange zest french toast. A nice herbal bitterness also present.     Taste dry sweet biscuity malt with a balanced citrus peel bitterness.     So easy to drink I wish this was more readily available.

But, this is just a great beer, regardless of how long the recipe has been around.

Smell: Super citrusy; tons of grapefruit, mango, pineapple. I smelled a bit of the malts in the background also.    Taste: Wow! I think this is just as good as Pliny! Kind of like Pliny's younger brother. The hops used in this are super citrusy but there is hardly any bitterness! An amazing feat for such a flavorful IPA.     Feel: Has a very smooth mouthfeel for an IPA, drinks very well.     Overall: This beer is incredible! Russian River never disappoints. Wish this beer was on tap more often but it's an amazing treat. I highly recommend this one!

Pine and citrus peel on the nose, flavors are somewhat dank and a good bit of caramel malt. The alpha acids came through in the finished beer in a big way. For a 6%ish IPA you will get your money's worth of IBUs here. West coast IPA fans will be in love.

look: 3 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3 Allegedly, this is the little brother of PtE, yet it falls short. It's not bad by any stretch, yet it's not on the level of many IPAs that are more readily accessible. I'm not a fan of clear beers that leave minimal lacing, so my score reflects it. Hints, and I mean hints, of citrus in the nose are overwhelmed by grass and distant pine. The taste offers faint orange peel and forest sap. Some lingering soapiness on the back end. Seriously, this just isn't as balanced as I would prefer, nor is there an overwhelming aspect of it that raises it above any of its flaws. Not a bad beer by any stretch, but not something I would grab were it readily available.

A – Pours a clear golden orange color with 2 fingers of head and lots of lacing as it settles.  S – Aroma is citrus and a bit floral but not very strong.  T – Some grapefruit zest on the front end, a little piney with some bitterness on the finish.  M – Medium mouth feel and carbonation.  O – A very well done West Coast IPA.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Had on tap at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia.    Pours a mostly clear copper color with about half a finger of creamy white head. Nothing special in this regard but it's pleasing enough.    The nose is quite pleasant; nothing in particularly sticks out but the gestalt is very effective and valanced. There are discernible elements of pine, tropical fruits, and citrus rind. Quintessentially west-coast for sure.    The taste is where the beer begins to truly shine. This might be the most balanced IPA I've ever tasted. Everything present in the nose makes an appearance. The beer is simultaneously tropical and piney but these bright flavors are balanced and softened by the perfect amount of hop bitterness and just enough malt so that the hop flavors aren't overwhelming. The mouthfeel is well-carbonated and about medium in thickness for an IPA. Finishes bone-dry.    Overall I was very impressed with Blind Pig. The beer itself is as much an exercise in showing hop strengths as it is in showing craft and restraint. Very possibly my favorite single-IPA of all time at the moment…would love to get the chance to try it again.

It was perfectly balanced with notes of pine and orange peel citrus. It poured a copperish with white head and wonderful lace. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall....YUMMY!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Finally was able to get a bottle in a trade. Got a Bling Pig and a Pliny so got to try them side by side. Bottles were two weeks old.    Pours a nice clear orange with a nice nose. Decent head, and a more typical west coast hop forward beer. I found it very refreshing and a solid single IPA that I would buy again and again. Its clearly Pliny's little brother and its supposed to be. Looking forward to finding another.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Bottled 10/1. Drank 23 days later, and I'm hoping it hadn't fallen off too hard already. I only say that because it seems to be missing just that zing I'm expecting on the back end. Strong hoppy nose and taste combines with mild bitterness, slight juicy feel. I guess I'm being unfair and not meeting this one on its own terms, because I had a Pliny last night and that just seems to have the "total package" Blind Pig lacks for some reason. I don't know – maybe it's that Pliny has a higher ABV.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Serving Type: Bottle (dated 10.1.15)  Consumed: 10.4.15    A: 4.5 Pours a clear, copper-gold with a one inch, off-white head. Good retention and lots of lace.    S: 4.75 Plenty of hops on the nose with waves of pine and onion up front. Grapefruit, honey, and lemon show up as the pine settles down. The hop character fits beautifully in with subtle, earthy malt aromas.    T: 4.25 Taste is similar to the nose, but a bit less complex and balanced. Starts with a bit of sweetness and honey flavors, followed by fairly bitter, piney hops, then finally lingering malt and more, grassy bitterness.    M: 4.5 The body is really nice and substantial while remaining crisp and refreshing; this is probably in part due to the excellent carbonation level.    O 4.5 Excellent beer. Not quite as balanced as Pliny, but the amazing aroma and drinkability almost make up for it.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Received two bottles in a West Coast to East Coast trade.     A: Golden coloring, slightly orange. Off white head with great lacing.

The finish is somewhat dry.  O: This is a fantastic beer which is overlooked sometimes due to the hype that Pliny the Elder receives. I would definitely recommend a fresh Bling Pig to anyone, cheers!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Total classic, and I kinda love that the taste is "classic IPA" in nature -- piney bitterness in this one. Very floral. Some caramel sweetness as well that pokes through, but the story here is that piney bitterness that sits on the back of your tongue well through the last gulp. Nose is nice, pine, caramel, some faint citrus and a light herbal/earthy character.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A very approachable IPA for amount of hop it carries, with lots of depth of flavour and a very dry finish.  S- Its sweet on the nose, with hints of rye bread and apricot.   T- Subtle and complex this beer goes through the full typical ipa fruit spectrum but carries nice cardamon, cumin and butterscotch as well. The hop is in the middle allowing time for a sweetness fresh finish that prevents any of the cloying build up that many hop-heavy ipa's have.  F: Very dry, light but not thin.

look: 3.75 | smell: 1.75 | taste: 1.5 | feel: 2.25 | overall: 2 510 ml bottled on 082615. Exactly two weeks old.    L: Clear golden in color. Small head quickly settled before I even get a chance to instagram it :) very nice lancing. Beautiful appearance for sure.     S: Big fail. This one is not aromatic. If there's no date on the bottle I would assume this is pretty old. Very light citrus, light caramel and hint of pine.     T: bland, reminds me of an old english-style ipa. I can't believe the hype of this beer. There's a light spicy/herbal flavors that I can't describe but noting really unique.     M: unpleasantly dry aftertaste, very bitter, and very light. Extremely drinkable but not sticky or juicy. Very good carbonation however, I really enjoyed that part.     O: Maybe the most underwhelming drinking experience. Extremely overhyped beer. This is nothing close to a good ipa, definitely below average ipa.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 On tap:  Pale yellow, lightly hazed beer. I like the light pale color, the white addition seems a tad odd.??head makes up for the color, though: nice, white, and foamy at the edges. Lacing comes in spotted sheets.    The nose is surprisingly . Warmth brings out some grassy notes. I also get a little lemon rind.   The taste, however (and mildly paradoxically) is quite enjoyable. Mildly hoppy opening that seems clean of malt. The initial taste I get reminds me of noble hops. More hops pile on that add a more distinctively grassy flavor. Despite the draw on the tongue this brings, it somehow seems refreshing with hints of citrus-including the lemon rind from the nose.    Finally the somewhat unexpected spice bite hits. It's sort of like I picked a stalk of grass from a field and stuck it in my mouth like I did when I was a kid to emulate what I assumed farmers did.    Solid IPA.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 One of my favorite IPA's.     Look- Pours a beautiful slightly hazy pale orange with small streams of carbonation.     Smell- Citrusy, hoppy, and a tad sweet, not as aromatic as other IPA's though.    Taste- Wonderfully citrusy and hoppy, ever so slightly sweet that balances out the bitter perfectly. Very very tasty.    Feel- Quite light and easy to drink for the style. Many IPA's I have had are almost a meal in themselves, but not this one. Very refreshing and drinkable.    Overall- As I said earlier, it's my favorite IPA. Very easy to drink, perfectly balanced, and very tasty. I definitely recommend and I will definitely buy again.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3 Bottle 8/10 poured into a sniffer on 9/4    Look: Appears a golden-orange color. Lots of very large soapy bubbles with small bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass   Smell: Aroma is honey and malt with some citrus elements. It also has a “dirty” water smell to it which I haven’t experienced before with a beer.   Taste: Taste is malt flavor followed pine and sap notes. Bitterness rolls during the middle and leaves the mouth dry. Maybe it is the age of the bottle but the taste disappointing giving the “prestige” around this beer   Feel: Crisp. The malt gives it a nice feel in the middle of the mouth  Overall it definitely has the balance I expect from RR but this was way too muted in flavor for my taste. Maybe I need to drink it fresher but given this experience I wouldn’t purchase it again if given other choices.

Other than that, I love this beer and will walk miles, once a week, to savor a pint or two at a very fortunate bar.

Very nicely pours with a puffy khaki colored head. Though it doesn't stick around long, the head settles and leaves some nice lacing behind it and is quite consistent.    S — Smells of lots of fresh hops and is quite bitter, lots of piney, citrusy aromas, lots of character.    T — Nice layers of flavors, quite bright, lots of piney character, some bright bitter citrus, and is overall bitter and resinous without being overly sweet or sticky and cloying.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 Love this beer. As much as Pliny especially after they tweaked the hops in Pliny. Aroma is floral and crisp and fresh. Taste is also crisp with notes of berry and citrus. Not unpleasantly bitter at the end. Beautiful golden color and creamy head.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 7/26...on tap at Monk's. Bright copper, low foam, but full lid. Spicy pine nose. Citrus too. Powerful balanced hop cuts through a malty base, grapefruit, pine abounds. Bitter stays with you. Delicious.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured into my tulip glass, I might actually like this IPA better than Pliny (The Elder). I know: that sounds ridiculous given the rankings. Pliny is more of a hop bomb, though, and this saps your tongue and tastebuds of their capacity to taste the more nuanced flavors of this amazing brew. Blind Pig, on the other hand, is hop-forward but is not overpowering in bitterness or pine. There is an amazing balance in this brew between green pine, caramel nuttiness, and fresh tropical fruit. Of the citrus, grapefruit and lemon are most notable (in smell and taste). As opposed to Pliny TE, I could drink this all day long… and at 6.1% above, I just might.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 If you like IPA this is a great tasting beer for you. Balanced hop and citrus flavors that goes down smoothly. Smell has a hint of grapefruit and floral hops.  Great beer especially fresh from the tap!

Anyway, this didn't strike me as anything special though. Maybe just because the market is flooded with mega hoppy IPA's. Anyway, its still incredibly smooth, rich and creamy. Definitely worth trying~

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 This IPA is average at best. It's good, not great. I don't understand the hype and people falling over themselves to get it. I'm sure it's because of the lack of accessibility outside of California or simply because it's a Russian River brew. Either way, I'd pass on this any day over Pliny. There are far more better IPAs out there that the average Joe can pick up at their local beer store or super market. So in summary, don't believe the hype on this one.

T: Hop forward beer progressing through light fruit, light malt, light biscuit, long lingering citrus rind bitterness moderated and balanced by a light malt and fruit sweetness but overall it dries out in the finish. Hop flavors are above average, hop bitterness is moderates.   F: Creamy, medium body, medium carbonation.   O: A big IPA with complex layers of flavor and a delight to drink.

Extremely tasty IPA that is underrated because of its shadow to Pliny.

Sweet breakfast roll and citrus on the nose, bit faint until it warms, when some sweeter citrus and deeper malt notes come out to play    Gloriously hoppy flavor, balanced slightly to the bitter side, bitter orange peel and a hint of pine, light malt and honey sweetness.    Mouthfeel is spot on for a big IPA, full body with a good lash of carbonation    Overall, I've really been looking forward to this one... one of the white whales in my favorite style, and happy to say it doesn't disappoint. Not too big, not too little, just a very nice take on the west coast IPA style, but not super-aggressively-bitter. Were I closer to the brewery, this gem would be in my fridge whenever possible.

Head dissipates quickly leaving a little lacing and a quarter inch foam.     Smell is of pine, mango, and some sweetness like honey. Some floral notes mixed in as well. I was expecting a bit more aroma.    Taste starts with some malt with in your face hops. Pine, floral, and a little juicy. Bitter dry finish.    Good carbonation and crisp profile. Everything it's cracked up to be. Can't wait to taste big brother pte tomorrow.

Prefer it to the PtE I had last night, but that was was getting little long in the tooth. Would love to do a side by side of fresh BP and fresh PtE

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Poured into IPA speiglau. Golden Amber color. SRM ~13. One and a half fingers width of white head. Constant trail of bubbles. Smell was incredible: pine needles, juniper, and grapefruit citrus. Taste was clean and refreshing: crisp beginning with a building of piney bitterness. Punch of grapefruit and hints of orange. Great resurgence of creamy foam upon agitation. Moutfeel was crisp and clean, ultimately refreshing without being too light. Overall, a heavy hitting IPA that stands formidably against most conventional DIPA. Great beer from a great brewery!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Clear golden-orange color with slightly off-white head. Aroma has the classic west coast hop profile with sweet oranges and also a solid malt backbone. Taste starts with sweet oranges but goes into bitter grapefruit pith territory and lingers on the aftertaste. Medium to light bodied with medium carbonation. A really classic but very well made IPA.
