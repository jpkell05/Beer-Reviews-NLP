look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 It’s PBR. A beer that predates the American Civil war. When men were men and women were too. It’s not some pansy frilly beer to tickle your hipster stash. It’s a mans beer, for those loggers, mechanics, welders, farmers. You know.... people we call Men. Sadly, women have more testosterone than the boys bashing this beer. But not everyone can enjoy a mans beer.    Some people need to learn how to write reviews. It’s not an IPA it’s not a top of the line import. It’s nothing more than an old school American beer. If you think anything more or less of this, stop writing reviews please.     I’ll keep it simple. If you are on here, you probably don’t drink Milwaukee’s best or natural light. Chances are you may not like this. It’s better than most beers in its price range, typically lower than coors light.     A lot of people compare this to Schlitz which is a malt. A lot of people relate this beer to your redneck back woods beer. It has a revival in cities like NY and Philadelphia among the newer generations who tend to steer toward the IPAs. Some social circles have even rebranded PBR as the new hipster beer.     Regardless of what you hear, it’s worth a shot. It has a harsh taste at first but it is smooth compared to other beers people on this site compare it to.

Always my go-to brew over the years. Never disappoints.  Good value, nice inexpensive date.  Won the blue ribbon at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago... also known as the Chicago World's Fair, over AB Michelob, although I prefer AB Michelob a bit more today if they were to hold the contest again. Still, PBR is one fine AAB brew, although I am concerned about GMOs mentioned in a few articles, but I believe Pabst got the message.

The beer pours bright golden straw yellow in color with nearly white head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is faint with a little grain and a barely tart tinge. The taste is grainy, barely tart, corny with a malt liquor sweet edge. Almost no bitterness in the non-dry buttery finish. The mouthfeel is thin bodied and highly carbonated. Overall, not good. Too sweet and way too much oily/soapy/buttery aftertaste.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 2.25 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.75 PBR, my go-to fridge stocker. Great for a hot day while outside and mowing the lawn, or working in the garage. Overall I think it has more flavor compared to other american adjuncts. Also at a price you can't beat, $18 for a case of 30 here in Texas.   
look: 3 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.75 Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip.     L: Clear light golden pour with 2 fingers of fluffy white head. Modest ring of lacing.    S: Light grains and adjuncts... corn and light hops.    T/F: Light... grains and more adjuncts. Some sweetness with modest bitterness. Not much hop flavor... relatively crisp/clean. It's primary flavor is probably 'cold' but at least it's not overtly unpleasant. Thin bodied.    O: A generic adjunct lager. Amazingly this is the 1st time I've tried this old standby. To me... it's primary virtue is not tasting overtly bad. Maybe fine on a really hot day... at a ballgame... or maybe with a meal. It tastes like being in college on a budget.

look: 3.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Look: obviously a american adjunct lager with the nice pale yellow look like most pilsners or weiss Bavarian ales    Smell: smells like can and corn but not as bad as other cheap beer got some malt in there    Taste: ok we all know this beer its cheep and affordable but out of all those american beers its the most drinkable besides rolling rock but only if its in a glass bottle but pabst has some taste its a little corny but there is some malt flavor poured out of a cane inti a glass this is a bomb ass beer for cheap. Tastes like blue can fosters with a hint of MGD    Feel: light mouth feel easy drinking    Overall: look ive have cheap to top shelf craft as far as beer in general its my favor alchohol so when i say for the style in price i mean it the only other cheaper american beer thats better is yuengling but its a different style and ill say this is better than its pilsner but only when poor in a glass not straight from the can. All and all not the best pilsner ive had that goes to lagunitas pils but for a american marco brew the best.

Flavor follows with cereal grain being main focus. A touch of honey and earthiness on the end.    Very light, highly carbonated, balanced favoring sweet. Dry finish.    The quintessential punk rock bar beer. I've had too many to count and never plan to stop. After all, it was selected as America's Best in1893. "Ahhh, that beer taste!"    Cheers.

I'm no snob tho, what a welcome experience to gulp a half glass and enjoy the refreshing light thirst quenching taste. It also has an iconic can and pours a beautiful glass of beer. $90 for a half barrel. Nice.

Look: light and bubbly, white gold.    Smell: yeasty, burnt white bread, fermented rice.    Taste: grainy, no corn, bitter, dry finish.    Feel: lots of carbonation, actually a good mouth feel.

The presentation of this beer is top notch classic! You just cant beat that iconic can! Every one knows you are drinking Pabts Blue Ribbon. The aroma is nice, white bread yeasty and thats just about it. The flavor is yeasty white bread that turns into a copper penny like taste. The finish is medium dry. There is a some-what wine character that is very underlying. This beer reminds me of Milwaukee's best Ice or a weaker version of steel reserve 211. The taste is very Miller like with that miller tang. Good news is There is no corny taste. Moving on, I like the feel of this beer. Very velvety mouth feel especially when its ice cold. Goes down well and you could easily down this in a few gulps. Overall this beer seems to taste a little on the light side for me. The flavor is not complex and at times tastes boring. Its good, Only if it's cheap enough. I bought a 6 pack of 16oz cans, it was over my price range for cheap beer. If the price was bellow $4 I would buy this beer all the time. That being said, get a malt liquor.

A hint of a fresh toasted bagel, with a light smear of Kraft Whipped cream cheese. As the smell reached the back of my throat, I got wisp of caramel macchiato creamer that I put in my morning coffee.    Taste: The taste was something I have never tasted before. As I sipped this beer, immediately I was reminded of Red's Apple Cider. It also reminds me of my child hood, drinking Mott's apple juice on my grandma's lap. As I took another sip, my tongue started picking up multiple flavors: Avocado, Mango,   and small apples.    Feel: The mouthfeel was splendid. Like an enormous raging clue exploding in my mouth. I was foaming but swallowing.    Overall: Would never try again. MMHMM.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 I literally grew up on PBR. The first beer I ever had was one of my Dad's PBRs from the basement fridge. I drank this beer EXCLUSIVELY for 42 years (until about when it started its resurgence, at which point I figured I'd done my part to preserve an American icon, and moved on to craft beers). So much for "living on a beer budget".  I thought it was appropriate to make PBR my 1000th beer on BA. There was an appealing symmetry there, plus I feel that #1000 occupies a position of some significance. PBR deserves it.   Pabst is actually a decent beer. You can drink a lot of it without getting totally trashed, and it's pretty cheap so you'e not breaking the bank either. It was best in returnable bottles (remember them??) but it's OK in cans too. I occasionally run into PBR on tap, which is irresistible (it's not that much better, but hey - it's PBR on TAP!!)  OK, so it tastes a little grainy and maybe it's over-carbonated. But it's a damn sight better than Bud, Miller, or any other macro swill. Hint: drink this stuff COLD. Optimal temperature is when it CRYSTALLIZES when you pop the can or bottle cap. Mucho refreshing!   
look: 3 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 My first Pabst ever! (in Barcelona...)  Had nothing against it, it's a good American Adjunct, didn't wish for more to go with a tapas dinner. No aftertaste, no weird flavor, just a light and watery lager. This is what you want when you want to quench thirst.  Was quite okay (for me, at least).

Looks decent, clear golden color with some fading head and spotty lingering lacing. Smells of grain and corn. Tastes similarly, along with malt and biscuit - actually smoother and less bitter than the typical AAL. Clean finish with good carbonation. I would actually drink this over other AALs in a heartbeat.

look: 3.25 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Look - poured from a 12 oz can. Straw yellow in color, a foamy head that dissipates quickly, though with same lacing. Carbonation is high and bubbles off quickly shortly after the pour.  Smell - very faintly sweet, with also some faint hoppiness. Not much else detected, but nothing unpleasant.  Taste - also light on flavor, but detectable malts well supported by moderate bitterness from hops. slightly sweet and dry finish.  Feel - light bodied, high carbonation, and respectable at around 4.7% for an adjunct.  Overall - in terms of widely available adjuncts, this is one of the best. clean, not overly sweet, and easily drinkable. A nice go to for the hot summer day.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 For the style this is a very good American adjunct lager.     Clear golden with frothy lasting white head with clingy lacing.    Aroma is clean with pils malt sweetness, touch of corn, and light sulfuric note.    Flavor is light but clean and reasonably pils malty through early and mid-palate with a bit of corn sweetness.    Feel is very crisp and light with high carbonation and dry finish.     Easily the best American adjunct lager. I would challenge anyone on BA to put this one up against Founders Solid Gold and FW Lager in a blind side by side and see if people can identify which is which and also which is preferred. I bet it will be 1/3-1/3-1/3 for preference as this one has a bit less malt flavor but a bit more crispness and lighter body for easier drinking.   
look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 Pabst is a very basic lager. It's about as average as beer can get, which isn't a bad thing. There really isn't anything unique about it. It's a very plain beer and I think it's decent.

Aroma is sweet, almost fruity, cereal.    Flavor matches.    Mouthfeel is softer than necessary, but clean and leaves no aftertaste.    Overall they didn't win a blue ribbon for nothing.

look: 2.5 | smell: 2.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 My first beer was this, only beer my grandad would buy.  Anyways, poured a 24 Oz can into a glass, foam initially thick head but dissipates rather quickly with almost no lacing  It smells like most American Lagers: musty basement, corn or grain, slight sweetness. Moderate carbonation.  Taste is nothing too special - can taste the grain and sweetness. Nice thing about this beer compared to others in this style is there is a slight bitter hop note on the back end. I'm drinking it ice cold and it goes down smooth, finishes clean very drinkable. All in all, i would prefer this over Bud or High Life. More flavor in my opinion. This isn't my favorite style of beer so the overall grade is a B-

Smell was worse than I remembered, but what stunned me was tasting it and thinking "what in the world is this crap!" An all around unpleasant taste that lingered far too long, and made me want to at least get a bud light to hopefully get rid of that taste. PBR makes Budweiser seem like a craft beer. I cant believe I used to drink this stuff, and I cant believe there are people who actually like it. Are their taste buds ruined?

Only poured it for the sake of curiosity, just drink it from the can/bottle like you're supposed to. Smells and tastes grainy, malty and a touch of of hops in the back. Pretty nice actually, light and nearly watery but what do ya expect. Good enough for another six pack in my fridge.

I definitely prefer more complex microbrews, but, on a happy hour or low cash flow day I have no issue buying volumes of PBR. This beer has a nostalgia for me. I’ve drank it since i was 12 years old. And, while that’s not appropriate or recommended...that’s what PBR is to me. It’s part of me and there is no better mass brew on the market for me. You could say, it’s in my dna.

Not an attractive can.    Smell - A hidden corn sweetness smell, but generally not much there.    Taste - Interesting sour and bitter grain tastes. Kinda bready or something similar.    Feel - Not too carbonated. Smooth. Easy to drink.    Overall - A clear contender for top AAL, but not quite my favorite. Goes down easy as a background drinker and has enough interesting to focus on.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 2 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 4.25 Too much hate on good 'ole Pabst. Really now...one can't drink heavy and potent beers all the time that are normally highly rated. Pabst is a great beer to just kick back and drink. It's better than Bud, Coors and just about any beer in that category. I usually have a beer such as this as my first of the day followed by a few heavier beers later at night. Get yourself some!

Just good old school American beer that actually is very refreshing on a hot summer day after cutting the grass or during any yard work. I'm surprised that PBR actually has some hop character to it. It's very similar to a Schlitz Gusto classic 1960's formula only a hair milder in hop character. Overall very good and is a few dollars cheaper by the 24 pack than Bud, Miller or Coors

The color is yellow with light carbonation & has a little white head that disappears quickly.  The smell is almost nonexistent, with a little bready graininess.  The taste is like beer flavored soda.  The feel is light with a slightly sticky end.  Overall there is no reason to drink this beer, but at the price it is hard to compete & therefore impossible to argue.

So here that is. I like it, SHOCKER, I really did, or do. And will continue drinking it. It's especially fun to drink while watching Clint Eastwoods movie Gran Torino in which ol' clinty almost drinks more than me. Love that guy. And nice car! Anywut I'd like to honestly say I quite enjoy this beer. All my brothers are bush lovers and it's nice that I can stand out at the family get togethers. I hope my review helps poor old saps find enlightenment, or makes them stray away, more for me. haha drink up me heartiest yoho!   
look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 24 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 2/5/2018. Pours fairly crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Pretty fruity aromas, but not too overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/corn and light earthy hop notes, with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.75%. Overall this is a nice pale adjunct lager. All around nice robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful, never watery for the ABV, and not overdone on adjuncts. Clean pale malt/grains and decent earthy hop presence/balance. A nicely enjoyable offering, and great style example. One of the best macros AALs I have had so far.

look: 3.25 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3 BB 6/18/18, consumed 4/4/18    Pours crystal clear light gold with a small head that left little lacing.    Aroma is the weak link, I'm really trying to focus on bready and grainy notes, but man I keep getting whiffs of dive bars and the streets of New Orleans after Mardi Gras.    Now on taste, I really can't hate. This does have a nice full flavor. I'm kinda impressed.     Mouthfeel is light and thin, but with good carbonation. Really clean finish.    Overall, one of the better regular lagers I've had. I don't drink a lot of lagers and pretty much stick to pilsners when I do, but I'd have to say this has a really nice full flavor even when compared to pilsners. The aroma is totally off but hey, this brew runs pretty cheap so you can't be demanding the world.

Look smell and feel are exactly what you'd expect, but the taste is much better than other beers of this style. It isn't overly sweet, watery, or offensive, it's exactly what a cheap lager should taste like. It's amazing whether you're sitting on the patio on a hot day, relaxing after a long day at work, drinking with a meal, or chugging down tall boys at a party. Plus, it's cheap as hell. I honestly think anyone who hates PBR is probably a snob or just doesn't like beer, as this is beer in its purest, simplest form.

So I have no idea how it looks, but probably straw yellow. Smells like the good old days of college, slugging down Adjunct Lagers by the case. Sweet corn and malt. The taste is actually better than I remember, with a much more aggressive bite than your usual American lagers, and a clean finish. Overall, I am truly enjoying this beer and will buy again when I'm looking for a decent, ordinary lager. Fancy craft stuff is great, but sometimes you just want to drink some plain old beer, and this is one of the better plain old beers.

Some thoughts: This beer has a lot of baggage and hefts a good amount of nostalgia to the point of being a cult favorite. However, if I were to be asked to taste this beer without knowing what it is, I'd say that it tastes like an American Macrobrew-lager, but possibly one of the best of that type. It has flavor and is very clean and refreshing. So, I think that it has a place in my fridge along with the craft stouts, Scottish ales, and craft porters that I mostly drink.   
look: 3 | smell: 1.75 | taste: 2.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 2 What can I say, its an old staple of beer's history. Pours crisp and clear, smells malty yet musky, and tastes of nostalgia.

look: 3.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 Pale yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head. One of the better macros out there and one that I will always enjoy. Refreshing and smooth best in the summer months.   
look: 2 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 4 Don’t take my rating to heart since I account price in my rating. I think it’s definitely important, and as one of the cheapest beers out there PBR beats the brakes off the competition like the miserable Coors or Miller High Life. It’s so much more flavorful at about the same cost, and the feel to it is actually pretty satisfactory despite being frugally created. This is THE go to cheap nationally available beer for me.

look: 3.25 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.75 16 ounce can poured into a pint glass    Pours a clear pale straw color with a bright white head, tons of carbonation, decent retention and no lacing. Subtle aromas of hay, sweet grains, and corn, pretty basic. Straightforward AAL, light on the palate, hint of corn and grains, light bitterness, smooth, crisp, clean finish. Light bodied with a lot of carbonation.     Not much to this beer, has a bit more bitterness than other AALs, overall, probably not something I'd reach for again as I'm not a fan of AAL.   
look: 2 | smell: 1.5 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.5 It does not smell very much. Smell foam head. The mouthfeel is average, no thong to Excel.   Got it from a regular supermarket in Spain. 335 ml Bottle poured in to a pinta glass.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.75 American beers have really gone downhill. Pabst has risen up by doing nothing at all. Very little malt flavor, touch of characteristic weird hops, light & fizzy. I would get this over 90% of the competition.

Over all a really good choice for cheap beer that won't leave a dent in your wallet or a sick feeling in the pit of your stomach after a few. I would highly recommend PBR.

look: 3 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 My go-to when I want a cheap AAL, and don't want to make a special trip to a store that carries Genny, Old Milwaukee, Hamm's or any of the other less-commercially available brands around here. I loved my first Pabst, which I bought when I first became "legal," and have never been disappointed with the brand at all. Do I think that it is so spectacular as to eclipse all of the survivors of bargain brand beer? Not so much, but I'm glad that the brand survives, and that the company has been keeping so many other nostalgic American beers from going out of existence. Long live Pabst.

look: 2.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.5 16oz can into a tulip, because damnit that's all I had laying around at the moment.    Look- Pale straw and crystal clear, just like any other AAL. Some carb bubbles spring to the surface and there's a little wispy head retaining. Basically, the style average.    Smell - Somewhat difficult to gauge as it's so faint: light, mildly sweet corn graininess, light sulfur sharpness, faint whiff of grassy hops.    Taste - Pretty much follows nose: light, mildly sweet, clean corny graininess up front, slight malt presence, a touch metallic, a very slight touch of drying grassy hops, a little sulfurous sharpness, finishes nice and dry with mellow grain and faint grassy hops. Refreshing and well balanced.    Feel - Boy did they nail the body! Carbonation is ample and smooth, a bit creamy, with a bit of a fizzy bite all at once. Feel is medium light and crisp.    Overall - At the moment I'm kind of re-discovering the AAL category and going back to my (not-so-impressive) roots, but I gotta say at the very least, PBR is absolutely not a bad beer, and is actually a pretty good beer for what it is. Like any other AAL, there just isn't a great deal of flavor and aroma, but more importantly there are no real "off" flavors to note - it's smooth, crisp, clean, balanced and just kinda tastes like a beer, which cannot be said for a lot of beers in this style. PBR makes a damn fine food beer, too.

You can actually taste some kind of Hoppiness going on. The only three cheap beers I drink are Coors Banquet PBR and Helleman's old style. But I'll take a Coors or hellemans first.

He stumbled home and told his son of the win. The son asked if he got an award and pops forgot he left it on the bar when he was showing everyone. "No worries", said the son, "I'll go get it for you". To the bar the son went. Upon arrival the bartender said, "What'll you have?" The son exclaimed with glee, "Paps Blue Ribbon!". Okay, it's funnier out loud and only if you've seen the commercial (here you go young Youtubers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQoghzFUT7g ) , so there's that...

look: 3.25 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 Having recently read an online review of PBR against 6 other brands I thought I would revisit it. PBR is a nice, clean, clear, crisp mass-produced brand, and as American as any beer made today. To this reviewer the smell was prevalent but not strong or overpowering. The head was a bubbly white with little or no lacing. The taste was quite good and crisp. The overall feel was pleasing and not all overpowering. Long a major American staple PBR is a quality mass-produced beer and worth sharing with friends.

look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Let's be honest here, it would be unfair to compare this beer to the millions of great imports and micro/craft beers out there so this review is written in comparison with other AAL's.     12oz bottle poured into a lager glass and consumed ice cold. The bottle's label design is a classic and looks good. It's a classic, great-looking can, with a proud description of the beer.     Look: Very pale yellow, some bubbles rising to the surface. Initial one finger head that dissipated to almost nothing except for a thin cover but with good lacing on the glass as the beer is consumed. Nothing special here but I was pleasantly surprised with the lacing.    Smell: I'm getting some corn/grain like aroma but its not repugnant. Not a lot to write about here.    Taste: Not much to write about here but if you were to take a slice of wheat bread and soak it in water, that's what you get with this beer - like another reviewer said. Being as that I consumed this beer while ice cold, most flavors were very muted but I did detect some hop profile at the end. Decent tasting for an AAL.    Mouthfeel: My first thoughts are that this has substantial carbonation. Overall volume feels very light but sort of creamy for the style (which I like). Compared to other AAL's this has more going for it.     Overall: For an AAL, this beer simply has more to offer than the massively mass produced stuff that is seen on shelves all over. It will never compare to the micro/craft offerings as far as overall quality but its a nice simple American beer that is great on hot days or when you simply want to quench your thirst. It'll be something I'll revisit once in awhile for a change of pace.

look: 3 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3 Bland straw-coloured beer with muted flavour and nose. This is not a beer for experts, it's a beer for a hot afternoon after mowing the lawn, or after sport perhaps when flavour, nose, are not as important as slaking a thirst. It pours yellow with an insubstantial white head. The nose and flavour is subdued, the fragrance not a lot unlike what you'd smell through a blocked nose, a touch of sweetness, but negligible taste of malt and hops which unfortunately leaves one focussing on the carbonation for meaningful flavour. Not a lot unlike a beer that was filtered through charcoal and lost character on the way, at best taste is clean and untainted. Easy drinking for the same reason. Thirst quencher, no more, no less.

Not much of an aroma, maybe a bit of corn as the can is first opened.     A bit of sweetness up front, seemingly a bit more candylike than malt, and otherwise pretty muted on the flavors. Stays clean and slightly sweet Into the finish. Maybe a bit of an earthy hop flavor, but very secondary.     Low-medium body, medium carbonation. Mouthfeel definitely built for maximum consumption.    I've had PBR quite a few times while out, but decided to invest $3.99 for a six pack of it today. As any good macro lager should be, it is fairly generic and unoffensive. Clean and bland.

look: 2.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.75 This beer tends to divide the community. I don't really like it but it is not the worst AAL I have had. The look is a typical straw color with small white head. Not much lacing. The nose is corn, hops, and rice. The taste follows the nose but you have to add bread in there too. White bread. The feel is a bit heavier than I thought it was going to be. A PBR does tend to make some snobs judge you but it is still drinkable overall. This beer just makes sense on some of those hot summer days. Not a great beer overall but I still get it from time to time. Yeah, it's OK.

This one has an ad for PBR music on the back, about giving back to local musicians. Pretty cool.    L: Pale and yellow. No real head, but plenty of carbonation, leading to many attractive, rising bubbles.    S: Like a stale cheese sandwich. That's exactly what it smells like. Though not in a bad way, if that makes sense.    T: Soak a slice of wheat bread in tap water, and you'll get the main flavor of good ol' PBR. There is a bit of hops at the end, certainly more than most cheap American beers, and you get a sort of corny/gym socks flavor if you let it get warm. It isn't as bad as all those comparisons make it sound, though. In fact, the mild flavor makes it quite refreshing, and the taste is good when cold, inoffensive when warmer. A simple beer to fall back on when your tongue is too worn out for a hop bomb.    F: Quite substantial for a beer in this style, not too thin or watery, and it goes down smooth.    O: This was my great-grandfather's beer of choice, so maybe I'm a bit biased, but I like Pabst. It's been around forever, and has a heritage worth respecting. You can always count on PBR for simple, cheap, and tasty no-frills beer.

It's drinkable and a sixer can go down easy on a hot day only if ice cold. Not my favorite adjunct lager and easily forgettable, unless there is sentimental value attached.

Unlike some other American bulk lagers, Pabst somehow finds a way to combine the most unpleasant elements of every bathtub beer out there. Thin head; off-golden color, no head retention. Not something to drink routinely. In fact, not something to drink at all unless absolutely desperate.

Whatever was in the can wasn't giving me anything besides a slightly sweet, corny flavor, with a clean finish and the consistency of water. Points for not being offensive like some other AALs, but other than that....

The beer has a soapy white head and a golden colour.    The aroma is barley malt and hops.     The beer tastes of barely malt, grain, hops, and clean water. It is all light tasting. This beer tastes like beer.    PBR is consistent and well worth trying.    The beer is light bodied and the finish is crisp and dry.    You really can't go wrong with Pabst: the iconic label, the quality taste, the consistency of the product...people that knock this don't understand beer.    Give it a try. It's perfect for any occasion but in particular hot days.

Flavor lingers after the finish, hint of metallic taste but noticeable unless you're breaking down flavors. A little surprised, pretty solid beer right there.

Look- Pours a pale and very transparent straw color leaving a few centimeters of white foam behind. It settles relatively quick to form a thin layer revealing a little lacing. Tiny carbonation bubbles can be seen surfacing through the super clean liquid.     Smell- Wet cornflakes, hay, mild floral esters and whole kernel corn.     Taste- Wet grass, corn, floral/perfume, yeast cake and a little sweet malt in the finish.     Feel- Crisp, clean and very light with a slight carbonation tingle.     Overall- A good beer for the style in the under appreciated and misunderstood landscape of American lagers. It's crisp and very clean drinking with a slight floral hop presence that offsets the malt and corn taste. I'm a fan of Schlitz Gusto, this isn't too far behind it in my opinion.

Taste follows the nose along with a slight hop bitterness. Light bodied, well carbonated, watery mouth feel.

The simple, unassuming balance is refreshing. Easy going without being too thin or grassy. I'm on kind of a PBR kick right now. Digging it!

look: 3.25 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 Pours a wheat gold with just a hint of frost to it disrupting the otherwise stark clearness. Head foams up to three fingers in height and white in color when poured straight into the glass. Good head retention with little lacing left behind. Aroma is wheat, and lemon zest, as is the flavor profile. Easy to drink, and incredibly smooth. It has a sort of sugary, sweet quality to the flavor profile. Mouth feel is medium-thin and crisp. Overall, simple, and light, but delightfully crushable.     Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can.

If given the choice between PBR, Natty Light, Bud, Keystone, and Miller, I'd choose PBR any day.

look: 2.75 | smell: 2.25 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.75 After a couple high powered IPAs PBR is a nice little slow down. Tastes better than the more popular adjunct lagers and it helps the budget. This is very nice after mowing the lawn, cooking on the grill or floating around the pool. A perfect shower beer as well.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 For what it is, it's a pretty decent beer. There's no pretentiousness here, it's just a crisp, clean beer. It's actually kind of a nice change to drink a beer that doesn't challenge your palate. It can definitely coexist with the craft beer in my fridge and has it's place, like when I'm preparing dinner or grilling and want a beer. YMMV.   
look: 3 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3 Probably the most drinkable of the mass market, 30 for $12.00 beers available. It may no longer be a staple of Milwaukee, but, it's still my go-to domestic for 25 cent tap night.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 | overall: 4 Look: PBR is a golden shade of amber, crystal clear, it's slowly bubbling with the lightest circle of foam around the rim of the glass.    Smell: It smells like any lager should, much like a Budweiser, except with a slight but pronounced hint of hops.    Taste: Again, it reminds me of a Budweiser or rather Bud lite(somewhere between the two), but with a noticeable taste of hops. I am finding it to be surprisingly pleasant, and I am shocked that a beer in this price range has some complexity and good flavor.    Feel: Of course, being a budget beer, this is where the sacrifice is made. PBR is a litte bit thin, somewhere between a Bud and a Bud lite. Mind you, this isn't off-putting, I'd rather this than the thickness of iced beers.    Overall: PBR is definitely one of the best budget beers you will find. Sure, it won't knock your socks off, but it will bring a little more flavor to the party than some of the more cliche lagers. I am pleasantly surprised, I will definitely put PBR into the main lineup from now on.

Good looking beer.    Smell - Sweet white bread, saltines, tiniest hint of grass.    Taste - Corn syrup sweetness, light bready malt. Finishes "wet"    Feel - Light bodied, moderate carbonation. Not as crisp as I remember.    Overall - An enjoyable beer and good example of the style, though if the sweetness were toned down a bit I'd enjoy it more. Easy drinking.

Aromas of light malt and corn, plus a little herbal grassiness. Pleasantly full-bodied, with a little sweetness and a little bitterness on the finish. Quite good overall, substantial enough to make a good pairing with all sorts of food yet refreshing enough for a stand-alone sipper.

Foamy white head that stands 1 finger tall with low retention,and light lacing.Light gold / straw colored body with very good clarity.Low to medium carbonation depending on the pour.    On the nose I get wheat,sweet corn,and sweet earthy malt notes.A little bit of a metallic smell.    The palate follows the nose with wheat,sweet corn,earthy malts,and a slight metallic taste.    The mouth feel is light,and a little watery,but not bad.A little bit of oxidation on the tongue.    This really isn't a bad beer.This is what I drink when I am low on money,and can't afford expensive craft beers.Much better than Bud,Coors,and all those other big name,mass produced beers in my opinion.

While it's not as smooth as coors light, its just as easy to drink. Definitely a good beer to drink after a long night (even though I party-fouled and spilled some of my beer on the girl that was singing on front of me)

With cheap bourbon, though, it's like drinking fermented cream corn.

look: 3 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3 My teenage beer that I grew up with. A fine cooking beer today that is used in most all the recipes online and on television. This was an all-American beer that was enjoyed for every reason you would want to drink beer. Evening, friends, refreshing, versatile in any cooler. We had great times buying this beer for our horse outings and camping time for summer fires.   After this beer , brewmasters decided to get creative and produce beer with more subtleties that you did not get in the 60's, on up to the 1980's. A rage began to brew more with hop flavor and ports, etc. But PBR goes a long way in most any situation and I salute your for being the number one beer in the Mid-west beyond Budweiser which had more of a green or bitter bite to it at times.   Today this is a college beer known for tap pitchers and special blowout fun priced events.   Back in the day, it was not known as a cheap beer. Today, maybe. Lets say cost effective.  Cheap and inexpensive beer to me is Keystone, Old Milwaukee, Haf-brau. This beer relates right up their with Hamm's - the beer refreshing.

Very pale orange/yellow, with some incredibly robust carbonation and a two finger white head that lasts for at least a little while. The smell falls comparatively short, being dominated by corn, grain, and vegetal aromas not unlike Bud or Miller. A slight hoppiness prevents it from being all 'bad'. The taste is worse than Narragansett, but better than Miller High Life, which are the two AALs I would drink in lieu of PBR on any sort of regular basis. Robust graininess upfront, somewhat watery finish.    67/100

A- Piss yellow, actually resembles sparkling apple juice, with a bubbly white head that quickly dissipated.  S- Sweet, grassy smell with a surprising amount of green apple.  T- Literary just corn and water, not much else to say.  M- Essentially flavored water with a cloying sweetness left in your mouth, although it is very easy too drink.  O- For such a cheap beer it really holds up, which is why it's my go to party beer

For me, this is really nice. It holds its head better than most major AAL beers, and smells of a not-so-bad inoffensive corn smell, slight barley in it... Tastes of sweet corn and then on the back end a tease at some hops, which really impresses me for the style. Feels light and crisp. Aftertaste is a pleasant bready grain. Solid budget beer for a 30-rack that actually has a taste.

Pleasantly surprised. Crisp drinker, with no real faults. Significantly better than other macro lagers.

No idea what it looks like but based off the smell, it probably doesnt have much to offer. There is no aroma. Taste is typical adjunct bullshit - cereal grain sweetness, slight kiss of alcohol and nothing else. Light in body, moderately carbonated and your standard run of the mill AAL.

look: 3.5 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.25 Oh yeah, it's time for some "get drunk" beer.     A: crystal clear straw-gold. Frothy white head, about a finger's worth. The foam lasts about two or three minutes, leaves minimal lacing. The carbonation is pretty active, lots of bubbling coming from the bottom of the glass.   S: Not a particularly big smell. A little bit of grassy hops, a lot of corn. Some of that wet paper smell that a lot of macro AALs have. I don't like that smell. Obviously not a beer where you contemplate the complexities of the nose.   T: Fair. There's actually some hoppiness to it, unlike a lot of macro AALs. Bitterness is the main taste. Not a great deal of malty sweetness, and what sweetness I get is mired with corn. Not bad, though. It's actually pretty tasty.  F: Very clean and crisp. Kind of foamy on the back end, but this does not overstay its welcome. The feel is its best quality.     Overall: for the price point and for the type of beer it is, this is very decent. To tell the truth, I've had lagers from "craft" brewers that aren't nearly as good. This is toward the top of my "beers to bring to a party" list, and, since it's fairly cheap, it's easy to bring a lot to liquor up the crowd. Anyway, enough yapping. I like this beer, but honestly it's better enjoyed straight from the can.     To good health and good beer.

Don't really see bottles that often for some reason. Keeps good head throughout. Always a plus.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 PBR is an award winning and fine beer. Yes, it is an American lager and cannot be compared to a California IPA. The reviews on here which slam PBR, Coors, Miller or Bud are often written by people who know little about beer.     Hipsters now drink PBR thinking they are cool, but most don’t understand it IS a high quality example of its style.    Comparing American lagers to other varieties of beer and claiming they are bad is just like comparing a brand new Ford Taurus to a brand new Rolls Royce. They are both cars, but are totally different and cannot be compared side by side.    Pabst is a fine beer for the style. Again, it wins medals all the time against 'craft' brewers trying to duplicate the style.

Typical straw color. White, foamy head that is gone instantly. Aroma is yeast and grain. A bit of hops bitterness in the taste. A rather metallic, watery mouthfeel, but you can pound them nonetheless. Headache city.

Not much carbonation, a little more than I expected, though not quite enough.    Poured out of my iced coffee cup into my snifler. A delight. Taste is that of very slight malt, little carbonation. Lingering metallic backbone leaves me speechless.     As I pick my jaw up off the floor I go in for another sip. Delicious. Best consumed room temperature to ensure full bodied taste. The best of the cheap beers by a landslide.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pabst Blue Ribbon is my "go to" beer for all occasions. I usually pour from a 16 oz. can into a 20 oz. glass, but if it is an outdoor activity, I drink straight from the can. It is a clear, golden color with a thin, white head. The smell is corn and hops. The taste is crisp and it has a good feel. In my opinion, PBR is the best mass produced premium American Adjunct Lager in the United States.

Cheap, easily drinkable, and the 5.9% variant of it can get you drunk in no time if you drink it fast enough. But beware the headache! Always have some in my garage fridge for those times when I'm watching the game or chilling next to a bonfire. Not the best tasting beer out there, but the memories I and many other people have of this beer makes it awesome.

Middle gold, a little head that subsides too quickly and leaves little lacing. Sweet grain and corn nose, Taste follows, fairly full flavors (considering) but the carbonation is too high for me to really enjoy, and there is also a metallic taste on the edge that I can't get past. Wet and a little messy, but not bad....decent bitterness on the back half, but that's about all the hops bring...very little in the way of flavor. It's been about 5 or 6 years since I've had one of these, and it's about what I remember. Is what it is.

Sweeter than I remember almost like drinking liquid brown sugar water but if you need to drink 6-10 much easier to do than with crafts. My guilty pleasure.

look: 3 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.75 First time I had a PBR in years. 16 ounce can poured into pint glass.    Look: Darker yellow color than most AAL's with rapidly dissipating head. No lacing.     Smell: Alcohol with faint hops and Malt.    Taste: Sweet and kind of weak. You can taste the corn. But it is a bit more malty and substantial than your Buds and Coors. A lot of carbonation. Almost like malt infused soda water.    Feel: Smooth and Goes down easy, if you can get past the carbonation.    Overall: If you are at a social event and you want something that is easy to drink and doesn't taste like urinal water, or if you are on a budget, You could do a lot worse.

So here, for your pleasure, review 2000 from rodbeermunch, you get the veritable classic, PBR.    I guess this one some blue ribbon in the 19th century. Ok.     Well its macro yellow white head that eviscerates itself into about nothing in no time flat. The aroma has a mild amount of grain and corn like sweetness going for it.     The edge of sweetness continues in the taste, almost no hop presence, but that gets kind of bolstered by the high degree of carbonation masquerading as a hop edge. Keeps a light mouthfeel, but its not really the kind of beer for someone looking for pronounced hops and malt flavors. The yeast and corn seems to give some sweetness.     Decent in a hot weather pinch, but ultimately, its no different than the vast majority of AAL macros out there. Long live Milwaukee (or LA at this point).

The beer pours with an average sized head that linger for a decent amount of time. The color of this beer is really nice. It's a bright golden color. The beer has a nice hoppy and grainy smell to it. It smells like a lager. The beer has is nice semi-sweet malty, and grainy taste to it, with a slightly bitter, hoppy after taste. The taste is pretty good overall. The feel of this beer is nice. It feels smooth and slightly frothy in the mouth.    Overall I'd say this is a really good tasting American style lager, and it won't cost you much wither. I bought a 12 pack of it at Safeway for 10 bucks. It is the best tasting American style lager at that price point in my opinion. PBR is one of my go to beers. I would recommend this beer to anyone who is drinking on a budget, yet still wants a flavorful, tasty beer.    Cheers.

look: 2 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 3 Look: Pale yellow, creamy white head  Smell: Fairly weak. Corn, other grains, hint of some grassy hop  Taste: What I expected from the smell. Crisp, clean adjunct grain, faint hops, and fairly sweet.  Feel: Watery, moderate carbonation.    Better than anything else you can get for the price.   
look: 2.75 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3 Poured from a can into a nonic... at least after I chugged the first few ounces. Hey, it was hot outside.    Clear pale straw yellow beer with white foamy head. Head dissipated fairly quickly but did leave a bit of lacing. Nose was fairly grainy, mostly corn smell, but not strong overall. Taste was refreshing, to be honest (the beer was cold), and certainly better than many AALs. It was sharp enough that the corny flavor did not dominate. Mouthfeel was a little sudsy and fairly slick. I don't plan on drinking this regularly -- it is a beer made from corn syrup, after all -- but I've had worse!

look: 3.25 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 2.75 From notes taken 05/23/16:    Extremely clear golden yellow with occasional speck of something in suspension. Larger white, wispy head of weaker retention, but film-forming. Adjunct grain and honey-like aromas. So much corn, a little pale malt, a touch of honey, with light lemony hops. Can detect the alcohol I think. I’m gonna call this medium-bodied, smooth throughout, well-carbonated, sudsy, finishing more tingly, dry, and crisp. Refreshing, far from the worst Adjunct Lager out there.

TASTE: I can't past that sweet corny thing. It's bordering on sickening.  FEEL: Medium thin body, slightly watery. Full carbonation. Not slick not dry, somewhere in the middle.  OVERALL: Good beer ruined this for me. Tastes corny sweet. If you're going to drink it, drink it from the can and ice it down.

Taste is more so on the surprisingly great side, has a nice rich malt flavor with a nice little bit of bitter hop bite. A bit corny, kind of typical adjunct.  Mouthful is clean and smooth, crisp. Very, very drinkable.  Overall, really decent for a commercial adjunct lager. Easy drinkin'

It smells light sweet bread, with a note of sweet corn, but these smells are not too strong. It tastes only fairly sweet, no bitterness whatsoever. The taste is actually very enjoyable, much more than other macro, cheap beers. The mouthfeel is light, fuzzy, and heavily carbonated. This is a great example of what a cheap adjunct lager can be. I would recommend this to all as a cheap session beer of choice, and to all beginners as a good example of a mostly flavorless beer whose flavor (where it exists) is fairly good.

look: 2.5 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 We should celebrate PBR for how far we have come and not for what it tastes like.... because that is not worth the talk.  PBR Looks pale and sickly; Smells like faint malt; Tastes like several grains mellowed by minimum hops; yet finishes OK.    Listed on the "1001", I'm not sure how this PBR achieved cult status because it is so much like other adjuncts.  The reviewers explains how PBR was one of the biggest/best before mid-century and became the biggest retro-beer as crafters started getting their footings in the 1980s and Americans got tired of swill. So, I suppose I got to give extra points for PBR being the anti-establishment brew when it most mattered.

look: 2.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.25 | overall: 2.75 Keeping in mind this beer's price point, I don't think this is bad at all for what it is. Pours a golden yellow color with a decent sized head that actually lasted much longer than I expected and left a foam ring for about half the course of the beer. Smells like macro: corn and grain sweetness, the faintest hint of a floral hop aroma (that's unusual for macro!). Taste is weak, but primarily sweet like corn. There's a slight hop taste, and something a little metallic. More crisp and clean in the finish than I thought it would be. Feel is light bodied with high carbonation, a little rough going down. Slight drying effect from the wisp of hops it has. For $6 (or less) a sixpack, it's definitely not the worst you can do.

Taste- Taste is pretty good with a exceptional amount of hops added for the price.  Feel- Very fulfilling but not very complex.Refreshing but has a bit of gusto at the same time.  Overall-My teenage years wouldn't be complete without PBR.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Before it became the Hipster drink here I was buying it because it was a cheap a good American lager. Overall a nice balanced cereal and grain beer with a good aftertaste. Taste is somewhat creamy for a lighter beer. A classic American beer, straw yellow color, extra carbonation, nice flavor for what it is, and a good price for a pretty decent beer. Has gone up in price since I was originally drinking it so I usually will go with Labatt's or Coors can be about the same price. If this beer is one sale or a good price I will certainly buy for my cheap all day drinking type beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 1.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured out of a 16 oz. can into a one liter beer stein.     Appearance - Yellow color with a slight tint of copper. Pours a nice one-finger head that dissipates in a couple minutes. Good lacing around the glass, and appears to have good carbonation.     Smell - There is definitely a hint of grassy, almost floral hops in the beer. There is also a bready scent to it.     Taste - Immediately, the taste of crisp hops invade the tongue. Not overpowering, but you can definitely taste the hops. The hops seem to be of good quality. I only rate the taste a "1.75", because hoppy beers are not my style.     Mouthfeel - Crisp, clean, spritzy, and watery.     Overall - If a novice beer drinker prefers the taste of Pabst Blue Ribbon over the taste of Budweiser, he may go on to larger hoppy beers such as pale ales. I am not a huge fan of hoppy beers, and this would not be my first choice of beer. But for what it's worth, and for what this beer is supposed to be, this is a good beer. It's very cheap, clean-tasting, and I would recommend it to any beer drinker that is low on cash and needs a hoppy beer.

Clear and golden with streaming bubbles.    Sweet corn with a lightly toasted white bread smell.    The taste is a nice combo of some sweet with a nice balance of barley, malts and a light hop feel at the back.    The feel is oh so refreshing! Playful bubbles from the carbonation dance across your tongue while the finish is so nice, clean and crisp.    When you combine this very pleasant beer with the price of a case of 24 at $15 you really come out a winner. Sure the beer is not going to blow you out with hops or have a lot of hidden fruit or spice flavors. This is just a great beer to pull out of the fridge, crack it while it is cold and enjoy.

I loved the stuff. However, I noticed that the company must have done something to the recipe because over time it tasted awful. There was a skunky, garbage, and despicable feeling to the entire beer. It tasted like a bear pissed in my mouth. I don't drink it no more. It sucks.

look: 2 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2 | overall: 2.5 Expected it to be worse according to the price. Not so bad, it's not a beer that's meant to be enjoyed, more of a beer to refresh yourself, sort of like a soda. If enjoyed cold and fast, it's nice. But if expecting to enjoy it for it's taste gradually, it's not that great. So I think 2.5 is a perfect rating so say that here's a slightly below average beer

Lots of visible carbonation (think of a freshly poured Soft Drink). No lacing.     S- Lager Yeast, Corn, and bready malt.     T- Watery Barley/Corn mixture with a light hop flavour on the finish to give the brew a slight bitterness    M- Light Body with Low-Moderate Carbonation. A little too relaxed on the carbonation but not bad. The lack of carbonation makes it extremely 'poundable'    O- One of the better AAL's I've had thanks to it's nearly non-existent flavour (no astringent corn flavours here) and easy drinking body. No, it's not that great, but it sure beats a Bud Light.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 2 | overall: 3.75 Appearance - This beer pours an extremely clear straw yellow with 3 fingers of foamy head that die down quick. Carbonation is fairly inactive.     Aroma - lager yeast ( spring water) smell, barley, corn.     Taste - Spring water flavor, barley, corn, and some extremely light floral hops give a very light bitterness on the back of the tongue     Feel - light body not much carbonation almost like drinking water.    Overall - This is one of the better AAJ's I have tried. The flavor and aroma dont stand out and the body is the weakest point because of lack of carbonation. With that said the flavor is fine look and aroma follow the style too. Would I drink this a lot? No, but thats personal preference and if you are a lawnmower beer drinker than try this.

Love OtterCreek Copper. I'm a Vermonter lol. I always come crawling back to PBR though. Its light and I love that, it does get bland after a while so I mix it up but its always available which rocks. It doesn't matter what time it is, great breakfast beer, lunch dinner middle of the night haha!    Its nostalgic, American and hands down better than BUD, I bought a 12ver of bud cause it was on sale yesterday and puked my way through it, Pberrs is so smooth and easy on the guts!

Most adjunct lagers taste relatively the same but there is much more going on in a can of Pabst than just cheap beer. I honestly think this beer gets more snobbery from bud light "top shelf" buyers than it does from craft buyers, which says something. It shows that the cheap price is deceiving to price snobs who would be embarrassed to be seen consuming anything considered "cheap," regardless of taste and quality.

APPEARANCE: ultra clear, light golden body with visible swirls of effervescence; the head is spongy, thick and bursting with bubbles of white; hedgerows of lacing is left behind; ... AROMA:immediate apple/pear hit the nostril, along with the awkwardness of oats, hay and beefy biscuit...PALATE: soft, thin, and absolutely evasive in its presence--swift to its end, and the end is bitter; oily with flat carbonation...TASTE: oats and soft malts create a woody, slightly metallic water-heavy profile; otherwise, as soft and nondescript as 24 ounces of beverage can get...a salty cracker sifts its way in as the can drains...OVERALL: as far as blue-color working cans go, one could do much worse than Pabst...I know my father's generation laments the loss of the "old" recipe, but this offering does its job by refreshing without restraint...easy-drinking to the point of slamming....a good-looking can, worth mentioning

I can have a few but after a bit the taste gets a little skunky and tough to stick with. I'd rate it higher if I could consistently drink it but it is pretty sweet and the carbonation goes away fast. But for the price, I won't complain.

It's great to drink a PBR every now and then when you just want something simple. Can't beat the price, less than a dollar a beer in Texas, and one of my spots has tall drafts for less than 2 bucks! Simply put, if you don't like PBR, I don't like you!

Now I'm old enough to remember when I got back from Germany, American beer was cow piss.    Years have passed and I am on the verge of brewing something myself. Probably a Pilsner.     But, we are talking about a beer that costs less per 12 pack than one bottle of a hell-o-beer assortment.    Yes, it is watery, Yes it hasn't much flavor or to put it frankly nothing to offend. It is 5% alcohol. Cheap and available anywhere. American cow piss? I think not.    The Snobbish assholes talking crap about a $7 per 12 pack beer need to get a grip.    It is cheap tastes OK for what it is which is a Miracle in itself. This beer could easily be like Milwaukee's Best. But it's not. This should be obvious to anyone.    BTW it smells, tastes and feels like beer. Especially after about 6 of them.

The beer you remember from high school and college. I wouldn't buy it or drink it on a regular basis. But when I need an American adjunct lager, this has go-to written all over it.

This is followed by a fresh corn aroma, something that I found to be rather startling in an adjunct lager. The taste, again, has that fresh corn taste, with a little bit of malt leading into a nice, smooth finish. All in all not bad, though I'm more of a pilsner person myself in terms of lager.

One thing Pabst has going for it, although this beer still being quite watery and lacking any real body and bite, is the fact that the grain and corn are picked up a little more here, making it a little more tolerable than the other mass-market adjunct lagers out there but at an even more reasonable price.

Standard cheap mass produced beer...little head if poured properly, but, more often than not, you're killlin this brew out of the can in less than a minute so no pouring involved.     Smells of standard corn and grain of all cheap, "lets race to see who finishes first" brew-ha.    Out of all cheap brews, PBR is BY FAR the best in terms of flavor and body....actually has a decent slight bitter aftertaste.

Can't find any in bottles and I can't order any in, so I'm stuck with cans, but at least they make me look a bit more rough around the edges, like a retired firefighter who beats his children. Not much for a nose, but a good taste with a balanced level of carbonation and a soft, cozy mouthfeel that makes me want to pop a hole in the bottom with one of my canines and shotgun it. Smooth as silk and tasty as pie. Can't beat the PBR.

I would hope canned-on, as otherwise that Kroger was sitting on those past-date cans for quite a while before putting them into the discount bin!    Color is a very pale yellow as expected of an adjunct lager, though it does catch the light in a pretty nice way. A good bunch of bubbles constantly rising up from the bottom. Formed a pretty decent-sized head of white foam on top initially (which was audibly fizzy), but that has now shrunk down into a thin layer on top which is breaking up into smaller "islands" right now, with a thicker ring around the edge of the glass and a few trails up the side from where it was before shrinking down (and a bit more as I drink my way through the glass.) Overall, it's a fairly nice-looking beer. Had the foam stuck around just a tad longer I'd probably have gone ahead and bumped this score up to 3.75.    Smell is a mild, sweetish, bready and slightly corny "beery" sort of smell. Nothing comes across as unpleasant in the least, but it's nothing spectacular either. A little more of the corn sweetness was noticeable on the smell when I first poured, but even then it wasn't overwhelming. As I approach the bottom of the glass, I'm noticing just a bit of an earthy sort of smell (and taste) in there, which reminds me a bit of the backyard garden back home shortly after the soil has been tilled, interestingly. This addition isn't an unpleasant one in the least, as odd as it sounds.    Taste is similar to the smell but stronger. It's actually coming across as a lot more bready than the first can I had, interestingly -- more flavorful in general, now that I think about it. A lot of pretty nice bready malt flavor right away, followed by maybe a very faint grassy hop flavor on the first sip (which I'm not really getting after that) and then the corn-like sweetness taking over toward the end. I'm honestly a bit stunned at how much more flavor this has now compared to the first can I had -- in that one the sweetness was the strongest flavor by far and the breadiness didn't stand out nearly as much in comparison, but this one's got a really nice strong breadiness (especially compared to the other AALs and light lagers I've had) that bumps it up a good bit from my first impression.    Feel is the weak point here. In addition to being about as light as expected, this is a *very* fizzy beer, almost prickly-feeling to my mouth. When I mentioned being able to hear the fizzing of the beer's head -- that also applies to when you've got some in your mouth. This is so fizzy I can literally hear it fizzing in my mouth. That said, it doesn't go so far as to be unpleasant -- I just don't like the feel of this one nearly as much as the taste or smell.    Overall, I'm a bit surprised at how much my impressions of this beer changed from the first can/glass to the second. The bready flavors just came out so much more in this one, and the sweetness that bugged me a little when I first tried it didn't seem nearly as strong this time. Based on this PBR can vs. the Corona cans I had recently, I'd definitely rank this one above Corona. I didn't expect to be able to say this based on what the first can was like, but it's probably closer to being in the same class as Red Stripe and some of the better Mexican AAL-type beers... but at around $8 and some change for a 12-pack, it's a lot cheaper than any of them. Definitely better than I expected!

Medium light grainy aromas with crackery and light malty notes. No esters, green apple or hop aromas. Light bodied with high/aggressive yet creamy, refreshing carbonation. Grainy and light malt avors up front with light hop bitterness through the middle. No hop flavors. Finished semi-dry and fairly cleanly with a light crackery afertaste. Clean, crisp aroma and flavor. A very refreshing and drinkable American Lager. Definitely one of the cleaner American lagers out there and at $20.for a 30 pack....you can't miss with this on a hot summer day. When scoring to style, this one does very well.

Atypical yellow corn body, AAL stark white head.  S: Maltodextrin, Dried corn flakes.  T: Carbonated syrup with a feint amount of grain/malt on the palate. This is refreshing, believe it or not.   F: Kinda soapy after a few but nothing to sneeze at. The price per oz ratio is unbeatable. Pabst Blue Ribbon certainly hits the mark.    Very few AAL's outshine PBR. On any regular day Pabst gets overlooked by some heavier micro pales/IPA's with more character, but sometimes you just have to revisit that end of the spectrum in order to appreciate microbrews that much more.

May have to try it again sometime, but for now not very good.

No go! 1.6/5    How Many?: pshhh, I recommend none and have something good, but this a drink all night around a fire beer, don't try to impress a lady by buying her this, unless you're in the boondocks.

Pale yellow with a white head, clear and crisp both in appearance and flavor. A bit of corn and a faint whiff of grassy, floral hops in the finish. A little weird alcohol and sweetness lingers.     I know it is considered a hipster beer but just because some young, ironic dude likes something doesn't mean it isn't likable. Just as one cannot always be right; one cannot always be wrong.

L: Pours a crystal-clear pale straw color, with about an inch of white head that hangs around for a little bit and dissipates, leaving just a bit of lacing on the glass. Moderate visible carbonation.    S: Stewed vegetables, predominantly corn, in the nose. Just a bit of cracker/bread malt coming through.    T: Quite sweet at the front--very similar in taste to an apple cider. The middle brings on a bit of the stewed vegetable, with corn as the the most prominent flavor. There's a bit of tartness in the middle, as well--this, again, lends itself to a cider-like sensation. The back end has more of the cracker malt, a bit of corn, and more of that apple cider flavor. Virtually no bitter to speak of.    F: Light-bodied, quite effervescent, and a bit creamy in the middle. There's a touch of tartness in this one, but no bitter whatsoever. Very clean-finishing.    O: This is one of my favorite American adjunct lagers, right behind High LIfe. It's best enjoyed ice-cold--actually, I would only recommend drinking this one if it's quite cold. Easy-drinking, not too offensive with the adjunct flavors, and well-representative of the style.

The flavor is like most American adjuncts, but because of Pabst's use of corn syrup as opposed to corn, this drinks slightly sweeter than most others in this style. It has a light barley flavor and it's just a tinge metallic. Most adjunct lagers need to be drank fresh out of the fridge, but I can honestly drink this at any temperature.    Easily a go to beer if I'm looking for something on the cheap, since I can get a six pack of tall boys (16 oz) for around $6. It's gained a reputation as a "hipster beer", but I don't particularly care if people consider me to be as such for drinking this. The hipsters are right, because this is one of the best cheap beers money can buy.
