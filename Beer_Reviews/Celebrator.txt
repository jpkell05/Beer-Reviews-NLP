look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Appearance:  Deep dark Amber color with short quickly disappearing head.    Aroma:  Raisins and cookie maltiness. Smells delectable.     Flavor:  Roasty malt, raisin, cookie with a touch of chocolate fades into a warming alcohol and touch of balancing hop bitterness. It's complex, it's smooth, and it's cohesive.     Body:  Medium body with a fair amount of carbonation. On point for the style.     Overall:  This is the bar for Dopplebock as far as I know it. Excellent beer.

Great creamy mouthfeel with good carbonation.    This is my first time having this beer and I'm blown away. Definitely will be getting more.

Creamy mocha head (four finger to thin layer) and stuck lacing that lasted the entirety.    Smell:  Brown sugar/molasses oatmeal. Dark fruit ’n prune. Cookie dough.    Taste:  Roasty, malty, sweet and a little tart. Chocolate. Slight alcohol warmth.    Feel:  Incredibly soft. Smooth and creamy.     Overall:  This is a fantastic beer. Don’t hate me but I actually liked Spaten Optimator better. It might be tied with Weihenstephaner Korbinian. It’s time for a three-way battle. Also I prefer more carbonation/fizz. This one has soft and smoothness like no other. Celebrator costs more and in my opinion not worth spending the extra $.

T: Toasty, a little roasty, bittersweet chocolate, a touch of coffee, big dark fruit, fig, raisin, and plum, earthy, a hint of smoke, and toffee sweetness.

S: very subtle. Smells of molasses and malts but very light. Nothing that really wakes me up or prepares me.    T: the taste on the other hand is incredibly smooth and carries a complexity of sweet molasses and delicious toasted malts. Both sweet and sour in some respects. Both smooth and slightly bitter to the finish. Incredibly balanced and thoroughly tasty.    F:. A thick beer that handles the alcohol content gracefully and yet clears the back of the palate lightly. Big bold malts that get close to the coffee flavors that are encountered in great stouts.     O: A great double Bock. Stays true to tradition and is a fine example of lasting recipes that stand the test of time. This one does not need to be fiddled with. Just has a slight confusion with such a bland scent throwing me off the track.

Not a sweet beer by any means but the roast is very clean and upfront. Classic taste.

Aroma changes as this one warms from freshly baking brown bread to dark fruits (grapes/raisins/figs). Taste is bready, chocolatey and somewhat raisiny/figgy. Feel is smooth, yet chewy; low-medium carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent representation of the style and a great beer regardless. Superb drinkability for the style and one I would gladly have again.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a dark brown with dark red hues. Head is tan with moderate retention. Lacing is minimal but there.  The nose is creamy, earthy, fruity, sweet, toasty and all around malty. Very nice.  Sweet up front. Figs and coffee come to mind. Dark chocolate is present.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy smooth. Carbonation is on the light side and feels right.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a narrow, large pilsner (?) style glass: color is dark brown, amber edges, head is light tan with fine bubbles, head presents 3/4 inch thick and then dissipates to a top with some spotty lacing on the glass edges.     Smell has some quality depth - I think this is an unintended aged bottle - but the aroma has some an aged dark malt with plum like qualities, slight yeast and bready notes, maybe some dark sugar.     Taste is quite good with great depth - dark fruit, plum/raisin, bread, yeastiness, but more in a bready quality (yeast bread flavor), some roast seems to emanate as well.    Mouthfeel is moderate to crisp, still well carbonated after some aging, maybe some mineral qualities but good lingering sweetness seems to dominate.     Overall an excellent doppelbock with a flavor unique to its own - a bit more roast or darker malt than some of the others in the style but it assists with some depth after some aging.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Love this beer! Aroma is mostly of roasted malts with subtle caramel notes. The taste is slightly creamy, very malty.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 This is a beautiful balance between clean aroma, dense malt flavors and creamy mouthfeel. Simple hop additions, wafts of fresh bread, pilsner and dark malt backbone, and smooth lager finish makes this something to savor.

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Dark brown-amber with a massive off-white head. Smells of smoky malt and grainy, sweet rye bread.

This is very filling for a beer. If you like raisin bread that has been soaked in some brandy or rum then you might like this beer. I learned quickly that I am not crazy about this style of beer but it's worth a try if you have not sampled some already. Don't let stray you from trying some more Doppelbocks some of them do get better. Cheers! C

I love the malt with a good mix of cereal and a nuttiness that opens into a sweetness that is not cloying but just enough to make you want the next sip. Almost smells as good or better than it tastes. Delicious! I have not had one of these in years and bought a 4-pack at one of my local Total Wine stores recently. I originally tried it more than 10 years ago because of BA rating and loved it. I love beer and trying new beers but am now committing to learn more about BJCP and Cicerone and learning the vocabulary for describing what it is that I love about beer.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Looks so good, a deep brown mahogany, creamy tan head. Dried fruit on the nose. It's velvety smooth with creamy raisins and brown sugar. Luxurious in its feel. A delectable treat.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from 330ml bottle into glass. No dating information found on label or on bottle.  Dark brown body. Presents clear with red highlights. Light tan head settles to partial cap and ring. Some lacing on glass.  Aroma is darker malts presenting as dark bread, with dark dried fruits. Some caramel and candied sugar.  Taste is slightly sweet bread, with raisin, dates, and prunes. Burnt sugars and dark chocolate. Wisp of smoke.  Medium mouth feel, easy drinking.  Very solid example of beer style. Presents well, drinks smooth, with complex and enjoyable taste.

Smells of roasted, bready malt and dark fruits, fig stands out, with a hint of chocolate. Taste follows the nose, with a rich roasted, dark bread malt dominated taste with notes of fig, raisin, chocolate and toffee. Nice, velvety mouthfeel. An expertly balanced beer. Although the malt is so dominant, there's still a lot of complexity to it and it doesn't feel too sweet or heavy at all.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Poured into a pilsner glass at approximately 55F.     This beer is dark amber in-color, light penetrates around the edge of the glass giving it an almost completely opaque center. The head is foamy, beige in-color, and takes a minute or so to dissipate with little or no lacing through consumption.    The nose is big roasted malt, bready, and subtle dark fruit. The dark fruit is more prominent as the beer warms.     Mouth is full-to-medium-bodied, malty, almost chewy, with some carbonation.    The taste corresponds to the nose, bready, roasty with taste of bitter cholocate, rounded out by smooth dark fruit sweetness in the finish.    Overall an absolutely enjoyable beer that fits the style with a simplistic yet balanced taste of roast and sweetness. I would definitely suggest this to anyone looking for an anchor to the style.

Smell: Pungent sweet notes of banana bread, raisins, leather, brown sugar, hints of cinnamon, and tobacco leaf. Smells like raisin bread in a glass.     Taste: Taste is more subtle then the nose. The attack is all raisin bread with hints of cinnamon. The attack fades out a bit watery to a full body with notes of dates, leather, figs, and light smoke. The finish has a bit of burnt baguette bitterness, molasses, burnt brown sugar, and raisins.     Feel: Medium body. Mild alcohol that build as the beer progresses. Prickly natural carbonation. Sticky sweet but still quenching. Dry finish.     Overall: A Doppelbock that is exemplary of the style. Raisin bread in a glass with slight burnt edges. It’s somehow both full body and sticky while staying refreshing. World class.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This beer pours a dark brown with a moderate head. The aroma features rich milk chocolate, dates, figs, banana bread, mild roast coffee, prune, honey, cinnamon and licorice. The flavor is redolent of fig, date, and prune, with slight bitterness in the form of coffee and dark chocolate, with background baking spice and licorice flavors. The mouthfeel is fairly full with moderate carbonation. Overall this is a world class beer for a reason. The depth of flavor is enormous, and the richness is well balanced with a hint of bitterness.

Bottle of Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock: ABV: 6.7% vol     Nice brown bottle with a lovely old fashioned design and striking label, very nice. Also have a cheapish looking ornament, in the form of a plastic white goat, with it tied around the neck, which is a bit silly, but there you go. A goat of course representing the fact that it is a doppelbock.     On pour got a darkish brown coloured beer, almost black in fact with purple/reddish looking highlights, with a nice decent sized tan head, some good carbonation going on too, and overall the appearance looks pretty damn good. It all looks very appetizing, nice n frothy.     The smell is equally as good. Got a wide variety of smells, was very malty, got some fruity smells of raisins and prunes, and with strong hints of alcohol.    Loved the smell which was strong and pleasant on the nose.    Taste, got some nice creamy tastes and very filling mouthfuls. Nice hoppy aftertaste which can be felt at the back end, nice and manageable.     Can taste the fruits, and, of course, the sweet malts and caramel.    Nice enough, a slow burner and definitely one to relax with and sup.    If there was one negative is that I did get a little bit of dryness in the mouth.  The alcohol is also well hidden, very well hidden.    It’s alright, is very tasty for sure and I got a fulsome feeling. A nicely balanced beer with a lot of flavours to be had.    On the second pint the alcohol was finally hitting me, got the beery taste. It is 6.7% after all, but it is manageable and not overpowering.    Over all yeah its a good beer, not bad and a nice and tasty brew, very drinkable and not very sour or bitter.   Was a bit tipsy after the second pint, but it was easy enough to drink overall.

The beer pours very dark brown with chocolate tan colored head. The head recedes to a thin ring and leaves a hint of lacing. The aroma is toffee, caramel and dark fruit. The taste is semisweet burnt sugar with some dried fruit highlights. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated and smooth. The finish is slightly sweet with a hint of caramel, yet not cloying as it is very cleanly lagered. Overall, excellent. There is no way, for me, to accurately describe everything this beer has to offer. If you start cold, let it warm as the flavors only become more layered and delicious. Recommended.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 2017-12-05  330ml bottle served in a tulip. If there is a date, I don't see it.    Pours dark brown with a slight ruby tint around the edges, medium to small head with a lot of carbonation. Smell is nutty and sweet, dates and raisins.    Taste is not as sweet as it smells (which is a relief for me). The dates and raisins come through more than the nuttiness. A bit of roast characteristic.    Mouthfeel is light, smooth, effervescent. Overall, very nice beer. Not an expert on doppelbocks, though.

Had a distinct hoppiness and dryness that has now acquired my liking.

The pour produces barely 2 fingers of mocha, foamy, tight bubbled, shortlived head that leaves little lacing. Aroma is pumpernickel, toast, toffee, molasses/burnt brown sugar, baked sweet potato, dark chocolate, dark fruit & a hint of earthy hops. Taste is fronted by toasted dark bread, roast, dark chocolate, molasses, baked sweet potato, raisins, figs & roasted nuts. Finishes with a little earthy hop character & a hint of peppery spiciness among the molasses, baked sweet potato, bread & light booze. Aftertaste is earthy, char, sweet potato, dark chocolate & dark fruit mixed with a hint of hop bitterness . Mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, smooth, extremely creamy & silky, lightly chewy, with a nice spicy prickle in the latter half of the sip. Very rich but also very drinkable. A fine example of the style & my go to dopplebock when available.

Two and one half fingers of amber/brown head that lasts to the bottom. Sticky clinging lacing everywhere.    The nose finds a wonderful blend of sweet malts and dark fruits. Add to those some English walnut and raisins. Bready and rich. Some spicy notes.    Tastes of Heaven. Dark whole grain nutty bread combines with huge sweet malts and dark fruit. Maybe plum? Sweet. Touch of hoppy bitterness but still finishes sweet on the palate. Heavy body. Thick and chewy. Mild carbonation.    A wonderful example of the Double Bock style. The best I've had by far. World class indeed! Cheers!

The taste was mainly sweet - malty sweet that is, malty aftertaste, dry finish. On the palate, it sat about a medium, and was slightly sessionable. Carbonation is felt - kinda sharp. ABV felt right. Overall, I say this is dessert in a bottle, and a damn nice one!

Aroma and flavor are full of roast, toffee, caramel, dark fruit (raisin, fig, prune, dark bread, molasses and finally cocoa. Balanced like a goddam champ. Fuller in feel, rolls over the tongue and down the throat in a creamy wave. Would have again and again.

The taste was just as rich - spices, bread, dark fruit, and bready malt. Really focused on the malt without any distracting floral or citrus notes. The yeast is also in the background. A world class beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Best dopplebock I've tasted thus far. Among the better beers I've had. Pours deep red-brown with nic fluffy head. Smells and tastes of spice, dried prunes, raisin, an dark chocolate. Taste is rich and complex, evolving as the roasted dark malts warm in the glass. Medium bodied and rich. A beautiful beer.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 No visible date. DFH Tulip.    A: pours a barely transparent dark mahogany brown with a thick, frothy one finger of sandy head. If there is carbonation, I can't see it.    S: this is straight out of the fridge, but even at that temp it is emanating fruity and malty aromas. My first thought is a cherry tootsie pop after you have lost patience and bitten it open. Red cherries, chocolate, toasted barley sugar (like cheerios), molasses.    T: lightly sweet arrival, turns toastier, then the molasses roast and sourness come through. Much less sweet on the palate than the nose, but still a sweet beer. Lingering clean lager yeast and malty chocolate.     M: this is where this thing really shines. Medium to full bodied, but somehow magically retains this crispness that makes it feel light on the tongue. Slick finish.    O: I have wanted to try this forever, and it was totally worth the wait. A rich and malty sipper that doesn't get cloying. THE definitive example of the style. Salvator has nothing on this.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Served from 330 mL bottle into glass at home. Pours deep brown with a reddish hue, practically opaque with small tan head. Some legs are noticeable on the glass after movement. Strong malty aroma with dark fruit and hints of chocolate and coffee. No detectable hop aroma. More malt and dark fruit flavor and even stronger chocolate, creating a kind of chocolate covered raisin flavor. The dark fruit is definitely not overpowering, in fact the flavor is almost ephemeral: disappearing from the pallet quickly after finishing. No hop flavor is detectable. The finish itself is somewhat sweet but not cloying, with very low bitterness and a small amount of alcohol flavor. Medium full body with low carbonation. Overall this beer is full of rich dark flavor with the smooth crisp clean lager quality expected from a century old German brewer. This beer is very enjoyable, easily drinkable despite the strong flavor and a perfect example of the style.

Very deep brown color with deep amber tinge when hits the light, it tops up with one finger of frothy tan head that stands with good retention before gradually subsiding to a long-lasting bubble sheet atop and leaving some lacing patch and spot. The everlasting effervescence head keeps building upon each swirl.    In a nose, here comes the burst of malty goodness ranging from molasses, caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, dark bread, roasted, dark chocolate, coffee, to toasted biscuit, as well as hint of dry fruit with suggestion of cherry, prune and raisin, yet spicy herbal hop.    It is still loads of malt here and there though the palate sensation with wide varieties of character of molasses, sweet caramel, charred nut, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, roasted, coffee, and dark bread. Also with suggestion of prune, raisin, and cherry while hop bitterness is there at the end with some bite.    The body is full but not sticky with smooth mouthfeel from its moderately crisp carbonation through the palate. Finish is very dry. Such a great Doppelbock, it is crafted with full malty affair.

Despite its dark color it is clear. There is not much of a head but the thin layer stays most of the drink. I get a nice sweetness of malts and caramel and dark cherries. It follows the nose but not as sweet. The berry or cherry tartness stands out a lot more and a slight bitterness. The beer does have a nice carbonation feel to its medium body.

Tastes very malty and dark with rich caramel, toffee and molasses notes, slight chocolate, coffee, toasty brown bread, raisins, dried fig, pear, apple, grapes, with earthy herbal grassy pine.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 12 oz bottle with the goat "necklace" poured into a pint glass.    Presents as a dark brown, nearly black, translucent liquid that appears to be roughly the consistency of milk. Puffy, off-white head fizzles away rapidly, leaving just a light lacing on the glass.    This one smells of dark berries again, much fruitier than the Troegenator. The aromas are noticeable from over a foot away from the glass. As it warms a bit, a sweet milk chocolate aroma starts to push through.    This is definitely more bitter than the Troegenator. Quick attack of fruit esters (blackberries maybe?), followed by dark chocolate bitterness and some roasted coffee notes that linger through the finish. As I drink some more, the bitterness fades a bit and is replaced by another flavor, like a mild sourdough bread, and some fresh green grapes, that cleans up the lingering coffee.    Feel is medium to thick, a little thicker than milk, with medium-to-light carbonation that gives just a bit of fizz in the back of the mouth. The feel lingers on the tongue for a while, along with some of that sourdough.    Overall, this is super tasty and way more complex than I was prepared for. I was put off by the coffee flavors at first, and I was glad when they faded into the dark fruit sweetness. I really enjoyed this, although it's definitely not for regular consumption.

Flavor is heavy malts with bread, molasses, chocolate, caramel, and dark fruit galore. Feel is so smooth and creamy, liquid velvet carbonation. Outstanding Dopplebock, not sure why it took so long for me to write a review.

The palate follows the nose with dark roasted malts,and dark sweet breads in the lead,accentuated by some fruity flavors.    The body is full,and on the border of wet and dry.

I am not getting the aroma like others have reported . . . just faint toasted malt. The taste is surprisingly non-complex for such a highly rated beer. The taste was more one dimensional and only of malt with a slight bitterness on the tail end. Medium-heavy body with a lighter fizzy carbonation. Not sure what is going on. I was expecting a much more complex brew and am considering this tasting as a potential fluke. I will try again . . . :(

One of my favorite aspects to this beer is how the slightly effervescent carbonation and lager mouthfeel serve to allow the flavors to punch through. Classic.

Aroma: chocolate, roasted malts, smoked wood, fresh bread, delicate dark fruits, but in a different way than belgian dubbels, for example. Amazing.    Taste: tastes like it smells, with a distinct cocoa/chocolate flavour that is really great. A slight fruity sweetness backed up by some bready notes come through and complete the beautiful experience.    Mouthfeel: alcohol not noticed. Low carbonation makes up for a somewhat watery but full of flavout mouthfeel. Bitter chocolate aftertaste. With a little more of body it would be a 10.    Overall: my first doppelbock ever and feels like I've waited too much to try this. Great beer, would get my hands on it almost everyday if it was available around here. Unfortunately, it isn't, so I'll have to try the Paulaner Salvator and be satisfied wit that.

This time around; things start out nicely, deep Ruby hue with a finger-width head, reducing to a small pool of foam. Not much lace to speak of. Smell is all malt; sweet, nutty, bready, yeasty. Rich and flavourful brew; heavy caramel malt, toffee, raisin, fig, chestnuts, hazelnuts, light coffee, baked bread, cherries, so much goodness. Toasty bread lingers in the finish with sweet caramel candy.     Rich, medium body goes down smooth and leaves you wanting more. This excellent brew deserves a proper meal pairing. Simply one of the best, so glad to finally return to this when I can fully appreciate it.

Great looking label, it pours beautifully with a brown/ black body and a beige head. Aromas of caramel & smoked malt. Taste is of caramel, chocolate, cocoa & smoked malt with a medium body. Aftertaste is of a smoked malty caramel. Outstanding Doppelbock, and one of the best beers I've ever tasted.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Here is the top of the line of Doppelbocks in all around taste and quality. The other Doppelbocks just don't quite measure up to it. I buy mine at Kahn's in Indianapolis, where it is fresh with continuous turnover. I don't care so much about how a beer looks, smells, or feels. I just like the Celebrator taste, which is marvelous. It has a full body and well balanced ingredients. Most of the beers throughout the European countries are mediocre at best compared to many of our American craft beers, but not this one.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Incredibly dark brown in color with slight hues of red. Supports a fluffy tan head about two fingers in depth. Hints of dark chocolate and coffee beans along with caramel in the aroma. Mouthfeel is a medium body. At the forefront of the taste is a nutty character, more similar to toffee than caramel. Then you get subtle waves of chocolate, vanilla and maybe a little oak. Towards the end you get a roasted coffee bean flavor with the lingering roasty bitterness. The toffee/flavor is slightly more predominant, but the flavors all mix very well and one does not completely overpower the other. Really great doppelbock.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Picked up a single in late May from Glendale BevMo for $3.99. No visible bottling date.    Beer poured burgundy brown with a nice white head that is leaving some lacing behind.    Nose is liquid bread, sweet malty goodness and dark fruits dominate.    Taste follows the nose, very much wheat bread, dark fruits, very soft and wine like.    Feel is medium bodied and very smooth.    Overall a world class brew that is truly a treat if you are into bocks!

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 From a 330ml bottle, undated, served in a cervoise.    Pours a deep mahogany with ruby highlights and a finger-and-a-half of silky brown head, short retention, no lacing.    Smells of toasted oatmeal bread and brown sugar, roses and vanilla.    Tastes like brown bread, molasses, chocolate caramels and dates. Finishes with a little burnt sugar-roasted chicory bitterness.    Feel is medium-thick and slick, meaty and chewy. Carbonation is vigorous out of the bottle but disappears almost entirely within a few minutes.    Overall, a super-satisfying, smooth-drinking beverage. I feel like I've just finished a small meal rather than a bottle of beer. Definitely on the list of beers to have again.

Smooth with a malty scent. Not sure of the aftertaste, though. Kind of bitter. I like that it doesn't coat the tongue . . .this makes it easier to move on to another beer, a different style.

look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 My apologies to all the doppelbock lovers out there, take this review with a grain of salt (no wait, that's a gose). Comes out dark with those burnt dark copper undertones. Aroma is a lot of roasted dark fruit and solvent like alcohol feels. Some smoke.    Waves of belgian yeast, spice rack, alcohol, overripe burnt dark fruit and malt.     Kinda harsh man, thought this would be a smoother drinking experience, just comes across like the average doppel to my tastes.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 L: Large foamy head that faded down to a thin, creamy tan head. Body is dark brown and let very little light through.    S: Malty but not super aromatic.    T: Brown sugar and toasted bread. A little bit of hoppy bitterness. Flavors are very well balanced.    F: Full bodied and a little creamy. Light carbonation, enough to notice but not enough to "bite" making this drink very smooth.    O: Wow now that is a beer. I recently joined BA and started doing reviews and have been wondering, "What does a 5 rating taste like to me." I just found out. Flavors and mouthfeel are perfectly balanced. This may be my new favorite beer.

Minimal lacing.    S - Chocolate and dark bread, mild sweetness throughout. Possibly hint of coffee as it warms up.    T - Milk chocolate in the front turning to dark chocolate on the way down from hop bitterness. Slight pine flavor from the hops in the back of the palate.    M - Medium body and carbonation. Fits the style and flavor well.    O - Very nice and smooth, not a huge range of flavor or aroma but what it has is excellent. Easy drinker for the alcohol content.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 From a well chilled bottle, pours dark almost black with a thin tan head. Aroma is totally malty. Taste is similar (a sweet malt) with like molasses flavors. With fairly little carbonation, It has OK "body" and I might persuade myself that it has a creamy smoothness. Some folks feel it's inappropriate to compare beers of different styles ...but... any decent Oatmeal Stout is superior to this in terms of: creaminess, full body, and smoothness.

Brown sugar, plums, raisin, and caramel. Mix of darker fruit and sticky sugar.    T: Follows the smell. Tastes a little better as it warms. Good.    F: Thick. Good.    O: Solid beer.

Lots of flavors going on, plus the little goat is a nice touch!

Mouth is surprisingly a little thin biu the body is medium overall.    Very nice this one. Nose and palate are complex and it's nicely balanced.

Smell is heavy yeast and pronounced malt. Caramel finish with fruity esters. Tastes very similar to smell. The malt is strong in this one, in a good way. Gives off a sweet flavor, with refreshing grape. Flavor is complementing by a great mouthfeel. Creamy beer with a light carbonation. Carbonation mixes well with the grape that is reminiscent of sparkling wine.

At the brewery Gasthaus in Aying. It was served in a Pilsner glass and I neglected to ask if it was "vom Fass" or "Flasche". I believe it was on tap. Very dark, slightly reddish color with a tan head. Great aroma of coffee, toffee, slightly spicy...obviously a lot going on here. First taste is all malt and a raisiny sweetness that immediately reminded me of a Beerenauslese wine I had drank the day before. Hard to find much hops presence other than the appropriate bitterness. I'll bet the IBU's on this are actually pretty high. Just overpowered by all that malt. Not quite as sweet as the Kulmbacher Eisbock I had on the same trip but definitely a little sticky. This was a bedtime beer on this day and I can report I slept well!

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 First ever review-- fittingly, done for a classic. 11.2 ounce bottle, with no freshness date, poured into a pint glass.    Large creamy head that dissipates quickly with little to no lacing. Deep, ruby hue which is only visible at the thinnest part of the glass-- otherwise, completely dark.     Fruity esters and grape rinds with no hop smell noticeable. A sticky sweetness is driving this beer's smell, but not in a bad way. Hay-like malt underneath it all.     Alcohol hotness is forces its way to the forefront, followed closely by a raisiny sweetness and plum, but then again with the hotness, which becomes almost rum-like as the beer warms. Heat and raisin collide in a way which is reminiscent of a cinnamon raisin bagel. Definitely a predominately malty beer, with a tad bit of noble hop presence if you really are looking for it. Some cola beneath it all. Big, loud, and chewy flavors at all phases.     Thick and creamy, with a denseness that lingers once the moderate carbonation is long gone. A meal in a glass.     This beer is sweet, hot, and not the cleanest; but somehow, these generally negative attributes meld perfectly to create something exceedingly nice here. Truly a one of a kind brew. This beer is the well-deserved flagship of a style which doesn't get enough attention.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 330ml bottle into a small weizen glass. Paid £2.70 for a single bottle.    Pours a dark, almost opaque, mahogany body with plenty of red highlights near the edges of the glass, small amounts of fine streaming carbonation become visible when held to the light. A two-finger in height, dense, foamy, tan coloured head quickly reduces to a thin film and collar, leaving behind small amounts of soapy lace.    The rich and robust nose primarily comprises of dark roasted malts and lightly sweet fruity esters. Very faint hop bitterness and traces of alcohol are also detectable in the background. Taste follows suit. Sweet, dark, bready malts and dark fruits combine to lead the flavour profile upfront. Raisin-like sweetness transitions to complex roasted profiles around the mid-palate, as subtle hints of dark chocolate, roasted coffee and nuttiness develop. Towards the finish, mild, dry, roasted bitterness and subtle woody, herbal and spicy hops expertly balance initial malt sweetness. In the mouth, a medium to full body and soft carbonation give a luxuriously smooth and velvety feel. Lingering roast and hop profiles along with touches of alcohol warmth give a long finish, drying the palate to become lighter and crisper towards the end.    Overall this is an excellent beer. Hugely complex, beautifully well balanced, and both rich and malty but still crisp, dry and easy drinking. Recommended.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bottle into a chalice. Pours dark brown with a two finger head after a medium-aggressive pour. Minimal retention on the glass. Smell is strong dark fruits and malt, raisin and plum being in the front. The taste follows the smell with a very strong raisin flavor. Also present our plum, malt, and even some caramel. A deep breath picks up some alcohol flavor and smell. The mouthfeel is medium carbonation and very smooth. This beer goes down very easily with a great, complex, deep flavor profile. Overall this is an excellent beer, worthy of the high ratings.

The figgy Smells, the opulent malty Tastes and the soft, luxurious sitting on the tongue is all something that does not last long enough and should happen more frequently in a better world.    Celebrator is the most celebrated doppelbock. (Double the number of BA ratings of the style's #2 and comfortably ahead of its competitors' in average rating.) As such, it is reviewed and praised in Roger Protz' CAMRA classic" 300 Beers To Try Before You Die!" It also is reviewed in the "1001" and most certainly deserves to be on the list.     But sealing the deal is MJ's 1999 "Guide" -- while giving it only 3 of 4 stars -- his words over-flowed the cup: "This outstanding example of the style is a beautifully balanced beer. Its figgy, coconut-like sweetness mellowing out in a long, spicy (cinnamon? ginger?) finish." Note the parentheses are his (or his editors) to connote that subtleties exist that sentences should not attempt to describe ... and, I believe, this is a practice that seems lost on this century's interactive reviewers... including me, when I fail to make the effort preciseness.    11/22/18 Returned to an old friend to gird me for Thanksgiving dinner with the in-laws. I even saved some Celebrator for pecan pie. Nobody roasts malt like Aying. Lots are trying. Very, very few will come close.

Proud member of the Doppelbock Aristocracy. Beautiful dark color, enticing aroma, full malt flavors that almost outrun my thoughts as I attempt a description. Just a beautifully balanced, complex flavor.

Taste is dark fruits and molasses, but again, duller than expected. Overall, a very good beer, but no nearly as good as Andechs doppelbock in my opinion.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 L: Pours a dark brown with some hues of ruby. a creamy, light tan head recedes quickly to a fairly scant collar.    S: Plum, raisin, roast, slight coffee, molasses, caramel and a slight bit of spice.    T: Largely follows the nose: plum, raisin, earthiness, bread, molasses, spiciness, caramel, perhaps a slight chocolate note, tobacco.    F: Full bodied, a fair amount of prickly carbonation, creaminess in the mouthfeel allows for a very enjoyable drinking experience. Finishes fairly dry, but does accumulate some stickiness over time.    O: A very nice doppelbock. The taste is delightfully complex.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured into Pilsner glass. It pours a rich cola color with a foamy, one-finger, khaki-colored head and lacing. It smells of roasted malt, pumpernickel bread, and a whiff of caramel. There is also a faint smell of raisin and tobacco. It has a rich, complex flavor featuring roasted malt, molasses, raisin, caramel, and burnt coffee. The flavors blend beautifully. There is only the slightest hop presence and virtually no bitterness. The feel is creamy with only slight carbonation and with an ABV of only 6.7% it is incredibly easy to drink. Celebrator is a complex and delicious beer that would stand up to a rich meal but is also terrific for casual drinking. It's an absolutely world class Doppelbock.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Serving Type: Bottle  Consumed: 4.2.16    A: 4.5 Extremely dark brown, almost black with a little red around the edges. The two-inch tan head has good retention and leaves a little lace in the glass.    S: 4.25 Aromas start off with a bit of oxidation with pretty strong roasted malt coming next bringing molasses, soy sauce, and cardboard. Mild grain and yeast are there too, but much subtler than the malt elements.    T: 4 Flavors tell a similar story with pretty strong malt, molasses, and some coffee. Pretty nice balance of sweetness and bitterness at first, but bitterness seems to linger with more hints of oxidation.    M: 4.5 Nice body and really excellent carbonation. Pretty thick but not too much for the style.    O: 4.25 I think this might be an old bottle because I’ve had this in the past and been kind of blown away before. I recall much more going on with great balance. This is still good and I’ll be seeking it out in the future to see if this is just a slightly ‘off’ bottle.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 A: SRM 35ish; deep and dark brown nearing black. Copious tan head.  S: More toffee than you can shake a stick at. A little roast but almost all crystal malt. Makes your mouth water.   T: More complex than the nose; more dry roast up front with some bready character but that gives way to more caramel that finishes long and elegantly. The hop balance is perfect; neither too sweet or bitter. You breathe out burnt sugar but in a good way like creme brûlée.  M: Coats your entire mouth with all the above flavors and lets them linger forever. Viscous without being thick...so good.  O: I'm so glad to revisit this beer and know how available it is. After having so many doppels this one might be the supreme representation. It has something for everyone; it's intensely flavorful without overpowering with a perfect balance of characters. Aventinus will be my fall go-to for the spice but for the price and perfect flavor you can never go wrong with Celebrator for an amazing bock.

Very strong malty smell and tastes about the same. This beer is unbelievably smooth, barely carbonated. It can be dangerous because it is so smooth and easy to drink. Gives an incredible buzz.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Very heavy malt flavor, almost a bready molasses heaviness hits the palette with a major BANG! SORGHUM is the flavor that comes to mind.

Bready aroma, with notes of dark fruit - prune, raisin, fig - that carry over to the palate. Also some caramel sweetness, with a little burnt-coffee bitterness on the end. Finish is quite clean, good balance, not much residual sweetness. Outstanding, and an excellent example of why the doppelbock is often termed "a meal in a glass."

look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Luckily this beer is widely available in the Milwaukee area. The first one I had I did not know what to think because the overwhelming initial malt smell almost made me sick to my stomach. After getting over that and trying the beer; just pure greatness. To me it tastes like a sourdough raisin type hybrid. It is a strange beer: I could chug the entire thing no problem it is that easy drinking; but then when you sip it slowly the rich flavor really comes out. One day will get to Germany and try it fresh (if that is a thing). Do yourself a favor and put down the overhyped imperial double IPA that tastes like cheap booze and get one of these bad boys. You will not regret it.

Nice tan head that dissipates with some minor residual film.     Smells like freshly baked bread and malts. Taste is of roasted malts and bread some minor molasses notes. I did note an almost metallic undertone to the beer. Beer has a decent amount of carbonation, very light feel to the beer, very drinkable and hides the ABV quite well.    Overall a really good doppelbock, supremely drinkable and very flavorful.    Revisited 2/4/16. No metallic taste, incredible flavors, lovely beer.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 From notes taken 03/13/16:    Clear but very dark red-hued brown, fairly viscous. Head is creamy and fine-bubbled. Only moderate retention at first but leaves a film for the duration. Smells like dark fruit, especially dates, but some berry suggestions as well, lots of brown sugar, a little molasses. Toffee, dark fruit, molasses, anise, toast to the taste. Any hops in this are all but lost in light roasty/smokey character. Booze is well-disguised, even when it comes to warmth. Full-bodied, syrupy, loaded with fine suds, velvety.    Very good beer, probably the best Doppelbock I've tried so far. So good I went out and bought some more less than a week after making my initial notes. Alas, the one I reviewed here was a 7.1% ABV and I probably had it for a year already, whereas the new ones are all 6.7% and fresh. Not anywhere near as good, I've already tasted one, will review one of the next three in an update to this review. Not awful either, fortunately.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Nice dark amber colour, big bubbles and a one finger tan head that looks like its still fermenting.    Big malts on the nose, lots of molasses and pumpernickel, black licorice, leathery.     Taste is almost exactly like the nose, dark rye malts are overpowered by black strap molasses, definite earthy hop presence to provide some balance. Lingering anise and herbal bitter touch at the end. Plenty of warming reminiscent of a Jager shot.     Nice bright carbonation keeps the powerful flavours dancing around and feeling light. Feels like a medium light body and doesnt leave any film on the tongue.    As advertised, big malt flavours with the warm booze of a dopple bock. This has a very distinct molasses and black licorice character that sets the Aying apart. Not exactly a flavour I love but works well enough together with the rest of the flavours.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from 12oz bottle into standard pint glass. No bottle/freshness date to be found.     L: Deep dark brown with a red hue, absolutely gorgeous. Massive head of a light brown color. Best retention I have ever seen.     S: Molasses, caramel, toffee, bready, herbal hops, and alcohol.     T: Large malt presence taking the form of molasses, burnt toast, dried plum hints with herbal hops, and a hint of coffee. Delectable.     F: Slightly chewy, smooth, creamy. Light-Medium bodied.     O: The #1 Doppelbock. Hands down.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 A: [4.25] Dark. It looks black but has brilliant red hues when held up to a light. Looks blood red. Forms almost 2 fingers of dense khaki head. The bottle lists the ABV (6.7%). I can't find date info.    S: [3.75] Caramel, toffee, tobacco. Lots of sugary malt aroma.    T: [4.00] Follows the nose with more caramelized malts. The caramel flavor is smooth and not overly sweet. More toffee (but no tobacco). Has a complex brown bread flavor.     M: [3.75] Creamy and smooth with medium body. Has a hearty malt finish.    O: [3.75] This is a nice robust beer. Hearty malt bill all of the way through. The mouthfeel steps up the beer another notch. I really like this one, compared to other German styles. Lots of complexity. Good malt bill. It is almost a malt bomb - where a lot of the brews I drink tend to be heavy on hops.

S: Sweet delicious banana bread and molasses  T: Molasses, bananas, sweet malty backbone with minimal hops, raisins  F: Better than many stouts I've had. Luscious. Some might call syrupy, but carbonation is perfect.  O: Drink this beer. It is good and wholesome. A classic that isn't overpriced and is approachable to even people who may not think they like beer. The over-hopped beer fad of the early 2000s is a shame when balanced brews like this find complexity without relying on IBUs.

Pours a very dark brown with sexy amber-red highlights when held to the light, and a thin cap of mocha head that leaves crumbling gothic archway lace as it recedes.    Smells of sweet dark fruit, molasses, sugary coffee, banana and mild bittersweet chocolate.    Tastes of chocolate coated raisins, burnt brown sugar, faint cold coffee, ripe banana and more mild baker's chocolate. Faint leafy hops.    Feels soft and smooth. Medium-full bodied with velvety carbonation. Finishes off-sweet.    Verdict: Vigorously recommended. One of the best I've ever had.

It doesn't need to be loaded down with hops or spices to taste full and rich - it conforms to the Reinheitsgebot, for heaven's sake!

Don't know how they do it.   Having said that, this is not really my style. Less harsh than a stout but then a bit too watery and somewhat oily as well. I was quite surprised to see the high rating but happy for the brewery.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 LOOKS: Dark brown, Nice ruby shimmer up to the light. Big creamy 3" tan head that leaves nice lacing down the glass. Can't really see the carbonation level.  AROMA: Very sweet malt, cocoa, milk chocolate, slight crusty, bready, sourdough bread, and a little bit grassy.  TASTE: Just as aroma. Sweet, with all of the flavors from the aroma and a nice little bit of bitterness to give it a bit of balance. A slight grassiness.  FEEL: A little slick, oily, but finishes more on the dry side. Carbonation level is average and adequate.  OVERALL: A very pleasant DB, no doubt. I find the Weihenstephaner DB a little less sweet and more balanced. This one is slightly too sweet, for me, but not cloying. Nevertheless, a great brew.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Look: The beer has a dark brown body, a two-finger mocha head and a copper leg. Of all the German beers I have tried, this one has the best head retention. It recedes to a layer of a few millimetres. By the time one is about to finish drinking the beer, the head will have a few small holes.    Smell: The nose has a mild note of malt. It is a tad reminiscent of chocolate milk. There are no trace of hops in the aromas.    Taste: The palate is almost a replay of the nose. It is very malty and because it is dark, it has a slight toasty taste which makes the beer taste like a toned down Schawzbier. The dominant note was that of caramel, chocolate milk and dark fruits. True to the style, this beer was neither bitter nor dry on the finish.    Feel: The beer is light-bodied and is not astringent. It has a juicy feeling and it is fresh. The warmth of the alcohol can be felt, but it is very low. It doesn't burn the throat. There is also no carbonation.    Overall: This was love at first taste between this beer and me. Despite having an ABV that is comparable to an IPA, this Doppelbock's alcohol is barely felt. Moreover, this is one of the few beers I have tried that comes so close of being to style as per the guidelines of Beer Judge Certification Program.

Plums, raisins, figs brown sugar, with a slight breadiness.     Taste: Malty, slightly sweet of toffee, brown sugar, molasses, sweet espresso, subtle chocolate and plums. Exceptionally smooth going down.    Mouth feel: Subtle carbonation, full bodied without being syrupy, malty with a very clean finish.     Overall: An exceptional Doppelbock. Very smooth and tasty. If you like Doppelbocks this is a must try. Difficult to have just one.

Poured about a finger and a half of creamy head, which stuck around for a little while. Little bit of light sneaks in at the bottom of the glass. Heavy lacing.     Smell: Very Sweet. Dark cherries, apples, plums, dark fruit. Very slight hint of milk chocolate on the back end.     Taste: Cherries, chocolate, slightly bitter. Little hint of booziness. Very complex and very tasty.     Fell: Slightly heavy. high carbonation. very nice warming sensation, which is surprising considering the relatively low ABV.     This beer is very well done. Chocolate and dark fruits are present on the forefront, with a lingering boozy bitterness. This doppelbock is worth seeking out.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a dark ruby red brown body with a soft head of light tan, almost resembling as if it were on nitro, without as much head.    Aromas of dark fruits; plums, figs, some breadiness, cocoa.    A sweet malty body up front gives way to a slightly subtle sourness, for lack of a better descriptor, that doesn't last too long. Tastes like a dark chocolate covered plum or prune. Very tasty.    Medium to full mouth feel, has a lovely velvety smooth feel to it.    Overall, it's easy to see why this is the top dog when it comes to Doppelbocks! I will definitely be drinking more of this in the future.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Drank from a stemmed Ayinger pokal glass after being poured from a 12 ounce bottle.  Appearance: Very dark brown with a hint of red hue. Head was initially moderate-to-large but quickly dissipated.  Smell: Subdued/faint malty aroma.  Taste: Chocolate and malty flavor. Extremely smooth going down.   Mouthfeel: Light carbonation with heavy body.  Overall: One of the best beers that I have every tried. An absolutely delicious beer that does not overwhelm the palate.    Ironically, while vacationing in Munich, I visited the Ayinger Brewery, and while there I asked specifically for this beer (after reading its glowing reviews on Beeradvocate.com), but they told me it was not the right season (I was there in August), and they do not serve this beer until early spring. It was not until I returned to America when I was able to try this beer for the first time.

A lot going at once, in both aroma, taste and mouthfeel.    No bottled on date or best by.  I can only imagine how this is fresh. Unfortunately most German beers collect dust on the shelves here.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pours a clear, medium brown into a snifter. Body is very dark, almost black; light is allowed to pass through though and reveals deep crimson red highlights along the edges of the glass. The head is a light khaki color, thick and rocky, that quickly recedes to a thin ring. The nose is very inviting, notes of dark toffee, prunes, dried figs, cocoa, roasted chocolate malt, fruity yeast esters, brown sugar, and toasted tree nuts. The mouth feel is excellent, lots of carbonation, pleasant malt flavors with no bitterness and a clean aftertaste. The taste is all malt, sweet complex notes of caramel, toffee, cane sugar, molasses, chocolate, and dark fruits. The yeast rounds everything up nicely, blends it all together flawlessly. A perfect example of the style.

Had a friend that's new in beer tasting and this was his first time with a doppelbock. He started and I could see in his eyes that he was experiencing something great. The same reaction in my GF eyes so I tasted it. Very wonderful coffee and christamsish taste. I had found one of my top 10 brews if not top 5 and putting a couple of bottles in my special stock rack. Go Ayinger.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Purchased at the LCBO for just under $4.00 for a 330ml bottle. Served at 6deg C in a tulip.    A- Opens well and pours a tiny 1/2" high light brown head that films out within 1min or so. Very, very dark brown colour. So dark I can't tell if it's filtered or not.    S- Lacking here. Has a ton of malt but that's it. Slight spice.    T- Very complex brew. Spicy. Cinnamon, cardamom, molasses and sugar.    M- Thick and rich. Heavy body    O- Very good brew. Has a nice complexity that opens up as it warms. North America is NO WHERE NEAR the Europeans for this style of brew. Guess it's a trade off.    Food Pairing    This nice little brew went very well with...... Salted pork rib tips. No sauce, just salt and pepper.     Enjoy

The smell of roasted malt comes right across the table at you. Besides the malt, you pick up a bit of sweetness, like caramel. Taste is everything you'd want in a Doppelbock - malts, malts and more. Rich and warm aftertaste with very moderate ABV. Let warm to a cool room temp. Deserves every BA point it gets.

Comes with ram medallion, readily available and affordable at WFM as single. Beer pours a dark amber/brown body with 1 finger tan head that dissipates slowly and reveals lacy carpet of bubbles.     S. Figs. Aroma is dark sweet malts with dark fruit, as well as roasted smells. There is a dominant, complex fruity smell that leans into fig, fruit cake, cherry, kirsch, brandy, cedar.     T. Follows and increases the smell complex. The taste reveals the darker (fig and plum) flavors. There are some sweet malts, mollasses, char, roasted malt and some floral hop bitterness. Syrupy, and rich, meditation beer. Better as it warms, as complex as old world church.     F. Syrup weight that smooth yet refreshing. Despite complexity which is good for after dinner (as it is for me tonight) probably great with any hearty meal.   Try 24. Try often. Best Doppelbock class.

Smells of warmed toffee, together with dried plums, a smoky whiff and walnut shell. On top of this foundation settles earth coated liquorice, molasses and balancing whole grain bread.     Has a velvet mouthfeel to it, with a medium carbonation and a silk, malt defined smoothness throughout.     Tastes of burned toffee, molasses and caramel, outstandingly well balanced by bitter, dry earth. Its bitterness reveals coffee dregs among an herbal, leafy dryness. Adds a soft dried fruit quality to the flavors, with rock sugar creating a short, sweet peak after the swallow. Nontheless, its world class mouthfeel maintains, due to an aqueous quality soothing the sweetness, creating a transition for the well nuanced bitterness, slowly developing from its earthy foundation. This enables a clean finish, with a brief, toffee coated finish.     Quite complex and pleasantly challenging, as the beer denies the palate to drown solely in sugary malts. Instead, it features a great grassiness of matured hops and bready earth, all mellowed by a world class mouthfeel, ensuring an utmost clean finish.

Nose is big malt and dark ripe fruit - currants and raisins. But a little light and otherwise not overly distinct.    Flavor is rich, malt sweetness with a great depth of dried and ripe fruits. Great bitter comes at the end. Fantastic, quintessential doppelbock. Fantastic.    Feel is light and airy with this level of carbonation. Wonderful mouthfeel, dry and lightly bitter finish where there hops really come through.    This has been a longtime favorite beer but the first time I've reviewed it - haven't had it in years but it always holds up to my memories of a fantastic beer.

Looks very dark brown, almost black, in the glass, and an aggressive pour yields an enormous fluffy tan head that leaves behind splotchy lacing. It's a thing of beauty.  The smell is pure toasted malts. Nutty, bready, toasty, and sweet. Caramel, brown sugar, earth, and spices.  On the palate, you get pure toasted malts upfront. Brown sugar, caramel, molasses, and licorice. Thick chunks of toasted brown bread. Dark fruits. Cherries, figs, and raisins. A touch of cocoa. Spiciness of clove and a hint of vanilla. There's some lingering sweetness but there's a beet-like earthiness that balances it.  The mouthfeel is medium-approaching heavy with a nice light carbonation that makes it very drinkable.    This is an excellent beer worthy of its reputation. As a hophead, this is one of the best malt-forward beers I've had.

The appearance was a dark brown color with a thick creamy to white colored three finger-ed head.As it dissipates, lacing becomes foamy and stringy.  The smell has some raisins, dark bread, chocolate, estery dark fruits, light brown sugar, toffee, and a little bit of caramel all running in for the blend.  The taste was mainly malty sweet bringing in the fruits for extra sweetness. There's a light lingering malty sweet aftertaste leading into a sly malty finish.  The mouthfeel was about a light to medium in body with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation runs nice and light. Malty smoothness glides over my tongue nicely.  Overall, not just the standard of doppelbocks but a world class beer for this time of year. Would I have another? Damn right I would.

Dark brown-amber colour with a good steady head of foam. Full nose of caramel, liquorice and malt. Very dense taste as well; in fact, the density almost feels like this beer has a fat percentage: roasted malt, caramel, berries and hops. Very thick, very smooth. Get it while you can: it is worth it!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 I thought I knew what good beer was...but that was until today. I have to hand it to the Germans, this was one damn good beer.     Full disclosure - I am a dark beer, stout, porter, dopplebock kinda guy - so I am partial to these types of beers. I have had plenty of them and thought I knew what a good instance of one would be. Boy, was I wrong. This Ayinger Celebrator was an experience unlike any other. Served in a goblet, it had a black but still appealing hue of darkness, a decent head, but little staying power (admittedly something I easily overlooked). The smell was not necessarily anything that was memorable, but it didn't have any of the other "heavy" odors of dark beers. The feel was truly smooth, silky, and easy to be sessionable. But what simply blew me away was the taste - by God - I can't say enough about it. It was unlike any other dopplebock I have had. If given the chance I would probably drink this stuff for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (but I suppose it's a good thing I don't.) Overall, it was by far the best beer I've had in a very long time, if not the best ever.    UPDATE: 12 August 2016   This is still the best damned beer I have had to date. And now, after having as many as I have had, I can tell you there is a hint of honey to the brew. So not only delicious, but a hint of sweetness to it. Damn, the Germans really know how to make beer.

The appearance was a moderately hazy mostly dark brown color with a nice looking almond color-ed two and a half finger-ed head. Lacing speckled nice and thick in the wake of the head.  The smell started off with some sweet caramel malts, a light dose of nuts, some dark fruits, molasses, cocoa.  The taste copied the smell pretty much spot on with a sweet bready aftertaste and finish.  The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a smooth creaminess laying down on my tongue.  Overall, really liked this one for what it is, gonna have to go back and get more to sip through the Winter.

The malty taste comes through with almost a fresh chocolate malt flavor with just enough alcohol and bitterness to balance the flavor. Well balanced doppelbock. ....love the label as well.

TASTE: OH BEHAVE.... malty, caramelly, toast, throw in some hints of chocholate and a bitter light sweetness and your there...    PALATE: With a medium body and medium/light carbonation. It's full on the palate and full of flavor. the flavor lasts a very long time. It goes down very smooth.    OVERALL: This is a great doppelboch! It is the bench mark for all others to be judged...

No doubt a world class doppelbock.

You get a good malty and toasty smell you also get a sweet, cocoa, and citrus smell after you taste it. The taste is great. it has little to no alcohol presence and has a great malty, creamy, toasty taste that is sweet and smooth. One of the best doppelbocks out there if not arguably the best.

I think it would go well with a dessert or comfort food such as mac and cheese. It is robust without being too rich.   Look: poured into a pilsner. Color is a clear, rich chocolatey brown, the color of cola. Ample tan head with fairly nice lacing.   Nose: a nice, comforting nose. It has a yeasty, malty base, with a buttery and burnt caramel overtone. When inhaling deeply, it almost smells like cookie dough.   Taste: A mellow caramel with a woody, earthy base. Pronounced alcohol aftertaste.   Feel: A moderate amount of carbonation. Pretty creamy.

This beer seems to sit on the shelves so I wasn't expecting much from this beer. I was wrong. This beer poured dark brown with a khaki head. Smelled of bread, malts, slight chocolate, and faint hops. Taste is where this really got interesting. The hops were faint if at all noticeable. I got bread, raisins, dark fruits, bread, malts, and slight chocolate. The taste was very intriguing and very enjoyable. The complexity on the taste really impressed me. The carbonation was just right to make this very very smooth. I did not pick up any alcohol. I am really impressed by this heavy beer and it is downright almost chewy. I have always been a stout fan and this truly impressed me. This will be a staple in my fridge.

Also slightly see-through, with a ruby red color that gleams in the light. Nice frothy head that was tamed down during the drink.  S: Bready and sweet. Light hints of chocolate, bigger notes of fruits such as raisins, figs, and plums. Maybe a little molasses.  T: Similar to the smell, very sweet, molasses, raisins, figs and plums really coming to mind. LIttle to no hoppiness really. A slight toasty malt flavor not all that different from a great German pilsener on the finish.  F: Damn smooth. Like a silk dress on a pretty woman smooth, no joke. Mouthfeel is just great.   O: Have had this beer many times, but after trying many more throughout my time I thought it was wise to come back and experience/rate what I consider to be the pinnacle of this style. All subjectivity aside, this really is a great beer that exists at a happy medium between the great flavor of a porter but with the smooth drinkability of a lager. However it does not comprimise on flavor.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I have seen this around in bottles, but when I saw it available on tap at Craft, I jumped at the opportunity to try this.  Deep, dark reddish brown, short but thick tan head. Foam dissipates slowly, thick coating of lace.  The smell has lots going on, dark sweet malts, a bit of smoke or light char, some fruitiness as well, prune and plum. Touch of alcohol, that also comes out on the palate.  Flavor is rich and full, dark plum fruit, sweet malts, hint of smokiness, then just at the end some hop bitterness comes through. A bit nutty, maybe even chocolate flavors develope as it begins to warm. Not overly bitter, but just enough to keep everything else in balance.  Very complex, but still smooth and drinkable. Lots of deep flavor, almost like a quad, but still light and refreshing so you don't feel tooo full.  Worthy of its "World-Class" rank.    Note to self: Ranked #1 Doppelbock when I tried it.  #104 of Top 250 Beers.  #21 on the Beers of Fame.  #2 Top Rated Beers of Germany.

Smelled of dark malts and maybe some dark fruit. Tasted immediately upon pouring and got an unpleasant metallic taste, so I let it warm up.    After warmup time, I got burnt toast and grains, and a hint of brandied cherries. Very tasty. My only complaints are that as doppelbock this has to warm, and that I only had 12 oz, not a pint. Will definitely be buying again.

A style far too often overlooked, but this doppelbock is nothing short of perfection. I have deep, German roots and love the fact that this come from the Motherland!    Drink up, BA's. This is one beer everyone should try. Malty, sweet, strong and beautiful- it's available almost everywhere as well, so leave your harpoon at home, whale-hunters!

An opaque brew (seemingly black) with vinous red highlights around the base of the snifter in the light. Rich and malty on the nose, opens up to some nice dark fruits (plums, raisins) and hints of tobacco and light chocolate notes. Nice, but really had to work on the 'smell' portion here. Just a hint of tartness up front on this one, moving into the dark fruits which came in as some nice cherries on the mid, and alcohol warming noticeable. Aftertaste actually brings up more of the malty and chocolatey notes sneaking in. Nice coating mouthfeel and creamy carbonation. Drinks like a bigger ABV beer. Comes together well, and now I have a benchmark doppelbock.

S - Caramel, biscuits, light stone fruit aroma.    T - Bright, lightly toasty malts hit right off the bat, with notes of biscuits, butter, and caramel. Fruity esters from the yeast produce bananalike, plumlike flavors underneath, but the sweet malts steal the show. Very light hop bitterness adds a certain crispness to the flavor. Nice residual sweetness.     M - Medium-heavy body, light carbonation. Very little dryness.    O - Everything you could ask for in a Doppelbock and more. A straightforward but oh-so hearty brew.

The way it looks very much promises the dark, rich, chewy brew to ahead of you.    S: Pumpernickel bread, toffee, prunes and raisins, wet coffee grounds    T: Toasted wheat bread, graham cracker, molasses, prunes, wet coffee grounds. Finish is like burnt sugar, dark sweetness that leads to lingering bitterness. Super elegant and complex for so much malt.    M: Light to medium carbonation, really decent chew to it. Not imperial stout chewy, but definitely full bodied for the style.     O: I think it lives up to the hype. Back of the bottle says "DARK, MALTY, AND RICH" and that's exactly what you get. But more. This is like a loaf of bread at an artisinal bakery or chocolate cake from a high end pastry shop. Maybe you can buy bread and cake at the grocery store, but it's not going to create a rich, flavorful, and cohesive landscape for your tastebuds like the others can. I found the new standard by which I will now compare all other doppelbocks to.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a 12oz bottle.    Big head, about a full inch -- cafe-o-lait color. Very dark body that's opaque until held to the light, then translucent maroon. Nice looking!    The smell has a lot of true malt coming through, almost like malt candy, chocolate, some present alcohol.    Very full flavor, not as sweet as I expected. Very 'roasty'. There's a metallic undertone that reminds me of traditional molasses. Surprisingly smooth and easy to drink. Just a bit smokey. Some cereal coming through. The alcohol is present in the flavor as well, that brings some warmth.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 As a fan of doppelbocks, I did like this. I know many consider it the standard by which all doppel's are judged, but I prefer Salvator a tad more. Very intense sustained sweetness to this one, which sort of hands off almost entirely to a fair bitterness at the finish and beyond. For me personally, I think Salvator may "balance/blend" those spectrums a tad more effectively so it's not so pronounced. Nice head and darker color to this: more brown than copper or orange. A little lacing, but not a great amount. Fairly thick mouthfeel and decent carbonation. This one more similar to Eggenberg's doppelbock to me.

Grapey dark fruit, caramel, brown sugar. Very rich and sweet. Some brighter fruity esters as well. Toasted bread. No hop aroma. A hint of oxidation, but not bad.    Dark fruits and roasted malts. Big and rich, but not sweet. A hint of cocoa. No hop character and low bitterness. Very bready. Impressively clean lager fermentation. The malt shines beautifully. Some mineral notes as well.    Full body with medium low carbonation. Smooth and dry finish with lingering roastiness on the palate.    Big and rich without being sweet. A classic, of course.

This is hands down my favorite doppelbock. Definitely worth starting a collection of little white plastic goats.

Feel: full bodied, chewy, voluptuous, lusty, viscous liquid. Great sweet aftertaste, and I bet my mouth smelled better than any gum out there.     One of the best beers I have ever had, and I'll keep coming back for more. Also, great label, and thanks for plastic mountain goat!
