look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours black with two fingers of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is milk chocolate, cocoa nibs, and roasty, toasty, earthy, nutty malts. It carries a light bitterness to the aroma, but it fades away as the beer warms a touch. Flavor profile is milk chocolate, cocoa nibs and caramel layered over roasty, toasty, earthy, nutty, caramely malts. It carries a distinct and notable bitterness, with the chocolate working to sooth that a touch. It becomes more balanced as the beer warms. Mouth feel is lightly creamy, with a medium-thin consistency. At warmer temperatures, the consistency thins out a touch with a more still texture as opposed to creamy. Overall, chocolate notes are pleasant with a light-bodied dark beer underneath.    Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 16.9oz bottle.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 It's dark with a creamy brown head that dissipates quickly.     Smell was slightly metallic with a hint of coffee.

It was thin, but easy to drink and pleasant.     Overall I don't think I'd get this beer again. The metallic taste was too much for me and I was disappointed with the lack of chocolate flavor.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Before I knew much about craft beer, I was already drinking Young's Double Chocolate Stout. I loved the texture and the taste - I couldn't exactly crush these (still can't), but I sure tried. Sweet, thick, rich, and still a memorable beer, even after years of ticking. Highly recommended for the style - it's a fantastic representative.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very, very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque black in the glass with a one finger, ultra fine, light brown head with great retention and nice lacing. This was a can with a widget inside and the head is an excellent simulation of a nitro pour. Aroma of dark toasted and biscuit malt, milk chocolate; a hint of vanilla and coffee. Flavor follows, with slightly sweet, dark toasted malt, milk chocolate, a little vanilla and more roast and a slight coffee component in the finish. Luxuriously creamy medium body with great mouth feel. One of the classic chocolate stouts and deservedly so. A little lighter in flavor than I expected, but everything is mellow and well integrated. The chocolate is authentic tasting, but somewhat understated and the finish is a little drier than the initial taste. The creamy body enhances the balanced flavors and I would buy this widget can over any other format for that reason. Very pleasant and satisfying. Another beer that I've had many, many times, but never reviewed for some reason.

S - This is where the bulk of the chocolate hides, on the nose, especially when still chilled. Heavenly  T - As it warms, those aromas of chocolate turn more oyster stout-like, and it does occasionally...  F - lose a little CO2 carbonation as it warms, and seems watery by the end of the near-pint serving but still delicate.  O - One of the classics, even if it is often overshadowed by other "showy" higher alcohol stouts these days.

The finish has a some small bitterness, while still having a good amount of the roasted malts and the chocolate in the flavour.I sense is a little bit watery in the finish. The aftertaste has a good lenght with a good feel. Mouthfeel is silky and smooth with a moderate carbonation.Goes down very easy.   A delicious stout. Great flavour. Enjoyed it a lot.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Five bucks for a bottle over at H-E-B. A little on the expensive side, but I think this one is meant for the occasional treat rather than having every day.    Look, smell, and taste are all exactly what you'd expect. Dark, creamy, and chocolatey. Like a lot of other dark flavored beers, I pick up some coffee notes here and there too. Pairs extremely well with a chocolate muffin. I can imagine you might pack on the pounds if you drink this too often, so use sparingly! Overall, an excellent stout with a strong flavor that doesn't taste artificial.

This does taste like some form of luxurious liquid. I am picking up on the dark chocolate sweetness, some roasted malts, slight caramel. The mouthfeel is quite thin but most nitrogen beers usually are that way. I recommend you drink this beer fresh, no later than say 4 or 5 months in the can for the best taste. Cheers! A-

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a 330ml bottle into glass. Stamped on bottle neck is best by date of '20/02/18'.  Dark brown body with brown highlights when presented to light. Bubbly two finger light tan colored head settles to bubbly cap. Good area coverage of spotty lacing.  There is a dark fruit component to both the aroma and the taste, which is quite comparable in expression to the different senses. Aroma also has dark malts and chocolate.  Taste expresses a solid dark malt base, and lighter additions of chocolate and coffee. Sweetness on the light side.  Thin to medium mouth feel. Very easy drinking. Not exactly dry but quick to clear the palate.  Solid stout with chocolate that can be paired with many foods. Clean, and induces repeated sips.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Decided to revisit this one after several years, and it's much better than I remember. A rather aggressive pour into a nonic pint glass yielded a ton of thick, soapy tan foam atop an almost ebony-colored body. Scads of sticky lacing as the head settled into a thick cap. This has a very nice roasty malt character, with lots of chocolate flavor as expected. There are also notes of tart fruit and dark roast coffee coming through as the beer warms toward room temperature. Medium light in body, not too sweet. Surprisingly dry finish, with a little lingering roasted coffee-bean bitterness. This is light enough, dry enough, and low enough in ABV to make it a great pairing with all kinds of food. Not overpowering, very drinkable. Although a little on the spendy side, it's worth an occasional splurge. Widely available in the U.S.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours a dark brown color with a beige head that is slow to dissipate. Smell is roasted malts, dark breads, and a hint of chocolate. Taste is chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and a little bit of hop bitterness that keeps it from being too sweet. Medium weight with some active carbonation. It's a pleasant stout, tasty, and not too heavy.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottle BB 1/24/18. CBF pint.    A: pours an opaque black with one finger sandy head that fades to spotty islands of bubbles. Great drapes of lacing.    S: honestly, I expected more chocolate. Sam Smith's chocolate stout was overpoweringly chocolatey; this is not. That's not to say there is no chocolate here; there is - but it is subtle. This is also an old bottle. Chocolate smell is, of course, more pronounced as it warms. An almost almond-like note comes with it, and some coffee. Imagine a dark roast with a shot of almond syrup, black. Amaretto.    T: arrives malty, ever so barely sweet, slightly sour. Mid palate is roast and some floral English hop, turning slightly sour. Sweeter than Bell's Kalamazoo stout, less so than Left Hand.    M: lighter end of midweight, active but not overwhelming carbonation. Slick, but lighter weight and low ABV keep it drinkable.    O:This is a classic English stout par excellance. I like this better than SS chocolate, and about as much as SS Oatmeal stout. Very similar, in fact, to that oatmeal stout. Earned a place in my regular rotation.

Smells mildly sweet, like raisins. Tastes like raisins, mild molasses maybe, touch of cocoa, mixed with a roasted/toasted mix, but far from too sweet like most stouts I've had. I've been looking for a stout that's not too sweet. This is a solid and great beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a clear pint glass. Black and faintly brown color with a dark tan foamy head.     The most obvious smell is roasted coffee beans and other toasted malts, alongside with the chocolate/cocoa scents to the brew. There's a hint of vanilla in there too. All of it smells very rich and sweet, the flavors dancing in the scent.    The taste has a prominent chocolate flavor, most notably milk chocolate however it's not overly sweet. Vanilla also is another key flavor. Others include cream, a staunch coffee presence, and slightly bitter hops. The myriad of different sweet flavors balance with the hops. Feels smooth and creamy going down.

Appearance: Very dark black with a very thick tan/brown head. Head is thicker and creamier than many other stouts, and left a good amount of lacing on the glass.    Smell: Balanced aroma of roasted coffee, toasted malts, caramel, chocolate, and cocoa as well, but overall the roasted malts dominate the others. I do not get much hops aroma.     Taste: Strong chocolate flavor. There is an interesting balance between the coffee, roasted malts, chocolate, and some bitterness from hops. The chocolate makes it sweet, but there is bitterness enhancing the taste and adding some complexity. There is a medium alcohol presence.    Mouth-feel: Medium alcohol, but with a very smooth and creamy body.    This is a nice, complex stout, and it has a variety of flavors that adds a nice complexity to the beer. Although this is a medium-bodied stout, it is very smooth and enjoyable to drink.

It's a refreshing "dessert" beer to me with it's heavy chocolate taste of course but also lighter vanilla and coffee tones that we've come to expect from a lot of stouts and porters.   It pours like a beaut, nice rich black color and a light tan head make ya wanna oggle more than drink.   Definitely getting this one again

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 A classic sweet Stout that really is quite unique.    Has the whole Guiness widget pour from a can method. Once settled have less than and inch of thich dark cream head with an opague brown/black body.    Smells of malt, milk chocolate, and some vanilla and a touch of dates.    Taste improves as it warms. First notes are strong vanilla, chocolate with balanced malt with a touch of alcohol and a slight hint of coffee in the finish.    Body is lighter than expected, but very refreshing, this would be a meal of its own with some more body, but as is would compliment a vanilla or.chocolate desert amazingly.

Since I'm one of those who says beer does not get better with age, I don't expect much ...    Surprise, surprise this little stout has held up remarkably well, though I have no idea what it tastes like fresh. Chocolate milk stout smooth creamy delicious. Classic for good reason, obviously.

L: appears almost pitch black once settled with 1/2 inch beige head that stays the whole way.  S: chocolate hits the nose first and more chocolate with slight hints of malt and a touch of fruit.  T: wonderful chocolate and lots of it with roasted malt flavor. Love it!   F: it is a bit thinner than I would have expected but it still goes down smooth.  O: overall I see why this beer gets high ratings and I really enjoyed my experience and probably will buy more in future I only wish it had a bit more body but can for sure see why this is a classic!

F: The sweet chocolate plays well against the roasted flavors. Creamy and smooth.  O: Very satisfying brew. Very glad this is in a regular rotation at the local LCBO.

Pours a pitch black color with a nice thumb and a half of root beer head. Retention is excellent and there is some fantastic lacing. The smell is sweet fudgy chocolate, malty goodness and some vanilla. The taste follows the nose fairly closely with the chocolate being dominant. Feel is much thinner than expected, not a bad thing just not expected, and the carbonation is fine.    A good sweet stout. Would pair nice with some cookies or a plain donut at dessert. A classic, and now I understand why.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Poured into a nonic pint glass, the appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a quickly dissipating finger's worth of off white foamy head. Not much lace.  The aroma had a ton of smooth sweet fudge-like milk chocolate tones.  The flavor was the same with a semi-syrupy aftertaste of that chocolate.  The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with what I hate to say but a "watery" sort of finish. Carbonation did feel fine. ABV felt just as good.  Overall, the classic English styled "milk/sweet stout" where that watery finish is the norm. With that in mind, I can't be too harsh in my numbers.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 A solid but not overly heavy stout. Dark, pours clean with a moderate head and good aroma. I was afraid it might be too sweet or too chocolaty but it was an overall excellent offering. Making this a regular purchase.

Taste - Sugary sweet up front, tastes similar to chocolate syrup, not a whole lot of roasted malt, a bit of caramel towards the end. The aftertaste is slightly sour, sugary and a little metallic. More chocolate than stout characteristics.  Feel - Light-Medium bodied, ample carbonation, a bit watery.    Overall - Easy drinking. Hard to tell that this is a stout, but worth a try if you love chocolate.

I've noticed a lot of people talking about a nitro head and so on, but as far as I've ever tried this beer, it's been carbonated, the regular way. With carbon dioxide.    I've picked up a bottle of this for plenty of "me" times, because it's a great comfort beer. It's one of those fabled "you can drink it a little colder than room temperature" beers from England that we've all heard so much about. In fact, you really don't want it too cold, because the flavors are so varied and delicious.     Pouring this properly leads to a relatively weak head, especially for a relatively fizzy British beer, but you won't mind too much once you've had a few sips. The first whiff gives an almost woody inhale with a deceptively sweet finish, but the first quaff dispels the saccharine-sweet notion, replaced by a very-lightly sweetened, almost natural-tasting coffee flavor. This makes sense as cocoa and coffee aren't all that far off in terms of raw taste, with both being fairly bitter, robust pods originally drunk by dipping grindings with hot water. Both also contain caffeine, of course.    Others I've seen have compared this to Guinness. Why, I can only imagine. I'm guessing they may only have ever tried the Irish staple before and have no other stouts to compare this British great to. Perhaps in England this is served with a similar nitrogen bubble, but in the U.S., it seems to always be properly carbonated. It is a little flat compared to macro lagers, but against your standard pretentious microbrew, this is fairly carbonated. It's no soda, but it's definitely not a nearly-flat Guinness.     The mouthfeel, aside from the carbonation, is quite thick and creamy. It earns the term "milk stout". I remember as a younger man, hearing people often saying that Guinness is a meal in a can, but this stout is a 4-course royalty dinner in a bottle. You're not so much drinking as chewing this beer, which is actually rather enjoyable in this case.     Someday, when I don't feel like I'm wasting my money, I want to try this as a float. With Ice Cream. Until then, I'll continue to save up and buy a bottle when I get a chance. I suggest you do the same if you're looking for something tasty, different, and impressive. Dark as hell, thick, delicious, and still quite small. It's worth the ~5 dollars.

Taste is coffee first, then chocolate milk. Slightly peppery. Roasty/toasted bread. Slight bitterness in the aftertaste. Very "round" taste, feels rich without being too heavy.    Smooth mouthfeel, medium carbonation and body.    Pretty good, well-balanced. Needs more bite.

Nose: bitter chocolate, toffee, banana; palate: remarkably dry with nice balance of dark roasted malts and dark chocolate, with anise notes. Medium bodied with full, creamy mouthfeel. Really a impressive drinking experience.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3.25 I poured this one out of a can with the widget so I got that cool upside down head that finally settles out to a very dark black with a nice creamy, frothy, two fingers of a tan head. The beer was black enough that I could not see any ruby notes around the base of my tulip glass.    The smell was pretty basic with some bitter chocolate, like bakers chocolate, and some hints of coffee.    The taste was much like the nose with that bitter chocolate and some coffee. The chocolate was sweetened somewhat by the lactose and nitro that made it just a bit sweeter than straight bakers chocolate.    Mouth feel was a medium creaminess with a wet finish. And also note because of that nitro the beer, in my opinion, tastes flat and blah.    I did not realize I was getting nitro cans and was dissapointed when I went to get the beer out of the fridge and heard that widget rattling around in the can. Sorry to all the folks that like them I just think that nitro kills the beer. Give me carbonation over that flat nitro flavor any day of the week. At least the wife enjoyed it a lot more as she actually likes the nitro. So there you go, two opposing views of the same beer.

Big chocolate note mid-late palate with some additional sweetness. Probably that caramel coming through again. Overall no real issues with the beer and would drink again.

T- The most velvety chocolate on first sip accompanied by espresso, caramel, toasted nuts, and cream.

Taste is just some medium roasted malt and some milk chocolate. Understated, maybe to a fault as none of the flavors really assert themselves. That said, there is nothing off about it and it checks all the boxes, Could have been creamier on the feel.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Black, a little ruby edge up to the light, and a lasting tan head with good lacing down the glass. Nose is big Tootsie Rolls. The flavor is a little cola-like at first, then big chocolate kicks in mid-palate. A nice subtle bitterness takes over from there and you get a nice combo of bitter and sweet chocolate. Slightly creamy and oily, dry on the finish, average carbonation, and medium thin body. Overall, it reminds me a bit of Boulder's Shake Chocolate Porter, with that big Tootsie roll vibe. Nice stuff.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 2 | overall: 3.25 440 mL nitro can into globe     A: An aggressive pour yields a bodacious one and a half finger cream head with some light cascading. 100% opaque, deep granite. Very strong retention (impressive).     S: Light, creamy, mellow roasted malts. Has a particular dairy character, reminiscent of a milk stout? Undertones of caramel, traces of date following with notes of hazelnut. Prevalent coco essence blended with mulled raisins.     T: Does not betray the nose, sweet, almost as a coffee creamer. Repressed nuttiness, but teaming with malt character. A lot of milk chocolate play, with a certain level of pruininess. Not something I would call complex, and lacking a desired roasted facet. A little too much of a diacetyl profile. Finish is overly confectious, and overwhelmed by a lactic presence.     M: Way too light in my opinion, even if this was classified as a milk stout. Almost watery. The body is good, thanks to the nitro, light, frappe, easy drinking.     O: Not a favorite. There isn’t much else to say. Look to Left Hand.

Taste - Bitter-sweet chocolate tied with maltiness, a tiny bit of sweetness, a fair amount of dryness.    Feel - Perfect carbonation level IMO. Feel is medium thickness, tingly and dry.    Overall - Pretty OK chocolate stout, nothing too special about it to separate it from other chocolate stouts. I prefer chocolate stouts to be sweet, and this one doesn't have that level of sweetness I look for. But if you prefer dryer, less sweet stouts, then more power to ya and this is definitely something you might like.

Now that is out of the way, lets talk about the aroma, no the head, good 3/4" tan small bubbled head. An aroma evocative of chocolate malt for sure. A little bit of barley behind that.    Taste, wow, the lactose in this and chocolate malt make for a very chocolate forward beer without the use of any actual chocolate. Right? This doesn't actually have the adjunct chocolate? Its chocolate malt and lactose, and they work well. You never have the roasty edge in this one, that's why I said oily and stuff. Pretty sessionable. I think this is a good stout to give people who don't like the overly bitter and heavily roasty or syrupy ones.

Meaning, I will drink one of these in rotation with Murphy's to keep it from getting too familiar to where I can't appreciate the flavors. I'm not trying to get an experience from my stout. It just has to work and taste good enough. I can appreciate where Young's is going with this version. It's a relatively good, all purpose stout. It's really good at knocking the dust off on hot summer days and it's great with dinner.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 4.25 Serving type: 12 oz bottle into a pint glass    Pours a deep mahogany brown color with mocha colored bubbles that persist. Smell is of chocolate syrup, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, slight mocha roastiness. Taste reflects the smell. Initial chocolate and dark chocolate flavors lead into a pleasant roastiness that finishes with a cocoa powder flavor that lingers for a short while. Feel is a bit thin, carbonated fine. A little weak for the stronger chocolate and roasty flavors. Overall this is a great dessert beer with outstanding chocolate and roast qualities but the feel is a bit underwhelming.

Undertones of roasted malt and lactose. The aromas are not as robust as I'd like to see.     Taste followed the nose with a ton of chocolate flavor up front, both milk chocolate and powered cocoa. A balanced backbone of roasted malts, mild hoppy bitterness and sweet lactose are also present.     Feel was thick and velvety with some mild carbonation.     Overall a really fine example of a chocolate milk stout. One of the better ones out there.

Reminds me of a Guiness draft, but I liked it better. Albeit, I'm not that big of a fan of Guiness.

look: 4.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Great UK stout roughly in the style of the classic standard-bearer, Guinness. Perfectly black with a dense nitro head that lasts forever and laces the glass all the way to the last sip. Subtle smell with undertones of chocolate and coffee. Not much more intense than a Guinness, but with a lot more complexity: in addition to the dark roast of the malt, there's abundant chocolate and coffee going on here too. A great session stout

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Young’s Double Chocolate Stout Brewed by Wells & Young's Ltd with an ABV of 5.20% This Stout pours out a deep brown color with a nice off white head. The head on this stout is nice and thick. This brew puts you in the mind set of cola , not saying that is a bad thing. The smell of Young’s Double Chocolate Stout is rich with roasted grains , malts and hops. There is also a nice amount of sweetness in the smell of this brew. More than likely from the chocolate. Now for the taste it is bold with flavors. You first pick up the smoothness of roasted grains ,malts. Then there is a nice sweetness smoothness at the end of this brew. There is alot going on in Young's Double Chocolate Stout. This brew has a real super nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. I can't get over how smooth this brew is. The mouthfeel of Young's Double Chocolate Stout, is rich, bold, clean, and smooth. This is one of the better Milk /Sweet Stout on the market. I really like this brew. Overall I'm giving Young's Double Chocolate Stout a 4.75 out of 5. I would buy this brew again. Wells & Young's Ltd, did an great job with this one. Thank You

Poured from a nitro can into a stout glass, this beer's head is two fingers thick, with solid lacing, and a cola-esque body.    I smell masterfully roasted malts alongside the pleasant addition of the chocolates used in the brewing process of this particular offering.    Tastes like a nice blend of the notes of the smell with a nice touch of coffee in there as well. Nice and easy-going and crush-ability.    The mouthfeel here is very light as it is a nitro-canned version. Smooth and clean.    Overall, I'll give Young's Double Chocolate Stout | Wells & Young's Ltd a well-deserved 4.5. The most tolerable nitro stout I've had thus far with a very pleasing taste.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 500ml bottle given to me by a supplier.    Poured an amazing dark chocolate brown with ab hint of... red/purple. Was quite surprised by the colour and forced a 'fuck me' out of me. Big off-white/beige head which lasted and left some lacing.    Nose is good. Lots of toasted aroma, chocolate, coffee, toffee and caramel.    Palate is lovely with coffee, chcoclate and toffe and a balanced bitter finish with some toastiness/burnt flavour. Thankful for the burnt flavours not being to prevelant as I'm not a fan.    Mouth is surprisingly thin and I was disappointed by it.    Overall a breat beer. Big, bold flavours, well balanced and looks great. Shame about the mouth feel.    Highly recommended.

In the taste, there is a milky chocolate sweetness that coats the mouth, however, in the mouthfeel there is a slightly bitter taste that is espresso like and slightly hoppy. Very smooth and mellow. The body is lighter for a stout, thus making it easy to drink and session able. A nice beer to pair with dessert. I gave it 4s all around.

A flash of chocolate, coffee, and lactose up front, and a quick, biscuity finish. Not much "fuller" than Guinness unfortunately, but a solid dessert beer nonetheless.

L: Pour gives you 2+ finger very light tan head, very strong retention, lacing, ring. Beer is very dark.    S: Roasted coffee, roasted malts, unsweetened cocoa. All weakish.    T: Follows nose with creamy dairy addition per its style. Weakish and watery. For something labelled double chocolate, you really don't get a whole lot of it.    F: Light to medium bodied (too light). Watered down taste. Low ABV gives watery finish, though moderate carbonation (too high) tries to help with that. Definitely not what you like in a stout.    O: So I tried it and now I don't have to do so again.

I had this at a local pub about 5 months back and thought it deserved a second go round. Into a tulip it goes..Looks like a stout, not a long lasting retained head, but a tightly held together lacing that cascaded down slowly. This time first smell was chocolate mudslide with whipped cream. First taste was as it smelled..with a side of smoky roasted malts. Kinda reminded me of a hazelnut coffee blend I drink. For it smelling and tasting, to me, like a mudslide, the feel was the opposite, very thin for what I'd expect. That was the only let down. Not by far my favorite stout, but as this is a sweet stout I thought it was ok.

Not overly strong but you know its there.  I would like to taste the diff between this can and a bottle. Not bad. Glad I gave it a shot.

Smells mostly of vanilla and cocoa with some light hops. The taste follows closely with vanilla, cocoa, hops, roasted malt, and faint lactose sweetness. Thin body and above average carbonation. Overall, it's a easy to find stout, but it needs a lot more flavor, body, lactose, and complexity. There are better Milk Stouts on the shelf.

Also contains hints of roasted coffee beans, and vanilla.     Feel: Heavy, creamy, medium carbonation.     This beer can be likened to taking a bite of high quality dark chocolate. It has heavy notes of bitter dark chocolate, and is creamy in character which works well with the style. Despite the creaminess, this beer retains a relatively high carbonation. Highly recommend this one to sweet stout lovers.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 500ml bottle poured into a pint glass.    Look:  Very dark brown to almost black in color, the pour forms massive frothy tan head that everlasting stands until the last sip. It just slowly subsides to thick foamy layer covering atop while leaves plenty of refined lacings along the way down. Active carbonation can be obviously seen through its dark body.    Smell:  The aromas consist of very rich chocolate, coffee, somewhat milky and creamy, vanilla, burnt sugar and a hint of licorice.    Taste:  Big and rich chocolate in mouth, chewy and creamy sweet but not too overwhelm, roasted character mingles to balance along with some bitterness from hop. Complexity is added by a note of coffee and vanilla. The aftertaste is long lasting chocolate flavor, really tasty one.    Feel:  Rather full body with super smooth mouthfeel, the carbonation is low to medium which is properly fit and carries all the things well. Finish is a bit dry.    Overall:  This beer deserves a try. It holds all the qualities of that great Stouts could have. Perfect pairing with chocolate.

I"m almost converting to a stout drinker rather than an IPA drinker.  There was so much going on that I'd never experienced in a beer before.  2 thumbs up!    Look: Black, like your ex girlfriend heart.   Just kidding, she doesn't have a heart, do you... Elaine?!! but, I digress.    Very nice off white creamy head that stayed constant the whole time I was drinking from my grandfathers handle mug he won by winning a lawn bowls competition.    Smell: Ahhh, The fine bouquet of chocolate malt. Not too strong yet strong enough with just a hint of cocoa.    Taste. Once again that chocolate malt comes through, not overpowering and not cloying like some stouts can be. Rich and yet subtly sweet and smooth. I could drink it all day and night through winter.    Feel: creamy, very creamy. Almost like drinking the flavored topping you put on your ice cream. Not as thick of course. It has that hard feel to it though. Exactly what you'd expect from a good stout claiming to be a good stout.    OA: As I stated; this was my first chocolate stout.  I found it very easy to drink, something even non-initiated stout drinkers could enjoy.  The roasting is pleasant and not like your drinking a camp fire (which I don't mind at all) followed by the perfectly balanced sweetness of 80% pure cocoa.  Great mouth feel and a pleasure to watch the lacing as it creates a terraced garden effect down the side of the glass after each swallow.

It coats the entire palate with rich chocolate and coffee flavors with a touch of bitter on the finish.    F: Very rich and full feel.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Pours black as night with a one finger tan head that lingers and leaves a ring of lacing at the top of the glass. Aroma of lightly roasted coffee and genuine dark chocolate. Taste is semisweet chocolate, dark chocolate, and roasted coffee with a barely bitter malt finish. Creamy medium body with light carbonation. It doesn't feel sticky or have an artificial taste feel.  It's a creamy, drinkable chocolate stout that isn't artificially or chemically enhanced. It's been around a while, so I assumed it'd be good or be living off reputation. It's good and was a very nice dessert beer.

I rated the look slightly lower because I think the labeling could be more intricate, but the color and the richness of the flavor does match the typography. I drank this in the bottle because I often drink dark beers in the bottle. I drink this beer because I'm breastfeeding, and stouts are known to up milk production. the flavor and smell had a rich and chocolatey-espresso taste just as I expected, not too sweet or carbonated. it was an artificial but it was still pretty decent for my liking, although that's simply a matter of preference. I'll probably drink this beer again.

look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 1.5 | feel: 2 | overall: 1.5 I got the nitro cans, as some others did, and it must be emphasized- in fact it can not be emphasized enough- that it was a terrible experience. This stout did not live well in a can, and did not retain carbonation or head even in spite of the nitro. Went completely, and I mean COMPLETELY flat in seconds. I've had stouts that were not marketed as chocolate, which had more flavor of chocolate, and it was so tart that I couldn't help wondering how they even called this a stout. I've had lemon shandies that weren't this acidic. I might try from a bottle later, but based on my experience with the can, it would have to be almost an entirely different beer, to pay import prices. Unless you're living in the UK, where this cheap, or have some kind of youthful nostalgia, it is not remotely worth the (roughly) $15 the six bottles will cost you in the US.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 I had it from the bottle. It is a great stout. I'm my opinion stouts are just better in nitro, but this one holds it's own in CO2. It is not super-mega chocolate tasting, but that (I feel) would be over powering. Clean finish not much after taste.

Lighter than expected. 3.5/5    O - Can't say that I truly enjoyed this one. It was okay. Not bad, not good. Flavors and aroma seemed very muted to me.

Maybe too sweet to be a session beer, but it's too easy going to be anything else.

look: 3 | smell: 1.75 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2 | overall: 3.75 Poured from nitro can. Looks cool, very dark. Nitro heads are about the same, thick small bubbles with lots of carbocations rising from the bottom. Smell is malts with a hint of chocolate. Taste is what I think affected with the nitro ball, probably the last time I get a nitro ball brew unless I hear the taste is otherwise un-affected. Tasted like Guinness draught with nitro in my opinion with a bit of chocolate. Maybe I need to try the same beer but from the bottle. The beer seemed thin and not so rich as most chocolate stouts. Pretty mediocre in comparison to other chocolate stouts I have had.

I can never tell how feel about the head of beers with nitrogen balls. They always have a strange sort of off taste to them that turns me away from it. Looking past that this beer has a pretty solid taste. Very similar to guiness extra stout with a bit more of a chocolate flare. Nothing too special but not a bad beer.

Looked decent in the glass, with a nice head, lacing, and dark brown color. Taste was disappointing to say the least. No sweetness; no chocolate; just a relatively thin non-descript and somewhat bitter dark beer. Looked towards the kitchen sink a couple of times, but did manage to finish. Big let down.

Taste is fairly good too although not as thick as most stouts. Could be more creamy with a more pronounced flavor. Overall good beer but not worth six dollars as pint. Probably won't be buying this again because of the price.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 From a 500mL bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours black as night with foamy brown head that dissipated leaving a ring.   Smell is malty and roasted grain, with sweetness and a tone of dark chocolate.  Moutgfeel: medium carbonation, surprisingly slightly watery.   Taste is malted barley woth a dark roast, a little chocolate, slight astringency. Delicious. Very drinkable, for a stout - I have bought it before and will again.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Appearance: Thin, khaki head that dissipates into a sizable ring of foam. Nice lacing. Blackish body, with hues of brown.    Aroma: Very strong, with emphasis on the upfront notes of sweet grain (it's heavy on the grain), and that sweet, typical malty stout aroma. I detect a minute amount of some kind of chocolate note half-way through the drink, and as it warms. But it remains mostly sweet, grainy, and dark-roasted.     Taste: the taste is light overall, and is slightly watery. It's very grainy—toasted grains, little maltiness. It reminds me a great deal of a hearty black lager, to be honest.     Mouthfeel: creamy, light side of medium.    Overall, I am slightly disappointed with this beer. I was expecting more chocolate notes on the palate. Instead, it tasted much like a Guinness, which I do like. But I would have bought Guinness—not Young's—if I had wanted to drink Guinness.

The smell of chocolate, just cocoa, pralines, and weak coffee.  Delicate flavor, but instead of chocolate praline filling palpable. It is like a dry, powdered. Bitterness at the finish of each sip, good  Gentian gives us much chocolate, but if it is a "double"? Young's Double Chocolate is watery, it is without the body, and the density is low. When I first tasted this Young'sa, that was about 10 years ago, I remember it differently. There are today expected something more,  more chocolate, more sweetness and density.

I prefer a more robust stout than this style, in general, but this is an easy drinking stout that would be worth introducing to people who believe that stouts are "too dark and heavy" to session.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 L: Loos very dark-brown almost black, with light brown head.   S: Smells like chocolate, dark fruits, some acid notes, coffee, sherry and wood.   T: Tastes like dark bitter chocolate, the bitterness of the chocolate is not very pleasant, not as smooth as the hops, so I found it hard to drink, aftertaste is aggressive.   F: Has medium body and low carbonation. Not as creamy as other milk stouts.   O: This is a good example of a double chocolate stout that you can find at the super market here in Mexico. You can find much better chocolate stouts in specialty stores.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 16 oz nitro-can poured into a can-shaped pint glass.    Appearance  Pours black with an awesome nitro effect cascading up the glass. Leaves behind 2 fingers of ultra-creamy head with a ridiculous amount of lacing.    Nose  Milk chocolate, caramel, raisin, and dusted cocoa. The aroma is light but nothing short of delicious.    Taste  Semi-sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, and dusted cocoa. Raisin, caramel, and hints of black cherry. Finishes with an ever-so-slight roasty bitterness.    Mouthfeel  Medium-light bodied, smooth, and ultra-creamy.    Overall  Great chocolate flavors. Very easy drinking and delicate with a great nitro-can.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 Very dark brown to black. Very nice foamy head, cappuccino-like. Started around 52 degrees. Chocolate was most present in the aroma, but not dominating, with some roasted malt. Taste was consistent with smell, but with a bit of coffee, too. Was semi-smooth, wish it was creamier. Alcohol was a little more present than I would have liked. Feel was on the thinner side, but not too bad. Different strokes for different folks. If you like chocolate and a smoother ride, I suggest, for example, Samuel Smith's over this one, but if you like your chocolate tamed by a more traditional beer/ale taste, then give it a try.

This beer is what it claims to be, and not much more. Very strong roasted malt and dark chocolate flavor. The coffee is still in there, and it all finishes slightly bitter. Nothing complex to be found here, this is a chocolate beer start to finish.    F: This could have been better. It's just a little too thin, it needs more body to truly stick to your mouth like it wants to. Carbonation remained sufficient throughout.     O: I enjoyed this beer plenty, but I can't say it was everything I wanted it to be. Too little body and a slightly underwhelming taste experience left me wishing I had grabbed a bottle of Samuel Smith's Organic Chocolate Stout instead.    
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Definitely a quality brew. Dark black color and standing creamy head.  Strong taste of chocolate/cocoa and a hint of coffee.

Will definitely drink again and will probably recommend it as a starting point to the style if asked.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 February 8, 2015    500 ml bottle, tulip    A – Midnight black, topped with a couple inches of light tan foam, with fairly long retention.     S – Sweet milk chocolate, vanilla, a very light touch of coffee. Light earthy hop aroma with some mild bitterness on the nose. Perhaps a touch of bitter, roasty malt, but balance is toward sweet chocolate.    T – Flavor is also sweet milk chocolate with a hint of coffee, vanilla, and honey. Hop flavor is moderate, again earthy and slightly tropical, with a moderate-high level of hop bitterness.     M – Moderate-low carbonation with mild residual sweetness, the moderate-high bitterness creating balance. Silky smoothness from the oats.     O – One of the two beers (Bourbon County Stout being the other) that led me down the path to embracing and appreciating craft beer, this is still my favorite sweet/milk stout. So easy to drink, yet fairly complex, rewarding at different layers.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 DATE TASTED: January 30, 2015... GLASSWARE: Samuel Smith tulip pint... OCCASION: Shark Tanking it up on a Friday... APPEARANCE: pitch black body, as expected; rocky, creamy, substantial three-finger brown head; lacing webs and spreads like camouflage; handsome... AROMA: beautifully milky, creamy chocolate with some almond and vanilla; extremely peaty and toasty... PALATE: smooth as silk; a bit slick; mellow and purely drinkable--a nice, creamy stout that ends with a slightly gritty finish...TASTE: as chocolately and toasty as this is, it is the secondary flavors of hops that inject a nuanced dimension to the stout; lactic and chocolate, back at the end...OVERALL: having binged on this all night in a Brooklyn bar some years ago, I can attest first-hand to its sessionability; drinking a singular bottle in the comfort of my own home, I can attest to its deservedly solo treatment.. the only downer could be the price: $4.99 for a 16oz.er is a bit much, but if it's ever on tap and on special ...   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours an opaque dark brown, bordering on black, with some slight deep red hi-lights when extremely backlit. Moderate, mocha head, settling rapidly to a thin film, which does not mute the aromas at all.  And what aromas! Dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, and cafe au lait, are the most predominant on the nose.  The mouth feel is velvety smooth, bringing tastes that fulfill the promises of the aromas. There is the addition of some medium bitterness on the swallow.  This is the type of chocolatey stout I often crave, and this one delivers big time. In a word....outstanding!

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 1.25 | feel: 1.25 | overall: 2.25 This used to be a really good double chocolate stout.    Now they have added what they call "real chocolate flavouring", wich from what I gather is some sort of artificial flavouring, and it shows.    It pours pitch black, and has a chocolate and coffee armoa wich is quite pleasant. But it stops there.    The flavour is very artificial, and not what it used to be. This used to be a favourite, but not anymore, wich is a damned shame.    I do not know why they added artificial flavouring, but it has ruined a real nice beer indeed.    Hope they remove this bad artificial flavouring, and return to what this used to be, a great brew.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.75 Ba Review #288  Served On: 01/23/2015  Glassware: Duvel Glass  Labeled AVB: 5.2%  Date/ Code: 04/28/14    Got this one in a beer trade with a neighbor. Have wanted to hit this one up for a decade now.     Look: Pitch-black appearance. Initial 2-fingers of frothy sand-colored head with mostly big bubbles. Head reduced down to a thin coating within moments while leaving some random patches of thin lacing on the Duvel glass. Carbonation bubbles were scarce but present through the murky darkness.    Smell: Deep dark roasted cocoa bean. Creamy espresso coffee character. Faint hints of butterscotch as the glass was pulled away. A delicate confectionery quality was also detected, that of a chilled tiramisu. Most likely from the milk stout component of this brew.    Taste: Started with a thinner mouth feel than expected. Notes of dark chocolate and coffee upfront. The middle had some slight bitterness, like in a baker’s cocoa; definitely not overboard on the sweetness here. The finish was clean with some traces of chocolate and a dryness coming though. Aftertaste was similar to that of black coffee.     This was a beer that holds true to the English styles: nothing over the top, yet very high quality. Was expecting a little more mouth feel as the bottle claims oats were used and the word ‘double’ is in the name. Either way a solid brew for a nice treat during the cold winter months here in the Mid-Atlantic.

The head is a dense tan, creamy with some larger bubbles that leave a lot of lacing on the glass.     Smell is a bit muted, but has chocolate and coffee tones.     Taste is like the nose, but much more pronounced. The coffee and chocolate are followed by a slight hop bitterness with some smokiness and mild tobacco. This is truly yummy and with low alcohol makes a fine session beer with some rich foods (or without).     The mouthfeel is fine carbonation, but with a nitro pour it is like silk. This is one great beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 500ml bottle poured into a standard pint glass    Look: Opaque black with a bubbly tan/khaki head - the head has a fair bit of retention and leaves behind a fair bit of lacing. When I say 'opaque' I mean exactly that - hold it up to the light and you'll see nothing but blackness. It's a stout alright.    Smell: Roasted malts and dark chocolate - for me, the benchmark chocolate stout is Sam Smiths, and the Youngs doesn't have that in-yer-face chocolatiness that the Sams has, and it also has a few more dark fruity notes.     Taste: Roasted malts up front with the chocolate flavours following fairly close behind. Some slight bitterness but the chocolate/malt flavours are dominant. Again, not as full-on chocolatey as Sam Smiths but pretty damned good.    Feel: Good stout feel - carbonation isn't too excessive and it goes down extremely smoothly.    Overall: For me, Sam Smiths make the perfect chocolate stout - this runs it fairly close but doesn't quite match it in my opinion. It's probably worth pointing out that I'm definitely a stout fan and, along with the Sam Smiths Organic Chocolate Stout, this is going to become a regular on my shelf.

The rich malt and fruity chocolate flavours come through well and I thoroughly enjoyed this but just felt it was missing a little something to be really great. Hard to describe but a little bit thin in some way. That said I really enjoyed the sweet aftertaste and while chocolate stouts aren't usually my thing I would definitely have this one again.

look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 3.25 Opaque black color. The brown foamy head dies fast but creates strong legs. Visually a little dull.     Aromas and flavors of cocoa, coffee, nuts, herbal spices. Extra rich toasty and strong bitter taste of chocolate and coffee. Overwhelming spices and too bitter for my taste, should be more sweet.    Creamy heavy body with faint carbonation. Chalky with chunks of detritus.  Very long bitter and strong invading mouth coating.    An average beer with a treacherous smell. I find it hard to drink and tasted better local chocolate beers...Disappointed!

Perhaps only because of the broad availability and rated as a comparison to other stouts? Compared to the quality microbrews of this variety, I find it inferior.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I had this in a pint glass.  The appearance was a nice looking dark brown close to black color. A thin white to off white foamy head appeared and dissipated within seconds barely leaving any lacing.  The smell had a large amount of roasty chocolate-ness. Light coffee intrudes in a decent way.  The taste was basically the same and had a sly coffee/chocolate aftertaste leading to the same sort of finish.  The mouthfeel was somewhat sharp through the carbonation but smooth as it carried itself over my tongue.  Overall, in my opinion, I like this milk/sweet stout. I'd have it again as dessert.

Pours near black with a brown head that doesn't trail the glass. The smell is full of sweet cream and chocolate, very heavy. The taste is equally heavy with chocolate being the star of the beer with lighter notes of coffee on the end. Very decadent but overall a nice after dinner beer. For more fun, make a black and tan with this and Well's Banana Bread Beer for a chocolate covered banana black and tan, really tasty.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Appearance - Deeply dark with a heavy 2 finger head of dirty tobacco foam head supported by light streaming CO2 comprised of tiny bubbles. the head has good retention but eventually dies off to a sticky lace cover and clings to the side of the glass.    Smell - Very heavy chocolate aroma as you would expect from the name of the beer. Some toffee like aroma and some bitter coffee hints in the back end.    Taste - Deeply chocolaty and very well balanced between sweet and bitter elements. There are some burnt characteristics in here but the beer is essentially exactly what it promises to be. Also some very sweet Rum or Porte like elements are in here... I wish I could be more specific in this respect but I am not much of a drinker when it comes to anything other than beer but this one does reminds me of rum in some ways.    MF - Mildly metallic and astringent at the start in the mouth this beer is medium bodied and has plenty of tingle with a drying finish. The beer is also pretty creamy as it goes down.    Overall - A very good beer that seems to do more or less exactly what it is setting out to do. Well balanced and a pretty decent mouth feel this beer is one I would recommend to others and will actively seek out again. Seems to pair well with sweet dishes.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 On nitro tap, had this twice in a couple of days. Strangely, on the 2nd visit, this seemed to lack all the chocolatey goodness - to the point where my gf and I both questioned and received samplers of this and other stouts on tap to compare. Seems others have noted some inconsistencies as well. Anyhow, I love chocolate and I love stout, so this really puts it together well!

Wow, A self-brewing Canadian friend recommended this beer. So I drank it right now. I bought this beer at Fonthill's LCBO in Pelham, ON, Canada. Its colour and look seem very strong but it is not. Usually I feel stout is little bit strong to me, but this is not. very drinkable and nice taste. Like everybody here said, it has sweet chocolate smell, too.

A: Poured black with a tan-colored head. It's very difficult to see through this beer when holding it up to a light but there appears to be a moderate level of carbonation based on the amount of bubbles rising to the surface.  S: There's a gentle aroma of chocolate with some notes of roasted malts.  T: The taste is both creamy and somewhat sweet and filled with flavors of milk chocolate. There are also some hints of roasted malts. The finish is slightly bitter.  M: It feels light- to medium-bodied, smooth and a bit thin on the palate; the finish feels somewhat dry.  D: It's very easy to drink and goes down very smoothly; this is definitely a sessionable beer.

Tar black color, with a decent head.     Roasted, sweet malt aromas, hints of fig and chocolate.    Very creamy, smooth stout. A bit on the sweeter side, with bitter chocolate, and again, lots of cream. Carbonation is a little too high, distracts from the smooth overall impression. Chocolate becomes very flashy in the end, mingles well together with coffee notes. Metallic carbonation is still a little unpleasant. Creamy, bitter, long lasting aftertaste.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 First of all: it's a sweet stout, it's not dry neither should be. I drank mine at room temperature (18°C) because I think it enhances the smell and taste.    Look: Very dark brown colour. Nice thick light brown head that disappears after a while leaving a thick lace.    Smell: Well, the name gives it away, it smells of chocolate and malt. Coffee also is quite strong (maybe even more than chocolate).    Taste: Bouchet and aftertaste of chocolate, here the coffee is less present. Very strong also the bitterness of the hops, that gets stronger during the aftertaste.    Feel: Reeeeally smooth and drinkable, despite being rather complex and bitter. Medium low carbonation. Probably the feel would benefit from drinking it at a lower temperature (well, I chose a compromise).    Overall: extremely pleasant, can be enjoyed with a variety of foods (I drank mine with french cheeses and a salad and it was fitting perfectly). Definitely will drink again.
