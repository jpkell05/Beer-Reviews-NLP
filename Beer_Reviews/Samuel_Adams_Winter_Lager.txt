This is basically like a syrupy well done red ale in taste and look, with some added "winter spices". A solid beer and pretty unique. I can't say I have had one like it before.

Medium light body. Faint lingering bitterness.

Poured from the the bottle into a pint glass, this has a three finger thick light tan head, webbed lacing. and a deep reddish amber body.    Smells like masterfully roasted, full bodied malts. Also picking up the cinnamon and ginger mentioned on the labeling.     I taste hearty grains with not very much of a spice flavor, just a mild sweetness from the malts.    Medium mouthfeel with mild carbonation.    I'll rate Samuel Adams Winter Lager | Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams) with a 4.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Samuel Adams Winter Lager brewed by Boston Beer Company, with an ABV of 5.60% This German Bock pours out of a 12oz glass bottle into a a pint beer glass. A super nice mid brownish almost copper color with a nice small off white head. Decent amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. Really digging the copper color of this brew. The smell is rich with roasted grains and malts. Then a nice mix of citrus with spices. You mostly pick up on cinnamon an ginger. The smells of the holidays. So far Samuel Adams Winter Lager is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first pick up the light roasted grains and malts, then a mild amount of spices. The spices are a nice touch to this brew. This brew has a super nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. This brew would go nice with dinner or on a cold winter day. The body of this German Bock is a solid medium. The mouth feel is Bold, Spices, Rich , Clean Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Samuel Adams Winter Lager a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams), did a super nice job with German Bock.

And no, this pour was not into a glass that was just washed so there is no soap residue. Malt taste with a bit of spice. No complexity. Moderate body and carbonation.   
look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Beautiful deep amber color that invites you in. Thick white head and minimal smell.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Aroma of spice, bread, malt, caramel. Short tan head; short but thick and creamy; receding fairly quickly, but it leaves nice-looking lacing on the opposite side of the glass. Color is reddish amber; lots of carbonation bubbles. Attractive. Taste is spicy - cinnamon, with a touch of citrus (orange?); finish is mildly bitter and malty. The totality is definitely holiday & winter focused.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Best by April 2019, so plenty fresh.     Nice deep red amber coloring. Initially there is a good thick off white head, but this dissipates to a thick ring & covering. light lacing    Clean malty aroma. nothing else    Malty, tingly, a little sweet. Claims to be brewed with orange peel, cinnamon & ginger, but I'm not getting any of those flavors.     Mouth is around medium. Finish seems a little off, faintly sour and a little unpleasant.     Overall, apart form the finish, not a bad tasting beer. It just doesn't deliver what the bottle states.

Not too complex, but a decent winter drink.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3 Very dark amber with about medium carbonation as well as body.   Aroma is roasted malt, caramel,sort of fruity, with what I assume is hop bitterness.  Taste is almost identical to aroma, somewhat sweet. There's some bitterness which is either hops,indescribable spice or both .  It's ok but it seemed like a bit of a mess to me   
look: 4.25 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2 | feel: 2.25 | overall: 3.25 Bought buy mistake. Expected Christmas Ale and all I got was this weird tasting fruity, teaser of orange, a littile bitterness, that leaves a lot to desire and gives noting in return. Is that Pine that Boston Lager where trying to hint at? Who knows but they missed the mark....   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Pours dark amber with an off white head that hangs around and leaves lacing along the glass. The aroma is holiday spice and rich, toasty malt. There is not a lot of hop character. The flavor hints at sweetness with caramel and toasty malt but there is sufficient bitterness to balance the beer and keep it from being cloying. Spices are present here as well but not too strong. The body is medium-full with moderate carbonation. The beer tastes stronger than the listed abv of 5.6%.     This makes for a nice cold weather beer.

Sweet malt, spice, a bit of fruit. Aroma seemed to evaporate quickly.  Taste equals smell. Sweet malt fallows by a mix of non descriptive spices. Strange but not bad after taste.   Sweet taste makes it somewhat filling but a drinkable beer. A light holiday beer, I guess.

Clear amber-brown with ruby highlights, brownish orange in front of light.  Rising Bread dough, sweet malt and spice greet the nose.  Taste begins semi-dry and tangy from the orange peel and ginger, the middle becomes semi-sweet from caramel malt with roasted malt and cinnamon in the background. An astringent mineral twinge occurs, faint hops replace it. The finish bitters and drys as the spice and orange peel return and linger.  Light body, a little above average carbonation. Nice flavor profile; tang, semi-sweet, bitter.  The spiciness of a Winter Warmer Ale (label says "orange peel, cinnamon and ginger"), a little lower than average ABV for a Bock. Winter Lager, Festive Bock beer on the label.   I'm callin' this one a Session Bock with Octoberfest tendencies.

Smell - Malt, nuts, little bit of toffee and chocolate. Nothing in the way of hops. Fairly sweet. Maybe a touch of spices.  Taste - Very sweet and sugary. Not really much in the way of flavor. Caramel lager basically. Malty but not roasted. I can pick up a bit of ginger and orange peel but it's not pronounced. Medium bodied but has a filling taste. Medium carbonation.     Overall, not really sure what they were going for here. It's not a bad beer but not light enough to drink more than one or two and not enough flavor to make me want to buy more...Grade is a B

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This nice standard available in most restaurants   that serve Sam pours a nice red tinged amber with a nice off white head of foam that   subsides to a thick ring, thin light pool, and sports nice light lacing. Nose of caramel   malts tossed into light notes of light toffee and light breaded malts with a hint of   spice and orange zest. Flavors Follow the nose with a light breaded malt mingling with   caramel and toffee notes that have been dashed with subtle cinnamon and subtle ornage  zest flavors. Nice mouth feel; medium body, medium carbonation, and a lightly sweet   caramel toffee finish.     A macro micro---perhaps, but the beer connoisseurs owe a lot to this company  and this lager is a perfectly respectable example of the style done in America.  Nothing to hate and a lot to like. Overall an underappreciated brew that is   flavorful and respectable.     A solid brew from a solid company.    Cheers

But it is NOT watery (big score for a lager in my book) fresh without tasting like carbonated grapefruit juice, and warming despite being fresh, without being too alcoholy   The color is gorgeous - wonder if the orange peel helped.  Clear burnt orange with just the right amount of creamy, tasty, golden foam.  Great with food or on its own.

I smell many different kinds of roasted malts, cinnamon, an essence of toffee, caramel, orange peel, other faint citrus peels, and faint ginger. Lovely combined aromas.    The taste instantly indicates toward roasted malts and a biscuit flavor. The malt backbone consists of cinnamon, ginger, caramel, and orange peel. Bitter hops are piney and balances well with the malt. Feels light and smooth.    It's pretty good.

Clear dark amber color, with an evanescent off-white head that settles into a thin ring leaving no lacing. Big pop of tomato juice aroma upon opening the bottle. This vegetal character carries through to the flavor profile as well, providing an odd counterpoint to the dark caramel maltiness. A little sourness lingers on the finish. Quite disappointing, and I'll leave it at that.

The nose, is fairly minimal. Just a slight malt note.  Taste - is slightly sweet up front. There's a slight spice presence. Maybe more than slight on second thought. Kind of reminds me of a gingerbread flavor.   Feel is moderate bodied.  A tasty winter beer. Nice flavor and feel.

Beer itself has great lager qualities, drinkability, sweet honey malt presence, nice drying herbal hop presence on the finish. The aroma itself is very sweet and inviting. However, as a bock this malt sweetness is more toasty or caramel. Added spices make this beer reminiscent of gingerbread. Absolutely a winter beer. Spices are mild but present enough to make things interesting.  Overall will be killing a six of these on Christmas. Surprised I haven't had it before now.

The beer pours bright amber with short lived light khaki head. The aroma is caramel malt and spice. The taste is about the same starting with caramel before the cinnamon and ginger show up for the finish. Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied, adequately carbonated and finishes with a slightly sweet heat that is neither dry or cloying. Overall, good for what it is. Beer for holiday gatherings that's better than AAL but won't distract from conversation with its greatness.

Aroma is muted spiciness that I can't specifically identify with a cracker malt.    Flavor is spicy, could be cinnamon, and slight orange peel, but I don't quite get the ginger. The sweet caramel flavor dominates. The combination combines to remind me of winter, though.    Mouthfeel is light and clean with no aftertaste and a clean finish.    Overall a refreshing beer for all day consumption on a winter day.

It's a bock with a nice reddish look and a typical medium head. It's a slightly toned down version of their amazing Old Fezziwig's Ale, with subtler spices to make it a bit lighter. You can sense the spices in the aftertaste, but overall this is just a nice little beer to keep stocked up for the holidays.

I try all the other winter warmers, bocks, etc around this time of year, and think to myself, "That was pretty good. Now give me another Winter Lager."

It's tasty, nothing special but goes down easily and is kind of a nice change of pace from the heavier season brews.

T: Very much like a pumpkin beer, it is well spiced and decently tasty yet not a knockout beer. Good malts, ginger and cinnamon are not overpowering.     F: Slightly dry with lingering spice, crisp carbonation in a medium body.     O: Pretty tasty and a decent cheap option for a winter beer.

Sugary gingerbread and cereal feel, moderately bitter spices. Slick full body with with crispy and prickly carbonation. Medium to strong finish, lingering molasses, burnt caramel, wet straw, roasted barley, red ale spices, and leafy hops. The finish is plagued with an unpleasant wet grainy feel, killing the freshness.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 It pours rich ruby reddish brown with nice 1 finger head.  The aroma is very spicy with some citrus. The rich dark malts are hidden beneath other components of the beer,  The flavor is very rich, the dark malts come through much stronger on the flavor. The winter spices play a nice role in the background not taking over.  Overall this is good, it won't be a regular in my rotation, but it's worth drinking. If I'm ever at an Applebee's or chilis this could be a decent option.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 While watching a game at a local pub in Grand Rapids recently I ordered this one up since I like a good bock every once in a while, and this one was the most enticing beer on the menu at the moment. Plus, it was a good lighter abv option to go with watching the game.     This beer pours a reddish brown hue and is clear with light carbonation visible. The head is off white and creamy, dissipating very slowly to a rocky layer with a neck. 4.25/5 The aroma is very sweet and fruity with notes of plums, ages, red wine grapes, and dark cherries. It comes across a bit syrupy and almost like cough medicine. 3.5/5 The flavor has that same sweetness and fruitiness, but luckily does not come off as cough syrup. Notes of plums, red wine grapes, dark cherries, and dates kick things off before transitioning to wheat bread and then finally to floral hops that feature very little in the way of bitterness. The bitterness is light enough that it does not linger after swallowing. 3.75/5 This beer is quite wet but not coating and it is medium bodied. There is very little carbonation and no dryness or lingering dryness. It is smooth and syrupy, but also thirst quenching at the same time (generally not two terms that go together). 4/5 This is a very good beer, although it is quite unbalanced in favor of fruity sweetness. I did not expect such a wealth of sweetness and fruity notes out of a bock, but oh well. If everything lived up to expectations I would get bored very quickly. 3.75/5

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 The Sam Winter Lager is pretty close to my idea of a classic winter seasonal. It seems to be an agreeable dark variation on the classic Boston Lager theme, swapping out hoppy tones with welcoming spices. Better out of the bottle than on tap in my experience, it's nothing to write home about necessarily, but a solid brew to keep around for cold-weather sessions. It is a shame that this one isn't around a little later before it gets replaced by Cold Snap, the taste of which does not seem quite as appropriate for the depths of winter.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Dark appearance with tan head and just the right amount of carbonation. Very mild fruity aroma. Taste is very smooth grain with some hoppy and slight bitter aftertaste.   
look: 3 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 This was just average. Kind of like old Fez but not quite as flavorful. Pours pretty similar to Old Fez but just is lacking something. Couldn't quite put my finger on it. Anyways, it is worth a try if you come across it.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Dark amber pour with thin lasting cap of beige. Aromas are pleasantly malty bread, caramel, and very light winter spices. All of the smells are amplified in the taste - very full-bodied for such low abv. Tasty, malty, but never overly sweet, if finishes clean and neat. One of Sam's best recipes.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Enjoyed on draft at Parker Pie.  A - Really nice amber color, clear and well carbonated, a lovely cap with long rings of proof.  S - clove, nutmeg, winter wheat, hint of cinnamon.  T - Follows the aromatics. Nicely balanced.  M - Here is where the offering excels, excellent lager fels, semi swet finish.  O - A really well put together winter lager.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 This was more of a winter warmer than Old Fezziwig, which I had earlier in the same evening. It was an interesting contrast, and I didn't know it was a bock per se until I saw the classification on this website. I'd say it was closer to a traditional Christmas beer, which is fine with me.

Thick, chewy mouthfeel which feels appropriate. Finishes heavy on the palate with a slight sweetness.

Mild ginger and orange rind as well.    T: Caramel malt with spices. Hard to say what spices exactly. I get some ginger with a few other flavors thrown in. Bottle says orange peel and cinnamon. Not sure if I get that but that is apparently what was used.     F: Moderate body and carbonation. Dry and grainy finish.     O: Spicy and fairly complex. Not too bad.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Deep mahogany/ruby body, clear with fine updrafts of bubbles. A small coarse head appears on the pour but immediately disappears; between that and the color this now looks like a Flanders red. Still beautiful. There's pungent toasty bread crust and caramel on the nose, a bit of raisin, and a hint of citrus and cinnamon in the background. If the malt wasn't so 'raw' smelling this would be awesome, but as is it seems a bit unrefined. The orange flavor gets more potent on the tongue, yet still melds nicely with the malts which now seem more like a beer's should, instead of bread crust. No sign of the spices here, however. Finish is actually bitter, like black tea. Body is light, nearly like water, with assertive but fine carbonation.  The orange peel was a star both aromatically and gustatorily, delicious in its own right and played well off the malts. The rest was just trying to keep up; the malt, which as I understand it is supposed to be the focal point and thus delicious in this style, were ho-hum, even seeming amateurish, as if it was untransformed from the raw grains. It wasn't warming like a winter beer should be (in my book), yet it wasn't refreshing either. This would be great for the occasional 60 degree Christmas.

On the nose I get breaded malts,some spices,and small hints of earthy,piney hops.Small cinnamon and ginger notes.The malt notes are pretty sweet.    On the palate I get heavy malts,and spices,with a small hint of hop bitterness on the back end.Ginger and cinnamon as advertised.The breaded malts are nice and sweet.    The body is medium with a nice fizzle from the carbonation.The finish is nice and smooth,definitely not too dry.    This was the first craft beer I ever tried,so maybe I am a bit partial.But out of all the lagers I have tried,this one is by far my favorite.Nice look,nice aroma,nice taste,nice mouth feel...Great beer for the holidays!!!

Feel: Thinner side of medium, light carbonation, easy drinking.    Overall: Neither good nor bad. I wouldn't buy it on it's own, but it won't prevent me from buying the winter sampler either.

I don't smell much but to be fair my fall allergies are acting up. I am going to give this brew the benefit of the doubt.  T: Well this is where it is at I really nice and balanced. I hardly notice the orange peel, cinnamon, and ginger. I notice the nice roasted grain flavor that gives way quickly to a crisp but light hop bitter push. Once swallowed you are left with a lingering roasted grain flavor that is lightly sweet with hints of the orange peel and spice.  F: medium to low carbonation that softly foams giving a creamy fuller feel.   Overall, I really like this but I like malt and wheat beers. It really tastes more like a black lager than a bock to me but I am a fan of both. This will not wow the crowd that wants beer infused with exotic flavors. If like to appreciate a beer as a whole not just for spices or hops then check it out.

Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass.    A: Pours a deep amber. Little head on this one. What head there is is a foamy white. Medium carbonation.     S: Malts initially. Some caramel. Fairly mute, I would say.    T: As remembered, the orange peel is prominent. Some hops as well. Caramel later on. A little cinnamon somewhere in there.    M: Medium-bodied. Slight dryness.    O: My favorite winter beer, hands down. Takes some of the best traits from each of the various winter seasonals that I have tried over the years for an excellent product. Warm flavors without losing the hop bite. Will be picking up some more (and more and more).    Sam should consider keeping this on the shelves through February. Last year, this was gone by January in place of Cold Snap (which is not nearly as enjoyable).   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Sam Adams is okay, but I don't really get my hopes up with their seasonal offerings.  To my surprise, this one was pretty well made.    Look: Pours a light toasted brown hue with a quarter finger, off white head that leaves no lacing on the glass.     Aroma: Gently toasted, creamy wheat smell upfront. Rich aromas of caramel. In the background notes of cinnamon and mild ginger, candied cherries and burnt orange peel.    Taste: Crisp with clean notes of slightly burnt caramel and mild chocolate. Very rich and wheaty with notes of frosting and vanilla. Restrained flavors of christmas spices like smoky orange peel, cinnamon, thyme and even ginger follow suit. Slightly floral and yeasty, very clean tasting. Midpalate; notes of candy apples and bananas. Finishes dry on more flavors of toasted caramel and creamy wheat.    Feel: Body is slightly watery and bubbly but it works. Thirst quenching, yet dry. Malty, but balanced by notes of holiday spice and bitter floral hops.    Overall: I'd recommend this, just make sure you're buying it fresh, as this being a malt forward, lightly hopped beer - won't hold up that well over time as the flavor will fade.     If you're looking for a lightly spiced, malty, thirst quenching beer, this one is worth trying - but I doubt hardcore fans of bocks or holiday beer in general will fall head over heels for this.

Having never tasted this one before, I would not get it again and will pawn it off on relatives over the holidays. I am more of a Longboard style of taste. I would guess this beer is high in yeast content.

The cinnamon and pepper aftertaste is not my idea of a tasty holiday brew.

Taste has a big fruit yeast push, reminiscient of Pete's Wicked Winter Lager.     Hops aren't really there, at times this seems like a winter warmer, other times a bock. Has some holiday adjunct feels from the spice rack (nutmeg). Wheat is there, lightens the body, kills the clarity.

There are strong flavors of wheat and bready caramel malts with more subtle flavors of cinnamon and ginger. This must be based off the Boston Lager since this tastes like a slightly spiced version of that. It’s a nice holiday twist though I don’t think that it really adds that much. In my opinion it’s maybe the least ambitious of the members of the Sam Adam’s Winter Variety Pack this year.

I get roasted malt in the aroma with just a hint of the spices used in the brewing. Not a strong aroma but a pleasant one.    Taste is a good rendition of roasted malt without the underlying bitterness that sometimes accompany that grain bill. The spices, orange peel, cinnamon and ginger, come off more like a dusting on top of the cake rather than in the body. Good medium level blend of complex flavors that harmonize beautifully. Hops are in there but they are singing along with the rest of the voices and contribute rather than stand out. Finish is quick with just a bit of rich malt in the aftertaste.    Texture is medium, which is to say there is a sense of fullness without being in any way heavy.    I suppose I could call this a festive beer what with the spices and all, but it doesn't actually wander too far off the dark lager homestead. It's just a good, solid, well made dark lager that I could serve guests anytime of the year.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 I find these two facts interesting side-by-side.  First, Boston Beer produces 4 of the top 8 frequently-rated bocks on BA. Unusual. And fair to say the American palate would have to search hard to find this simple, unpretentious and sometimes delicious style.    Second, only 1 of Boston Beer's 4 bocks are among the Top 100 bocks rated for quality.    And a third point which is IMHO.... This is a much better bock than its ratings indicate. I Smell nice caramel and bready malts with some seasonal spices for background. I Taste very much what I Smell; meaning it is an honest beer.  And my mouth likes Winter Lager sitting there... not sweet, not dry, no lingering hops. Just pleasantly soft, yet enough bubbles to cleanse the tongue.    Best yet. I had Winter Lager with heavy, winter leftovers and it made them taste better. Who could ask for more from a simple beer ?

The aroma, fairly faint, was of slight malt and sweetness and very slight funk. The taste was roasty, balanced with sweetness and hops. Overall, a fairly straightforward flavor profile.

Finishes up a tad on the sweet side, bit spices come back around to bring everything back in check. Nice beer, can't believe this is my first time to try it.

Of course, I poured it into a worthy glass and admired what it has to offer. This one is 5.7% ABV.    Look-It pours a mildly clear walnut copper color with a nice whitish head. The lacing is persistent and fluffy.    Smell-It smells of dark fruits like plums and raisins as well as hearty rich sweet breads like pound cake, bread pudding, and cinnamon cakes. There is plenty of malts and abundant spices to be smelled and tasted.     Taste-It tastes like it smells, but with mild caramel flavors and some mild orange peel citrus.     Mouthfeel-It is medium bodied, smooth, rich, and creamy.    Overall-I love this beer, but it isn’t like earth shattering or anything. Definitely try it though.

Boston Brewing produces another solid brew in their lineup.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3.5 Poured at 47°F from a 12oz bottle (best by May 2015) into a Pilsner glass. Consumed on 11Jan16.  LOOK: Pours with 3 fingers of khaki foam that dissipates into 2 fingers worth within 3 and a half minutes. Copper in color. There is a plethora of small rising bubbles that explains why the foam head refuses to die all the way. Lacing is thick and moderate in quantity.   SMELL: Mild aromas of cinnamon, ginger, caramel, sweet bread, figs, and plums entangle with subtle aromas of orange peel, spicy hops, and earthy hops along with hints of pale malts.  TASTE: Mild wheat (suddenly appear!), pale malt, and caramel flavors enter initially and are immediately followed by mild cinnamon and ginger flavors. Mild orange peel flavors arrive next onto the palate as pale malt flavors grow stronger. Mild sweet bread flavors, subtle spicy and earthy hop flavors, and hints of figs and plums enter lastly as all previous flavors push on.  FEEL: Full-bodied and subtly carbonated. Goes down smooth and creamy. Finishes very crisp.  NOTE: A good beer by the Boston Beer Company. This was nothing mind-blowing, but it is easily likable. I bet if you took out the pale malts, this would be even better. I would buy this again of I was attending a party or planning to have friends over. Probably wouldn't drink this by myself again, though.

This beer's head really leaves behind a ton of lacing on the glass, though its retention isn't amazing.     Almost immediately, cinnamon and ginger invade my nostrils. You know, as much as people say Hardywood GBS invokes gingerbread - this does that very same thing nearly as well. Also adding to the experience are touches of wheat and apricot (though I don't get much orange peel here). This offers a very intriguing aroma, spiced in all the right ways.    As it washes over the palate, I initially pick up flavors of ginger, molasses, and wheat. Orange peel rounds out the mid-taste, with a nice kick of cinnamon finishing things off. It's not a particularly deep beer, but it balances all its elements extremely well.    Creamy and soft textured, this just feels rich - not just for a 5.6% lager, but in general. The finish is dry, keeping it an easy drinker. Carbonation is gentle, and this seemingly aids this beer's substantial body.    I've always felt Sam Adams do lagers better than ales. The standard Boston Lager is still quite tasty, Double Agent is probably their best hoppy offering, and Noble Pils is tragically missed (or is it - hi Spring pack!) This reaffirms that belief. It's not comically cinnamon-heavy like so many Winter warmer-cum-pumpkin ale offerings, nor is it some dinky, watery weakling in terms of mouthfeel. This is a perfect "please the masses" kind of beer that works great for parties or guzzling by the pitcher.    3.53/5: A worthy offering that I overlook too often in the winter

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Poured into cylinder glass. It pours a dark amber with a thick, fluffy bright white head and extensive lacing. It doesn't have much of a smell: bready malt with spice and a whiff of citrus. It has a nice flavor: roasted malt, nuts, some subtle orange, spice, and a slightly bitter finish. This lager is medium-bodied, nicely carbonated, and easy to drink at 5.6% ABV. Overall, this is a pleasant bock beer; it has a nice flavor blend and is very drinkable.

Overall on this one I have to say for a winter "gimmick" beer I liked it. It really hit a lot of those sweet Christmas notes for me. A roasty sweet beer to sip on Christmas eve whilst the children continue to come out and bother papa bear while he tries to write beer reviews.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Look: It pours amber with ruby highlights. The head is off white and leaves some lacing.    Smell: There are aromas of cinnamon, bread, dark fruits, cherries, hints of roast, and herbs.    Taste: The initial flavors of cinnamon, ginger, herb, and dark fruits highlighted by cherries is the first impression. Bread and some roast are also present flavors as well.    Feel: It has a light medium bodied texture, with low moderate bitterness on the palate.     Overall: It is a fairly easy drinking beer with a little bit of spark provided by the herbs, and dark fruits.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 The bottle had an "enjoy before date" of April 2016 and came from a 12 pack.    Into a Riedel Ouverture beer glass it poured dark amber with a hint of ruby. The head was light tan and about an inch and a half high. It's a very attractive winter lager.    I could smell the malt and caramel as others have noted, but I also detected a very faint trace of the orange peel.    The taste was malty and a bit sweet, but not overly so. I've had four of these over the last couple of days and on a couple of occasions the orange came through clearly. It was probably because I let those bottles warm up a bit longer when I set them out of the refrigerator before pouring. This beer fills the mouth, not like a stout, of course, but more than most lagers I've had. The carbonation is mild and the finish is very, very smooth. Earlier today I had a bottle with fresh ground peanut butter spread on a hot thick piece of wheat toast. Wow, what a combination. My new winter treat.    Overall, I really like this beer. I've always thought Sam Adams Boston Lager was well made, just not for me. I like my beers a bit darker. This one is just right for me. Given that it's a seasonal beer and only shipped in November and December, I'm stocking up on 12 packs to hold me until early spring.    UPDATE/EDIT 1/4/16: This was my "go to" beer this past December so I've had over 24 bottles of it. I reduced my rating for LOOK, TASTE and OVERALL from 4.5 to 4.25. This beer is so much better when it is removed from the refrigerator 15 to 20 minutes before it is popped and poured. I still really like it.    UPDATE/EDIT 5/14/16: Well I finished all the SA Winter Lager I had stashed away about two weeks ago. I reduced my final rating for LOOK, FEEL and OVERALL from 4.25 to 4.00. I nice everyday beer with lunch.

A: Malt, caramel, not getting any of the ginger, cinnamon or orange peel, smells pretty plain, was hoping for more.     T: Malt, caramel, hint of vanilla in there, some ginger in the aftertaste, but no cinnamon or orange peel, it's just no there, the ginger does become more noticeable as the bee warms.    M: Light bodied, dry finish, easy on the palate.    O: This is not all it's advertised to be, it sounds like a big beer, a lager with some spice in it for cold weather, but it lacks body, cinnamon and orange peel, it tastes like a regular bock with a hint of ginger that seems out of place in the flavor.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Written from notes taken last night, as I don't currently have a working computer. 5th bottle from the six-pack; best-by date is April 2016.    Looks very nice -- dark red-brown color, very clear with lots of bubbles rising from the bottom (they're easy to see with the help of a flashlight, but still barely visible without.) Nice layer of light tan foam on top, leaving a good amount of traces behind on the glass as it starts to shrink down. Never fully vanished in the time it took me to drink the whole glass, though it did get down to a thin coating on top after a while.    Smell initially comes across as mostly a darkish "beery" smell, just a bit of a caramel-y sweetness in there too. Taking further sniffs as the foam shrinks down, more sweetness and maybe some cinnamon(?) start to pop in. There's a bit of something else in there I can't quite identify, too.    Taste is pretty mild at first, but I found myself liking it enough on the first sip this time that the "sip" ended up being more like a gulp. Malt still seems to be the primary flavor -- the wheat is more noticeable taste-wise vs. smell, and there's a bit of a toasty thing on the end, too. Cinnamon (as in the smell) stands out more, but still very much secondary to the malt. There is an odd "something" in there that's not entirely pleasant, but I can't quite place what it is -- wasn't noticing it in the first half of the glass at all, oddly, but toward the end it's more noticeable. Would have rated a bit higher in this category had this "something" not started to come out so much toward the end.    Feel is fairly light for such a dark-colored beer, but not watery or overly fizzy at all -- substantial enough to feel "beery" but light enough to be quickly and easily drinkable. Does get a little pricklier later on, it seems, which is unfortunate considering how nice the initial mouthfeel was.    Overall, my opinion on this one has gotten a bit more positive toward the end of this six-pack. I may have gone in expecting more of a bock (heavier, stronger flavors, etc.) and also more on the "winter spices" end, but looking at it as more of a... well, "winter lager," as the name suggests -- a slightly darker/heavier and slightly more Christmas-spiced version of a standard year-round sort of lager... it's not nearly as disappointing as I first thought. I doubt I'll buy a full six-pack of this one again, but when I get one of the winter variety packs I won't mind having a couple more of these.

As other reviews have stated, I don't really notice any of the flavors advertised on the bottle, except perhaps just the slightest hint of orange zest. That said, there's plenty of flavor in this bock. A lot of malt but never overdone or too sweet, and as with many Sam Adams beers, balance is quite the main feat here. A bit of clove and banana bread, and a nice mix of textures which combines the clarity and light body of a lager with the slightly creamy head and gritty texture of a wheat. Overall, this is a really nice, spiced, medium-flavored malty beer that works well as winter beer, though perhaps not quite up to snuff as a "snow day" beer.

look: 5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 Appearance: Dark brown body with hints of red. Brilliantly clear body. Eggshell white head that is creamy and leaves good lacing on the glass. Good head retention.    Aroma: I smell lemons and there is a touch of a roasted flavor that I really have to bury my nose into the glass to pick out. Pretty faint aromas. Nothing really stands out here.    Taste: There is a really nice caramel sweetness with a hint of walnut flavor and toasted bread crust. The label says "brewed with orange peel, cinnamon, and ginger" and I don't pick up any of these flavors. It's a pretty decent bock but the sweetness is on the lower side. There is a slight tang on the aftertaste but it's indiscriminate flavor-wise.    Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is nice and smooth but it's a bit thinner that what I would expect out of a bock.    Overall: I'm picking up some lemon aroma on the nose...I don't know if this is from the orange peel or possibly the ginger but I don't think it adds much to this beer. I don't get any spices in the flavor of the beer but the overall flavor of the beer is really nice. It is like a bock that has a little less caramel flavor and a little more nuttiness. It is a bock that I would recommend but I would say not to expect the advertised spice. There is a very nice walnut flavor to the beer that makes it a good holiday drink but again I'm not sure that the advertised flavors actually add anything to the overall profile.

Fortunately, they're both mild enough and well complemented by cinnamon to make a nice filling beer with a syrupy texture. Full bodied, with a noticeable level of malts.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 LOOKS: Very clear, red-amber, small bubbles streaming up. Nice creamy tan head that lingers.  AROMA: Smells a lot like the Boston Ale, was surprised that this uses German hops, from the aroma, I thought it was English varieties. LOTS of that SA malt in the aroma, not picking up any added spices.  TASTE: Very malty, caramel, toasted bread. On the very back end, some very slight cinnamon. I really have to use my imagination to detect the ginger or nutmeg they use.  MOUTHFEEL: Light to medium, not creamy, but not dry either. Carbonation is fairly light.  OVERALL: It's a decent overall lager, an above average beer.  Update: 12/23/15... had on draught today. Very fresh tasting. A noticeable difference from the bottle I had, it popped! Still not much in the way of added spices, but very fresh and tasty...worth a bump.

look: 4 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 This is another beer that starts Samuel Adams fans down the path of only drinking Boston Lager. Sure, it looks so good that you can almost taste your hopes for what it is. Plus, you've heard about how they add spices in this lager, and brew it up with a heavy malt, so that it's a true winter beer from the winter environs of Boston. It may be the first seasonal you drink from Samuel Adams, because of all the promised goodness. Then you drink it and it's like . . . wtf? Damn! I shoud've just had a Boston Lager.    This is another old-school, "big" beer from Samuel Adams, but by "big" they mean a big beery malt. Beery Malt? Really? It is extremely lightly hopped (22 ibu) compared to today's beers, or even the original Boston Lager. The spice that they talk about adding during brewing is barely detectable. After trying this one, nobody could blame you if you decided to drink only Boston Lager. However, they do make White Christmas, which is pretty good.    The look, as with many of the beers from Samuel Adams, shows their attention to quality ingredients. It's a deep copper color. The head foams up very abundantly and laces very abundantly. Looks good!    When you snuff in the aroma, however, you realize that something may be amiss. There's just not much to it. Forget about a powerful aroma of grapefruit, pine or any of the other hallmarks of a modern IPA - of course. Also forget about the ineffable scent of paradise that you get in a Boston Lager. It's basically just a meh smell of beery malt. There's a barely detectable hint of cinnamon spice in the mix, but it's about a 1 on a scale to 10. Uh, oh.    The taste confirms that damn! I should have just ordered a Boston Lager. It's malt. That's the flavor - beery malt. Now I'm not talking about a Lagunitas Sucks multi-layered, syrup-thick complex of flavor combining sweetness and spice. I'm talking about a powerfully beery malt. "Beeaahh" as a Beantown resident might say. Time has sort of passed by that so-so flavor. The spice is really not contributing much. It may smell great when they brew it, but it doesn't do much for me.    The feel is fine. It's not super-thick feeling, but far from watery. With the powerfully beery malt flavor, the consistency is pretty substantial. The carbonation seems medium.    Overall, time has passed by this approach to craft beer. Perhaps as a reaction to the watery beers of the giant brewers, Samuel Adams brewed a hugely beery-malt of a beery malt beery malt. Did I mention it tastes like beery malt? Pass.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 12 oz bottle, poured into a pint glass    Appearance: Pours a pretty, clear, deep, amber color with a half of a finger of white-colored head that slowly dissolved into a nice lacing of foam that covered the entire top of the beer.    Aroma: Lots of toasted malt and notes of freshly baked bread. Notes of brown sugar, some nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger and orange peel. Very inviting.    Taste: Lots of toasted malt up front, giving off strong notes of freshly baked pretzels, followed by some brown sugar-like sweetness and some slight citrus flavors of lemon and orange. I’m not getting much in the way of savory spices, but the beer finishes with some nicely balanced hoppy bitterness.    Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with some good carbonation to tickle the taste buds. With an ABV of 5.6%, there is no alcohol on the palate.    Overall: This is a good winter beer. Good balance between malt and sweet and hops. Very drinkable.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Shaker pint glass, date on bottom of can is "JUN 2015".    APPEARANCE: pours a clear amber color with one-finger off-white head that dissipated slowly until a thin, almost unbroken layer of small bubbles remained, medium carbonation and some lacing was present on the glass.    SMELL: molasses, bread, spice, subtle to the nose.    TASTE: the taste is initially sweet molasses, this is a malt forward beer, next there is a mild hop bite with some spice, the last note is the orange citrus, there was a slight metallic taste that was not appealing to me.    PALATE: this beer has a smooth mouthfeel, medium carbonation and body.    OVERALL: this beer looked better than it tasted, it was good but not great, I would probably not seek this one out again as there are better options available, Sam Adams makes a lot of beers but many are underwhelming.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Serving Type: 355 mL Bottle    A- Pours a deep reddish amber colour that is quite good looking. This is topped by about a finger width of dirty white head that quickly dissipates into a thin layer that lasts throughout the session. The head retention just plain sucks but other than that, Winter Lager is a great looking beer.     S- The aroma of this lager is fairly complex and I really dig it. Deep maltiness and a slight hop character that is finished off by cinnamon spice. Pleasant and inviting.     T- Identical to the smell but with the hops less pronounced. Well balanced and easily palatable.     M- Light to Medium body. Medium carbonation. Finish is fairly dry. Slightly astringent.     O- After only having access to Boston Lager and Latitude 48 IPA for the longest time, I have to say that I was a little excited when I saw Winter Lager on the shelf.   Overall, Winter Lager is a beautiful beer that sports a strong malt backbone that is well complimented by a cinnamon-like spiciness. Easy to drink and quite tasteful. I recommend.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Not particularly unique or memorable -- just a good, solid beer for a winter evening.    Scent of caramel with a little hay. Clean, crisp with decent amount of carbonation. Not as heavy or filling as a double bock but still some of the same rich taste with the malt dominating.   
look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 I'm not a big Samuel Adams fan. Years ago when Coors was the best beer available, the addition of Samuel Adams Lager was like heaven, but now compared to IPAs and porters and microbreweries, Samuel Adams is just boring and unexciting.    My neighbor is a beer fanatic, and he has a keg in his man cave so when he invited us over for x-mas dinner, it was a no-brainer. The only problem is that he had just finished off a keg, and he hadn't replaced it so the only thing he had was this.    And I was pleasantly surprised.    This is good stuff. It's got a reddish hue to it with a head on top that you have to respect. It's a strong lager taste but with a cinnamon/ginger spice with it making it a pleasantly interesting taste.

The smell has bits of sweetness from the malt with some spice like nutmeg and clove coming through as well. The taste was a bit heavy with the spice and heavy characters from the malt coming through. A mainstay for the season and a very decent one at that.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Serving: Bottle into pint  Served: 31 December 2014    Appearance: Pours a deep brown with amber notes- definitely darker than your average bock. Creamy off-white head sticks around for a while before collapsing and leaving minimal to no lacing.    Smell: Grainy and farmy with some perceptible malt sweetness.    Taste: Much like the nose, the sweet notes from this bock are dominated by a weird farmy astringency. The bottle says there's spices in this but I can't pick up on any.    Feel: Good carbonation makes this one go down easy.    Overall: A typical Sam Adams brew.
