look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I really enjoy this beer. They've done a nice job with it. *Almost* a nice NE Triple or something. Sweetness of the malt hides the alcohol well. Not hazy or cloudy . Has a nice mouth feel but not at all creamy, just hoppy. I actually don't know why this isn't rated higher.

Taste: piney at first, and then the taste of orange peel, fruitiness, malt sweetness.  Feel: full body, first the bitterness on your tongue, but when that faded away, sweetness is all that's left, and orange peel taste.    An excellent brew. Will recommend it to anyone!

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 OMFG! How izzit that I have NOT drank, reviewed & rated this beer until now?!? Granted, it only comes in Bottled format, but still, I have had at least one every year since its inception. I must have been drinking them out in town, away from my keyboard, but it is high time to correct that oversight!    From the Bottle: "Distinguished, yet devilishly hoppy"; "Every year, we try to top ourselves by making the hoppiest, most intense and most flavorful IPA we can muster. This year, we chose the most flavorful hops and pushed them beyond their limits in this all-new triple IPA. This reimagined Hoptimum is our hoppiest beer yet, providing a blend of tropical and citrus hop aroma that delivers a refined yet aggressive character."; "We brew in Chico, CA, and Mills River, NC, to bring you the finest quality beer."    I felt really lucky to score a single bottle of the 2018 Edition & I was anxious to get started, so I "Use[d a] Bottle Opener" on the "Fresh Seal Cap" & began a C-Line pour. It jumped up to greet me like an eager puppy upon its master's return from a day at work! I got just under three fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, tawny head with good retention that left elegant lacing in its wake. Color was Amber to Deep Amber/Light Copper (SRM = > 9, < 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled very tropical with loads of mango, papaya, guava & passionfruit. Mmm. I don't get as excited for Southern Hemisphere hops as I once did, but this set my mouth to watering. Mouthfeel was medium, a little light for this big style. The taste was indicative of what I hope is the coming DIPA trend - a blend of PNW and SoHem hops to offset the (usually) cloying sweetness of the tropical fruitiness with the bitterness from citrusy hops. Here, the tropical fruit salad party was disrupted by the sudden jangly arrival of grapefruit, but the two factions got along well. It was still sweet ... ish, but the bitter citrusiness was not only welcome, but it helped to hold the sweetness in check. Not to be overlooked, the alcohol content cast a fusel heat on the party, reminding the participants to take it easy & NOT to slug it down as though it were nothing. Finish was pleasantly dry & you can bet your bottom dollar that I will be partaking again next year!

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Deep, rich gold color with good white cap and lacing.    Aroma of resin, citrus and a deeper scent I'll call ripe fruit.    Hops are upfront and strong, as expected, yet held together by an invisible cord that keeps the whole hop bundle continuous rather than strands fraying off. I can identify certain hop flavors but indistinctly because each blends with the other so well there is no clear line when one leaves off and another starts. Very complex and dry.    Brewer says hoppy and I believe it, not from bitterness, rather from sheer hop presence. Very complex and balanced with an emphasis on hop levels geared toward the true hop fan.

Not overly aggressive so far.     Big hop flavors initially, with medicinal and herbal hops joining the thrust and parry of citrus and pine. Alcohol comes on in the second half of the sip but quickly subsides. There is even the faintest hint of malty bread notes in the finish, not that this necessarily makes this balanced, but still. A bit heavy in the texture. Not my favorite DIPA, but certainly a solid effort on the style.

Has a off white crown that forms to be on the thinner side, but it has great retention and heavy lacing throughout. I do love the clarity of the brew though. The smell brings pine, a really fresh like pine. But other than that it is a little underwhelming, especially for the style. The taste has a sweetness that comes into play very early on. The hops aren't exploding in this and I have to say this is probably the most "balanced" triple IPA that I've ever had. I would guess this at a regular, not even a double, if this was blind. Not saying it's bad, because I can respect balance. Wet mouthfeel but not really sticky or in for the stay. Overall, this isn't a bad brew I just expect more than what I got from this when I grab a triple IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 The appearance was a nice looking hazy amber to brown color with a decent one finger white foamy head that lasts for about a minute and gently settles at a decent pace leaving some stringy lacing sticking to the glass. The smell was a strong resinous aromatic grapefruit drastically intensifying the more I sniff it. The more it warms, the more the bitterness qualities come out. The taste was almost a perfect combination of bittersweetness indulging my every taste bud and more than satisfying in every aspect. The aftertaste was a nice long lasting grapefruit of sorts pounding my taste buds into submission. The finish is long and dry. On the palate, this one sits about a medium on the body with a decent sessionable quality to it. The carbonation is just a tad abnormal than most DIPA’s as this one scorches me more so than any other DIPA. Overall, if Sierra Nevada ever wanted to rename this beer, they could call it "I Will Pound You Into Submission." Actually, I really do love this beer.

look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 12oz bottle, pint glass, packaged 5/25/17.     Hoptimum is lighter shades of amber with a short off-white head. It retains just a thin cap with no lacing to speak of.     Alcohol heat underlies lemon, grapefruit, orange marmalade, melon, and clearly a lot of hop bitterness. However, the hops don't have the pungency that one would expect.     They used a giant dose of malt in this one; caramel and lots of it. It threatens the hops with two meaty fists and they whimper and skulk away. Don't get me wrong, the bitterness is huge, a combination of hops and alcohol, but the flavor is singularly citrus. It's tangy and turns a little soapy in the finish.     The body is thick, almost sticky. The carbonation almost keeps up. In the deep finish, once all the carbonation fades, is when it drys and tastes like that soap.     Hoptimum is a disappointment from Sierra Nevada in my eyes. The malts, sweetness, and alcohol fight the hops too hard. Even this fresh I'm not getting my face blown off by hop flavor and aroma the way I should.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 2017 Edition    The aromas are first noticeable when the bottle is opened.    The beer pours out into a snifter glass a deep golden, almost reddish, color with a 1/2" slightly off white head that recedes slowly but visibly leaving no lacing on the sides of the glass. Before long there's a ring of foam around the glass and a thin layer of foam on the surface. Sipping creates arches, legs and small patches of lacing.     At first the aromas are dominated by the resinous and grapefruit zest of hops with some light fruits in the background but as the beer warms a bit more some of the fruits and the malt backbone become more noticeable.    While flavors are much as expected from they nose show more grapefruit zest bitterness than resin. There's also the mingling of some tropical fruit flavors, a bit of sweetness, and maybe even a bit of floral character.    The mouthfeel is medium bodied with some light but persistent carbonation. The long finish begins as the grapefruit zest and resin move into the background, allowing the fruits to move to center stage and reveal that some are tropical (e.g., mango and pineapple) and some are orchard fruits (e.g., peach and/or apricot). Eventually the fruits disappear leaving the closing of the show to some light but complex bitterness and just a touch of floral character as things draw to a dry ending.    Overall this is a pretty good beer if you are looking for lots of hops since it is mostly about the hops. It has lots of complexity with just enough malt backbone to smooth out but not conceal the very strong bitterness. Definitely enjoyed this beer. But that being said, for me this is a once in a while type beer rather than something to have as a regular thing. Also this is a beer to be consumed fairly fresh since when the hop bitterness recedes the flavor will show much more malt sweetness than it does now.

Pours slightly hazy/cloudy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, papaya, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper, pine, light honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, papaya, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper, pine, light honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/citrus peel/grassy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, papaya, lemon/orange peel, light pepper, pine, honey, bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt flavors; with and awesome malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy/sticky, and lightly resinous balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol for 9.6%. Overall this is an awesome DIPA. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with tame bitterness. Great juicy hop vibrancy and nice malt backbone, without being too sweet. A really enjoyable offering.

The flavor is sweet with a touch of caramel and a big dose of grapefruit peel and ruby red grapefruit juice, guava, pine. mango, and pineapple. The mouthfeel is very full and rich with a lot of sharp, fizzy carbonation.

I wasn't a big fan of last year's as it seemed too hoppy. Review is based on bottle I just drank, which was identical to the version I had on tap last week, as far as I can remember.    Pours a beautiful clear amber color. It is the sort of beer you see pictures of and lust after. And it delivers upon drinking it, tasting as good as it looks. You can lust after this all day, and go home and successful satisfy that lust. Ahhhh!    Aroma is of strong hops, like walking onto a hop farm, but one-dimensional. Taste is much more complex, with various hop flavors present. The recipe change has taken this from an interesting hop-bomb that I didn't really have much interest in, to a complex hop bomb that I hope they produce every year.    For lovers of hoppy beer, this is one of the best.

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 You smell this one coming as soon as you open it. Nice pine and fresh grass, and just a little fruitiness    Pours blood orange with just slight haze keeping it from crystal clarity.     Dense toasted malts accompany a bit of pepper, a bit of sugar, a bit of banana bread. Hearty with noticeable alcohol. Quick choppy bitter finish with an abundance of fizz. While simple, this is one to sip appreciate. Doesn't get cute or over the top with uneccessary flavor adjuncts, Maintains the qualities of a classic IPA while adding in some robustness. Nice clean DIPA.    Definately an uptick from prior years, Hope this is a formula they stick with.

A: almost one finger brilliant white fine foam head, clear golden copper body, carbonation  S: citrus, tropical fruits, sweet syrupy pine resin, biscuit, malt  M: medium body, thick resin on the tongue during the finish, dry finish  T: orange up front, hints of citrus and tropical fruit, medium malt, biscuit, hop oil resin, pine  O: strong brew, I was anticipating a harder hop hitting the tongue pallat.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Mostly clear gold with three to four fingers of tan-tinted head. Quickly settles into a thin cap and leaves modest, foamy lacing.    Dank, piney aroma with caramel and orange sweetness behind.    Lighter tasting up front than expected. Similar profile as the nose, with a kiss of alcohol in the mix and a measured hop bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste.     Medium bodied with a somewhat syrupy feel and relatively low carbonation.    Solid, but not as transcendent as many of the DIPAs available these days.

Smells softly of tropical fruits and malt, not overpowering. Taste is sweet malt, fruit leaning towards citrus and a little tropical. Minimal to no bitterness. Soft feel with a medium body. No hint of that 10%. Easy drinking deliciousness.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 This new version, referred to as a triple IPA, is fantastic! Light amberish color coupled with a soft-moderate hop aroma minus any potential bitterness. Flavor is extremely decadent, again without any bitterness present. The accompanied mouthfeel is none rivaled to exceptional. In summary, this new revitalized style from Sierra Nevada is better in anyway from it's predecessor last year.

L: Bright orange gold, hop haze, thin half finger head recedes slowly into a ring. Great lacing.     S: Herbal spiciness, grassy and leafy, hint of citrus peel.     T: Ohhhhh yeah that's what I've been needed. Chewy hoppiness, follows the aromatic notes mostly, with some added caramel actually. Bread crust.     F: Medium body, dry in a good way. Crisp.

Since the ABV is 9.6% (2017) I was expecting a super bitter beer that would be a sipping beer. Definitely not that bitter tasting however it does have a strong warming alcohol taste that lingers in the back of your throat. Very drinkable despite the alcohol. An excellent triple IPA.

Atop was a nice 1-1/2 finger white foamy and bubbly head that dissipated to a collar of foam with no lacing to speak of. The nose was clean and fresh. The smell was of grassy hops, grapefruit, pine and light fruit. The taste followed the nose with a lingering hop bitterness. The mouth feel was crisp, clean with a medium-body and almost a prickly carbonation.    Not being a 'hop head' this was my first venture into the Imperial IPA style. Hoptimum is not 'over-the-top', in bitterness as I was expecting. No, the Imperial IPA style is not my favorite, however, I enjoyed Hoptimum more than I anticipated I would.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 Appearance: Amber brown glass holds a solid half finger of tan head. Several carbonation streams keep it alive.    Aroma: Hop oils, hop leaves, sweet malty base with a little toffee, and more hops. Hops are mostly pine and citric with some earthy notes blended in.     Taste: Heavy malt base struggles to soak up all the hop acids and slowly loses the fight leaving a bitter, almost burning acidic finish. It's glorious, but it requires a bit of sadomasochistic love of intense hop goodness. The base is enjoyable but fleeting, just a thin toffee ribbon in raw hop juice.    Mouthfeel: Bit hot, medium body is a touch thin, oily texture requires a firm swallow, almost a chew. Bit numbing, gritty carbonation.    Overall: Big hop flavors, West coast goodness that I greatly enjoy. Not for everyone, if you are over your hop head days try something else, but if you are looking for a hop fix, this brings an embarrassment of riches.   Highly recommended.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 L- Pours a deep orange to almost amber color with an off white inch of head that lasts forever.     S- Overripe citrus fruits, blood orange, tangerine. Somewhat sickly sweet aroma that gets more intense as it warms.     T- About the same as the smell, but with a nice strong bitterness that lingers on the back of the tongue. Overripe blood orange, tangerine, and mandarin are heavy up front with a moderate malt sweetness in the middle finishing quite bitter.     F- Medium-heavy mouthfeel. Lower end of medium carbonation. Mild dryness.     O- It's a little over-sweet for me. That overripe fruit thing is so prevalent that it makes it somewhat one demensional. That being said, it's quite tropical and interesting and drinks easily for 10% and 100 IBU.   Good, but not quite great.

Aroma wasn't the juiciest, seems like they still went heavy on the Cascades, why not, do what brought you to the dance.     Taste is great, super dry and light toasted pale malts, way beneath the surface, while C hops, something tropical proprietary and and Simcoe seem to be all up in this. Hides alcohol very well. Chico yeast holding neutral. What was a neat divergence for SN here was what seemed like a total lack of crystal malt.

Often it's already gone from the shelves. It compares with Bell's Hopslam, perhaps equal, but with its own characteristics. One must buy the hoppy beers absolutely as fresh as possible, as the hops rapidly fall off. A word to the wise: I wouldn't drink a heavily hopped IPA more than a month old, because there's already a difference.

Some floral characters but not much more than that. Minimal hops which is baffling, maybe b/c it is 2 months old? Not what I was expecting.    T: Again.. juicier than I anticipated. Pineapple/peach/mango flavors up front. Followed by floral hops and some candied malts. Decent alcohol warming on the backend.    F: Medium-full body    O: I expected a hop bomb but got a surprisingly juicy and floral DIPA. The aroma is lacking but taste is enjoyable. I love the fact that you don't get the big malt backbone like most big DIPA's give you. Definitely enjoyable, but would've liked to try it fresh. Solid 4 out of 5.

Smell and taste are both an equal balance of rich caramel malt, a bit sugary like crystal malt, and a good amount of piney, orange-rind, bracing bitter hops. Pretty straightforward, but excellent potency and balance. Nose does carry a hint of the alcohol within. Body is a bit syrupy, with restrained carbonation.  Solid beer. Great balance between malt and hop, even if it lacked a wide range of flavors.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Opened 46 days from bottling date.    A: Dark gold, minimal head. Lacing is thick and sticky. Hasn't moved a millimeter over the last thirty minutes. Lacing is beautiful, otherwise the appearance is typical for a DIPA with this sort of ABV.     S: Piney hops, sweet malt, honey, wildflowers. Sweet yet thick and resinous.    T: Hop taste is muted but powerfully bitter. The bitter pucker lingers for twenty or thirty seconds after each sip. It is resinous and oily and strong. Piney and rich. A powerful malt backbone keeps the bitterness in check at the beginning. For the first few seconds, one could be deceived into thinking this wasn't a huge hop bomb. Then the pine and grapefruit rind blows up and takes over. No alcohol taste whatsoever, it hides completely under the rich malts and dank oily bitterness.     M: Thick and sweet. Stops short of being syrupy, but definitely a heavy and rich beer. Well carbonated. Pleasant but not outstanding in any respect.     O: This is far from the hoppiest beer I've ever had, but it has a unique ability to linger. Enormous beer. As far as wide-release DIPAs are concerned, you can't go wrong with Hoptimum. A classic that proudly represents the West Coast tradition throughout the country.   
look: 3 | smell: 1 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 2 Had on tap. Something must have gone wrong with the storage or serving of this beer since it smelled like manure. Straight-up, barnyard driving past the cows manure. The taste wasn't similarly tainted but it was overly sweet and not very good overall.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Picked up a single 12 oz bottle at The Malt Shoppe in Milwaukee. The bottle stamp indicates this was packaged two months ago. Poured at slightly above refrigerator temperature into a tulip glass.    L: Pours a deep ruddy copper, just slightly hazy, with an inch of light tan head that sticks around for a bit, falls to a healthy film and ring, and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Profuse, lazy visible carbonation.    S: Sweet caramel malts intermingle with fruit hop notes of ripe tropical and stone fruit--there's some citrus, melon, and raisin coming through, as well. There are earthy tones and some cracked pepper. The whole bouquet is a bit muddled--none of the fruits strike me as fresh-smelling, and nothing particularly stands apart from the rest.    T: Caramel malt and ripe stone fruit right out of the gates--a bit of raisin in there, too. This one has a nice balance between the malts and hops at the outset. The middle brings on greater intensity of hop flavor, with tropical fruit and citrus taking more of the center stage, and some of that earthiness from the nose. The malts continue to work to keep things in balance. Even in the middle, there's an emerging warming alcohol flavor coming through. The back end continues the aforementioned fruit flavors, with bitter citrus rind becoming the dominant note by the end--it's quite resinous into the aftertaste. That alcohol flavor does grow into the end, but it never becomes overbearing.    F: Medium-bodied, this one is extremely smooth and creamy, thanks to a nice level of carbonation. Although it has a huge ABV, that carbonation keeps things light and lively on the palate. Quite drinkable for a beer this big.    O: I enjoyed this one a good deal. While I would've liked a bit fresher fruit profile in the nose and the taste, this one still brings a ton of flavor and nice balance, especially for a beer with an ABV above 10%. Certainly not a beer to be pounded, it can be put away without a ton of work. I definitely recommend giving this one a try.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured from bottle (pkged 5/5/16)    (L) The color was burnt orange. Creamy 2 finger head and long-lasting lacing.  (A) Smell was resinous with fruit salad and citrus.  (T) Taste was like aroma, but more prevalent. Super hoppy with nice malt backbone. Good bite. Citrus, grass, and pine coming through also. Great blend of flavors.  (F) Medium bodied and smooth considering ABV. Dry finish.     With so many aromas and flavors coming through, this felt really balanced. They're all there, but not competing like with some other beers. Very drinkable considering high alcohol.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Pours a nearly clear fiery orange with an off-white medium-sized head. Head retention is so-so, with a good line of lacing starting early before disappearing later in the glass. The aroma is wonderfully wholesome. It's filled with notes of resin, dank, and floral notes. Sierra Nevada tends to have a more subdued aroma and flavor profile, but this certainly delivers great and boisterous notes in both categories. The flavor profile has plenty of resin hop notes, with additions of dank, pine, citrus, and floral. The hop notes are just enormous, and yet they remain balanced and in-check which keeps this 10% beer easy to drink. Mouth feel is bold, filling, and sticky. It has a medium-thick consistency that proves fun to drink, and thankfully fills you up before you can consume too much. Overall, it's a wonderfully hoppy beer. Despite the presence of hops, it does not seem "bitter" or overwhelming, which is a nice note for those who think hops are only bitter and always overwhelming. It certainly has plenty of character and depth to keep a seasoned IPA drinker thinking, and yet enough simplicity to smash a bottle or two in the parking lot of your favorite sports stadium before a game.     Served in a 12oz snifter.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 I wanted this to be great, and it was ok at best. I feel the price point and alcohol content get this pushed up higher than it should be. It is strong and flavorful but it just doesn't work out that well. If you have the option get resin or dogfish.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Enjoyed from a pilsner glass, poured from a 12 oz bottle. 40F    L:- Mainly a medium amber, to a lighter almost gold hue depending on the lighting and depth of the glass (I like pilsner glasses for giving a good representation of this). A one finger head which settles shortly. Leaves a lovely lacing.  S:- Hoppy with a light dankness (I think of a blend of good pot and cat-pee), a pleasing mixture of grass and subtle citrus. Has a present malty aftertone.  T:- A nice marriage of various citrus with the added touch of pine (rather light in contrast compared to other beers from this company). A bit of sweet malt and grass/bread combo which plays more prominently as the beer adjusts.  F:- Smooth yet lightly sticky. A good feel to compliment the bitterness. Medium build with a "heavy" effect thanks to a pleasing yet present amount of carbonation.      :- I always enter a new beer with a blind eye. After drinking 2 of the four pack (and gifting one to a true drink connoisseur) I poured my remaining single into a glass to enjoy proper. I was pleased, there is a big difference to enjoyment when drinking from a glass cup than bottle. I enjoyed this double and would drink again. It had a good taste and view to cover the 10%abv well. My favorite drink from the Sierra Nevada lineup.

Finger + of foamy/creamy lingering head that slowly settles down to a ring. Leaves some mild lacing down the glass.  AROMA: A bit of a floral note, alcohol, some mild pine and citrus, a honey-like note, and some caramel malt.  TASTE: Immediately get some sweet caramel malt, followed immediately by a good dose of a generic bitterness. Very mild grapefruit and pine notes.  FEEL: Medium body, average carbonation, a little sticky but drying on the finish.  OVERALL: A little disappointed with the flavor, especially. Generic, no nice pine resin punch or killer citrus notes.

Nose is a bit light really - tropical and citrus notes but not a ton going on which was surprising.    Flavor is fantastic. Big, resin, piney bitter up front and finish, nice spice and strong malt presence for some balance but holy hell this is a big DIPA. Not just a bitter bomb but a bit juicy, a hint of onion and grassy notes.     Feel is great - nice and abrasive but in the good way. Well rounded with a completely full feel. Really a world class brew here - fantastic job.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 pours amber with a thick head, so far so great.    smell is caramel malt and heavy hops.    taste is good, heavy malt and hops in this. goes down smooth for 10.4% but is a heavy beer for sure.    not bad but nothing special. a damn good beer   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Great looking beer with thick malty base to carry a really intense hop load. Its got a pretty thick, sticky mouthfeel that actually balances out the beer really well. The booze is present in the nose, but it's not off-putting and this things drinks really easily.    If I'm getting picky, I'd like to see the nose a little cleaner, but its got a nice bold smell to it that lets you know there's some serious bitterness coming. Well done.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 
look: 3.75 | smell: 2 | taste: 1 | feel: 1 | overall: 1.75 Look: Pours an orange color with a one finger beige head. Leaves almost no lacing.    Aroma: Smells like cough syrup. Hot to the nose from the booze. Chalky, overtly sweet cherry aroma. Musky, almost like wet cardboard to a degree. Not what I'd call appetizing.     Taste: Artificial, waxy, medicinal cherry syrup and cheap, overbrewed bitter green tea. A very tiny hint of tropical grapefruit rind tries showcase itself for a moment but it is instantly overshadowed by the beers predominant, unbalanced alcohol/sugar profile.     Feel: As if it wasn't acrid to the palate by virtue of its taste alone - the flaws are further compounded by how hot and boozy the beer is. The texture is thick, sugary, syrupy and dry with moderate carbonation.    Overall: Way too sweet with absolutely no balance between the flavors. I'm not sure what they were going for here. SN claims this to be their "Hoppiest IPA yet" but yet the hops play second fiddle to the overt alcoholic, syrupy, malty nature of the beer.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 | overall: 4 From the back label: "PKGD 04/19/16 11:59"   From the package date this is about three and a half weeks old.    Appearance: It has a very lovely dark bronze colored body with great clarity. The eggshell white head is thick and creamy with good head retention and nice lacing.    Aroma: It has a very lovely sweet tangerine aroma with some light grapefruit. Farther away from the glass I picked up some pine resin and some sweet malt scents.    Taste: It has a very wonderful pine resin flavor mixed with some grain flavor and a little bit of bread crust. Good bitterness throughout the entire drinking experience. A touch of vegetal flavor. No alcohol.    Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is thick and a bit syrupy which makes it a bit awkward with the strong bitterness. Although it feels on the thick side it is very smooth.    Overall: The character of the beer really reminds me of the "East Coast Style" of hop character with a strong malt backbone, even for an Imperial IPA. I found the beer to be outstanding and I would drink it again. This is the kind of beer I would pick up a four-pack of instead of a single. I will certainly be buying more of this before it fades from the shelves this season. I would not say that this is better than the other Imperial or Double IPA's that I can normally find on the shelf but I would still buy and enjoy it.

Tastes slightly boozy with some dark caramel malt, toffee, mild cracker, bitter floral pine, woody earthy grass, sticky pine sap resin, papaya, mango, orange, pineapple, and grapefruit. Feels medium bodied, slick and smooth with low carbonation. Overall a really nice double IPA.

Nevertheless, here we go...    Poured into my trusty Sixpoint Resin snifter. Seemed appropriate.    L: Pours a slightly hazy deep orange with a thin white head leaving fantastic sticky lacing down the glass.    S: Biscuity caramel malts is the main aroma, much like Dogfish Head 90 Minute. Floating above that base are some fruity esters and a mild but healthy dose of resin.    T: BAM! The intense bitterness of this wicked brew makes you wake up and take notice, but not before giving you a bit of a ride first. Starts out rather sweet, with caramel and biscuits from the malt leading to fruity floral hop flavors progressing through to dank piney resins. The bitter crescendo builds quickly about a third of the way into the taste and lingers long as sticky hop resins coat the tongue. The alcohol is covered well, primarily on account of all the hop intensity. Quite an experience, and surprisingly enjoyable despite the palate thrashing.    F: Medium-full, this is a real sipper and roller. Solid carbonation without being overly aggressive in an attempt to steal the show from the massively bitter hops.    O: This was a fun experience which I fully endorse as a must-try for all hopheads. I've grown to become a bit of a glutton for hop punishment, and this bitter brew did not disappoint. Beyond the novelty of extreme bitterness, it was tasty and well-balanced to boot. A+ effort from Sierra Nevada.

Beautiful clear orange amber color, although the thin cream head quickly disipated.    Although you can taste the grapefruit, there's only a hint of scent; everything about this beer is flavor.    Medium bodied, and lightly creamy texture, it's great sipped and rolled around the palate.    The pungent grapefruit bitterness predominates, but with a bittersweet character... It's certainly not a grassy dry beer like a Guinness, or as bitter as some British bitters. Although it packs a strong punch, like hop Czar, it's somewhat one-dimensional for me. Only the lightest biscuit malting, and any pine, rose or fruit aspects are very, very subtle. And yet the high ABV is well-hidden in flavor. It is a flavorful, strong beer, to tickle the back of your tongue...

S: A delightful clean citrusy hop blast with strong malt backbone. Grapefruity hops, bisquity malt.    T: A tremendous hoppiness with palate-shredding bitterness. With 100 ibu’s, this one is not for the faint of heart as it can be a bit overbearing. Some bready yet clean maltiness balances the flavor out somewhat, but perhaps not enough. Hops are certainly on the citrusy side, giving notes of grapefruit, lemons, and bitter orange. On a down note, the booze comes through in the flavor quite a bit.    F: Full body, moderate carbonation, a good deal alcoholic warmth. The mouthfeel is chewy.    O: This one was a hop bomb if I’ve ever had one. But with such extreme bitterness, it could have used more malt to balance it out. A quality DIPA, but a bit abrasive.

This beer fell into the trap of most Imperial ipas....heavy on the sweet malt to counter the high ibus from the hops. The beer poured a hazy orange with white head that is leaving some lace. The scent is sweet with some bitter hops coming through. The taste is very sweet at the start then finishes bitter. The Mouthfeel is fuller in body with good carbonation. Overall it's ok.

Poured with moderate amount of foam that was well retained.  S: Grapefruit, somewhat orange peel. Biscuits. Some sweet and caramel notes.  T: Ouch! I was punched. The flavors were so strong. Caramel, moderate sweet, orange juice. Medium to high bitterness. Dry finish.  M: Full bodied.  O: As an IPA whose ABV is as high as 10%, the alcohol hiding was done quite well. The flavors were so strong yet well balanced with the hops and malts. If the drinkability is concerned, however, I think I could not drink it on regular basis. Nevertheless, it's still a excellent brew I would like to drink it occasionally.

Big hops on the front end, quickly subtled with a sweet pear note and a touch of malt, ending with a huge bitter back end, but not so much to leave your mouth feeling gross, just a real nice mouth feel. Phenomenal IPA, and a prime example of what a balanced and complex Double IPA can look like.

It's quite bitter, but not too harsh due to the great malt backbone. Lots of complexity in the taste. Pine, hop resin, mango and other tropical fruits, maybe some hints of citrus. There's plenty going on but it blends so well together. Very hoppy, very refreshing, and not boozy at all despite being 10.4%! The mouthfeel on this one is perfect, it's hard to stop drinking. It's just a beautifully balanced beer for how hoppy it is and for how much alcohol is involved. I was pleasantly surprised and very impressed. I'll be keeping this in my fridge for sure.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a standard pint glass: color is copper, head is off white with great lacing and nice lingering top.    Smell is resinous, spruce/pine, floral, lighter citrus like hop flavors, then a touch of clean, toasted malt.    Taste continues the resinous character, a bit sharp but totally expected at 10+% ABV, but then the malt backbone comes through and softens the flavor; hops are similar to the aroma, floral/pine/lighter citrus; malt is toasted with no real caramel sweetness but more of a sweet flavor to soften the bitterness.    Mouthfeel is incredible for a beer of this strength, it is bitter and biting, but the malt backbone balances but without any cloying presence. Incredible presence, strength and depth of qualities.    Overall, a great beer, one of the best IIPA's out there, but unique in that the there is a sweeter/maltier backbone and incredibly smooth bitterness.

This was a great aggressive full on kick you in the face beer clocking in at 10.4% ABV and 100 IBU's. You get the hop bitterness and citrusy flavors and one hell of a burn going down. This is one of the best of you crave the hops!

Lots going on here, lots of hops!  Dark amber color, little head, with a little bitterness. Of course, the 10.4% will make you happy! This is a high quality beer, and not for amateurs.

You will want to approach this beer the same way you would a glass of fine Kentucky bourbon. A definite sipper not only because of the 10.4 ABV...because of all the flavors going on. Grapefruit, tropical fruit, herbs, carmel and some flowery notes. Lots of hop bitterness yet extremely smooth and earthy with a dry finish. Each sip you will discover a new flavor. An absolute bucket list beer for any true hop head.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a dark apricot with about a finger of creamy head. The nose is aggressively hoppy and brings to mind ripe tropical fruits and very oily pine resin. There's definitely some discernible alcohol as well. The taste follows the nose with an explosion of bright fruity flavors and thick resin that leaves quite a bit of bitterness on the tongue directly following consumption. There's not much of a malt presence, which detracts a little from the beer's overall balance and mouthfeel (which is slightly thinner than I want it to be) but as a hop-lover, Sierra Nevada really delivered with this one. A pleasant surprise for me, and something I would definitely purchase again.

Served just above fridge temperature into a snifter.     Appearance - Gorgeous coppery coloured beer, that is clear with some visible carbonation. Nice finger and change of head, with impressive retention, staying around for more than few minutes. Nice wall of lacing that sticks to the edge of the glass.    Smell - a hint of mango and melon sweetness, accompanied by robust heat and spicy notes. Plenty of resinous hops follow that up with a steady caramel backbone.    Taste - resinous hops, sticky caramel, some bright fruit flavours of melon and mango. Then boom, a massive hops overload rips onto the tongue, leaving behind a very bitter flavor, and some slightly roasty and spicy flavours. Boozy finish, but this is a DIPA that is tasty. Mouth puckering finish.    Mouthfeel - smooth, lightly carbonated, and very syrupy in that it will stick to your mouth.    Overall - a very well crafted beer that deserves it's place amount the most intense of the style. Tastes like a beer that is close to the advertised ABV. Good stuff, enjoyed this more than some of my other recent Forays into the style such as RuinTen.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured into IPA glass. The color is a beautiful amber orange with thick, milk-white and thick lacing. The smell is classic IPA: citrus, pine, and floral hops. Big, hoppy citrus taste but with a touch of malty sweetness at the finish. Really, really good. Medium-bodied with really nice carbonation. For 10.4 ABV, it's pretty easy to drink. This is easily one of my favorite IPA's.

S= Big and deep hop aroma that comes across as earthy/piney/resinous with a bit of citrus.

M= Heavy side of medium body with moderate carbonation.     O= Big and bold with a ton of things to like. Not messing around with its blast of hop aroma and flavors.

Huge, frothy head that hung around for quite a while and had phenomenal lacing throughout. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the enormous head, nice addition to the beer overall. Golden-amber color with big resinous pine and citrus aroma. The taste strikes a great balance between having a big hoppy taste, but still a powerful (and very present) malt backbone that hangs with you. The aftertaste is essentially a battle between hops and sweet malty goodness, will satisfy fans of both DIPA camps. Excellent brew and a shoutout to my brother who recommended it to me!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. "Hoptimum"  12 oz. brown glass bottle, coded but without a freshness date: "041715 C1 14:44"   $3.49 @ Total Wine & More, Cherry Hill, NJ    Absolutely stunning! In the past I've heard complaints that Sierra Nevada wasn't making hoppy-enough beers, and then when they stepped up their game, the same complaints were repeated again! Well, that's over - this Imperial IPA is about as hoppy as you can get while still retaining some modicum of dignity through balance and polished elegance (which is what Sierra has always done). It's not intended to claw your face and shred your tastebuds, although it is headed somewhat in that direction with it's 100 IBUs! As you progress through the glass you'll find that it changes as you adapt to certain flavors and become open to others. That journey will most likely be different for each imbiber, and even for each new serving that they try, but some notes that it will most likely include are: grapefruit, papaya, pineapple, pine/pine resin, lavender, apple, soft pear, dull herbs, rose, melon, orange/tangerine, and lemon. It's a sipper to be sure, and at 10.4% abv. that's not just because of the hops! Absolutely worth trying!

Mouthfeel is full for an ipa, more sticky than most.  Overall an excellent choice but was hoping for more of a hop bomb lol.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 August 2, 2015    12 oz bottle, tulip    A – Medium amber with orange highlights. Mostly clear, maybe some chill haze. Slightly off-white head is a quarter-inch, dissipates quickly.     S – High in grapefruit, along with passion fruit and guava, deep tropical aromas. Some grassy notes, along with a hint of lemon-lime. Caramel malt adds a sweetness to the nose, along with some light bread crust. Smell is what I would consider “thick.”     T – Massive hop flavor, again grapefruit and guava, darker tropical fruit. Some lemon-lime in the background. Light caramel malt flavor along with some bread crust. Bitterness is high but subdued by high malt sweetness.     M – Sweet up front, a bit of a syrupy consistency, before the hop bitterness takes over the profile. Carbonation is medium, with the aforementioned heavy body. Despite bitterness, very balanced due to massive malt profile.    O – This is the way I like my DIPAs; very malty sweet, a balanced hop bomb. Really good stuff.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 12 bottle into pub pint. Bottle dated 5-2015, edited 8-3-15 after trying another bottle    A- clear golden, orange, lots of head with aggressive pour, some nice sticky lacing with white cap sitting a top beer, some small steady bubbles rising from bottom after pour    S- grapefruit, possibly pine, Citrus and a little tropical (pineapple) with some malty caramel notes too    T- quite bitter with some pine and grapefruit notes/finish, also some citrusy tropical notes. Booziness starts to make an appearance towards the end as it warms    M- average carbonation with medium mouthfeel, some CO2 sting and booziness. A little oily as it warms up    O- decent beer for the price, I don't know that you can buy anything better given their low bottle prices compared to other craft brewery's. The quality is consistent, just not a lot to talk about with this beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.75 Look: Deeply orange, bordering on red.     Smell: Mostly booze and pine in the nose; for as many hops as this boasts, I expected more of an aromatic blast when taking off the cap.    Taste: Bitter grapefruit rind without any sweetness from the malts.     Feel: Not terribly heavy but enough to give you pause.    This is probably one for hop-heads and big fans of this style. Being mainly a pilsner fan, this is fine but not as drinkable as what's in my wheelhouse.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Serving: 2015 iteration, from the bottle into a tulip glass  Served: 26 July 2015    Appearance: Pours a pink gold color- there are orange yellow highlights or a distinct 'strawberry blonde' characteristic to it. The beer is crowed with a pearl head that quickly collapses under pressure from the high ABV.    Smell: Bright piney hops, grapefruit, lemon grass, and a pinch of cajeput. Nice hop nose. A pinch of sweetness detectable but just barely- this one is all hops up front.    Taste: Big bitterness, much more so than other DIPAs (e.g. Hopslam). The beer finishes with a distinct herbal bitterness which begs another sip of the juicy hops. At first this was okay, but I found that constantly being smacked by the bitterness led it to taste a bit earthy at times near the end.    Mouthfeel: I felt like this one was smaller on the tongue than other DIPAs. Not very resinous or sticky like others, which is sort of the standard with DIPAs.    Overall: Another great beer by Sierra Nevada, and one that I certainly enjoyed. In the end I think there are better DIPAs available though, and this one is actually a solid step down from SN Torpedo, which is one of the best, widely available IPAs on the market. Save yourself the money and get a sixer of Torpedo- you'll be two beers happier you did.

Retention is pretty darn good, lacing isn't bad either.    S: Lots of resinous hop with bitter citrus notes. Faint breadiness.    T: Big, burly bitterness up front leads into all sorts of hop characteristics on the mid palate- grapefruit, lemon, grass, pine. A bit of earthiness leads into the off-sweet hoppy finish which is capped off with a lingering bitter hit. Dense, but fairly well-structured.    M: Lowish carb & fairly syrupy body. Drinks heavy.

Medium in terms of clarity.    Smell- Citric and tropical fruit. Grapefruit and mango are prominent. Quite dank.    Taste- Quite sweet with a pineapple/mango prescence being more stronger than grapefruit and orange tones that are also present. A sweet caramel malt blends in as well. The hops really build up fast and the bitterness increases towards the end. This beer appears less bitter since the citric qulaities are high, but this is one heavily hop flavored beer start to finish.    Mouthfeel- Lively carbonation. Heavy is body and viscous.    Overall- Well worth the acclaim, and a stellar offering from SN. A hop lovers beer. Very fresh and interesting sweetness that goes hand in hand with the heavy bitter hop flavors. A must try if you have access to this beer.

The strong flavor of hops, bittersweet malts, pine as it was pulled right of the tree, dark golden in color, and a nice think mouthfeel. If you enjoy a fantastic IPA then look no further. This one is special. The only other beer that I can think of that gets as good as this is Stone's Enjoy By. Enjoy is still slightly better but this one gets as close as they come. Overall a 5/5 from me

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Drank about twenty beers last night and this was only one of three that I feel deserve a large review.    Look - Pours a deep amber with a three finger frothy off-white head that takes it's time sticking around and leaves a solid amount of lacing all over the glass as you drink it. due to the type of head it makes the body extremely creamy.    Smell - The hops are quite wet with this one. It certainly lives up to it's name for the most part but I feel it could have been danker than what it was.    Taste - Follows the nose to a tee with the addition of some nice ripe bananas.    Feel - Medium bodied, moderate carbonation.    Overall - A pretty good IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 This was ok for a DIPA, but it wasnt quite what I was expecting given the $11.99 price point for a 4 pack.    Served 39F in a golbet from the bottle.    Nose is very yeasty. The famous US-05 SB California yeast. That is the scent that rings strongest to my nassal cavity. I dont quite smell any hops up front, the hop smell is very subdued, and in the background behind the ever present yeast.    Color is good and very typical for a double ipa. Dark golden bronze.     Minimalist carbonation, as is typical for a double ipa.    Mouthfeel is heavy but typical.    Taste is where Sierra Nevada did me wrong on this ale. The most present or omnipotent taste is ethyl alcohol. It is barely masked by the supposed hop additions in this ale. Yes there is a dry finish and a strong hop afterbite, but I dont taste any malts, and I really do not like the hop blend in this beer.     I really wished I had purchased Hop Hunter instead, as that tastes so much better than this, and has a better yeast, malt, hop balance.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A - Pours a hazy cedar color with a fluffy, two finger head. Good head retention and lacing is present.     S - Was shocked by the aroma. Was expecting an overwhelming aroma of hops to hit my nose but could barley note hops all together; the ABV is well hidden too. The dominating scents of the beer are that of sweet malts and a variety of fruits, namely grapefruit and orange/ citrus aromas. A very pleasant sweet aroma overall.    T - Ah, now the hops come out to play. The aromas I noted prior have vanished and the beer does a complete 180 on me. Though present, the sweet malt flavorings are dominated but the piney hop flavorings present in the beer. For me, I cannot really note much else due the dominating flavor of hops; aside from perhaps some boozyness. I give the beer credit, it does not stray from its name.    M - Full bodied beer with an optimal amount of carbonation. Very crisp and dry feeling leaving a piney aftertaste in the mouth. Solid feeling beer and very drinkable.    O - If you like hops, you will love this beer. The nose will play tricks on your taste buds and shock you with every sip. A very enjoyable beer, with a solid feel and great presentation with a taste living up to its name. Well done S.N.

A good DIPA to linger over, as its character evolves without degrading as you sip. And at 10.4% ABV, this is not a session beer, nor is it one to "pound" quickly. Sip, and enjoy!

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Bottled 5/12/15 Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint glass.     L- Medium amber, great clarity, one finger slightly off white head.     S- Malty sweetness, grapefruit, orange peel, a little dankness, tiny bit of that Juicy Fruit gum hop thing. Abv hidden well.     T- Similar to aroma but with an added big piney bitterness. Alcohol come out some as it warms but it's never overwhelming and the sweetness really keeps it in check. On the sweeter side of DIPAs. Finish has some sweetness and a lingering grapefruit bitterness.     F- On the higher side of a medium mouthfeel but not that syrupy at all. Very drinkable for such a big beer.     O- Another great hoppy beer from Sierra Nevada and one of the best values you're gonna find. The thing that sticks out to me that most is how easy drinking it is for the abv.

Alcohol is nicely hidden, I had no idea it was over 10% until I started to feel it, and looked for the ABV on the bottle.

Grapefruit taste. Medium to full bodied mouthfeel with a strong and bitter finish from the hops. A great DIPA especially for hop lovers! will definetely have again.

Appearance: Poured a clear copper colour with a one and a half finger white head that slowly dissipates into a thin foamy layer that lasts throughout.    Aroma: Strong piney hops and a light citrus grapefruit aroma. There is also some caramel malts.    Taste: Mainly pine hops and grapefruit citrus flavours along with some slight caramel malt which is sweet and sticky. There is also some alcoholic booze aftertaste.    Mouthfeel: Full bodied, medium carbonation, creamy and sticky.    Overall: I really liked this beer and its hoppiness. It’s very close to a must buy for me. I think the two things that hold it back for me are that the caramelly flavours make it a bit too sweet and the booziness that comes through towards the end is stronger than I would have liked it. But having said that, I would buy more from time to time.

It is quite different than other DIPA's I've tried, specifically in the mouthfeel and taste. The taste is actually quite subtle at first, and very smooth. Once it warms just a tad, all of the hop flavor floods your palate. I really liked it, but it took a while for me to appreciate what was going on in this beer.

The Hoptimum is a study in extremes: from the hoppy aroma to the bitter finish, this Sierra Nevada masterpiece is the epitome of West Coat IPAs. On par with Green Flash Pallet Wrecker.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 I had been waiting for this beer to return for months. I kept checking the shelves of my local beer warehouse and at long last I saw a stack of them in the back that looked like a mountain of gold. I picked up a fresh 4-pack and immediately placed it in the fridge.    Look: It pours a deep amber gold that is crystal clear. Really this beer has a beautiful copper hue which you can gaze straight through. The head is ample, but quickly settles down into a foamy delicate layer.    Smell: I get a smell of maltiness and pine, biscuit and hops.     Taste: The taste is very interesting. I get a syrupy maltiness that is a tiny bit too sweet. It doesn’t ruin the beer at all, but I definitely didn’t expect that from the king of Imperial IPAs. I taste pine, citrus, grapefruit, clementine, black pepper, buttered biscuit, olive oil, pineapple rind, resiny bitter earthiness, clover leaves, and a bitterness that stays through the whole time. Well, it starts out sweet and syrupy with a tinge from the alcohol and then quickly gives way to the flavors I describe above with the light carbonation fizzling through most of the action. I get a lingering thick resin coating on the tongue that stays for a while.     Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is full-bodied, creamy, thick, and syrupy (as I’ve said a few times already) and lastly oiled and buttery on the finish.    Overall: This beer has 100+ IBUs and 10.4% ABV and a lot of flavor. The slightly too noticeable sweetness and light carbonation caused it to lose a few small points in the taste department, but nothing too significant. It’s definitely a great beer and fun to drink, because it keeps you guessing what exactly are the varieties of subtle flavors you are experiencing. Be sure to pour this one into a nice glass and serve very chilled. Cheers!

Appearance: Bright gold color; beautiful, sudsy white foam head and intricate lace.    Smell: Caramel malt, honey, pepper and spice, grapefruit rind, and vegetal (celery) notes.    Taste: Big malty body balances massive hops: herbal bitterness, grapefruit rind, pine resin. Slightly raw hop and alcohol edge.    Mouthfeel: Medium, almost full body, creamy feel and moderate carbonation.    Overall: Hugely hopped, boozy, but still balanced. A nice hoppy sipper.

The bitterness sweetens to more fruity notes, mostly grapefruit, and sticks with you to the finish.  M: Medium-Full mouthfeel. Kind of sweet and sticky.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Mostly clear orange-amber color pour. Big foamy off white head with incredible retention.     Smells sort of candied, and a little syrupy. Piney and floral with just a touch of fruit.     Very floral tasting, and fairly unique. I want to say lavender or roses or something. Almost tastes like I assume a laundry soap would in a good way. Lots of pithy green flavor and pine, grapefruit, and pineapple. Lots of resin. Very dry finish despite a very full, malty, almost syrupy body.     My review is based on a 2016 bottle. I had just rated it originally. I swear it was clearer and lighter bodied last year. I recall it being much easier to drink, and I bought a few packs. This year I am struggling to make it through the one. It is definitely a bit of a sipper for the abv. Drinks a little more like a triple honestly, but it does offer a bit of everything.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Not a huge fan of Hoptimum, but always pick up a 4 pack this time of year when super fresh. 9.99 for a 4 pack with 10.4% - that raises the score somewhat. I'm not going into too much detail, because there's not a lot to report. Personally, I don't find it intense or abrasive. Maybe my taste buds are shot but it's not complex, and it's one dimensional. Pine, dry, but not overwhelming, pretty drinkable. I doubt it's 100 ibu as it possesses a bitterness, but nothing overwhelming. Its fleeting at best. A very average IPA, that basically gets picked up because it's cheap and has a high abv. One interesting note. The bottle was packaged 5/12/15, with a second date of 2035 next to it. Cellaring a 10.4% beer for up to 20 years could be acceptable, but NOT a full hop IPA.

Lots of lemon, grapefruit and simple hop. First sip is sweet on the tongue, syrupy in feel. Very sweet but it really dries out. Extreme hop with a resinous coating. There is a surprising lack of booze in the big imperial,but I really enjoy that it is so very drinkable! This is a tasty summer treat for all the hop heads out there. Enjoy

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Originally rated 6/1/15 at 4.23.  Rerating 2017 version, bottled 5/25. I think I'll up the rating on it. Big bold hop and malt smell, taste is more hop than malt. Even at almost 6 weeks, well balanced. The almost ten percent doesn't present that harshly, but it hits hard. I kept hearing the buzz on this year's version, and even after having a bad experience with an out of date version at a local store that I will never shop at (partly my fault, partly the store's), I was really excited about this one. Damn glad I bought two six packs.

Because this beer fucking stinks. Kinda sorta malty with citrus, pine, and some bitterness that never quite comes together. Add that to it's too pale, and doesn't really sit well. Actually I think I enjoy the bitterness most of all, because the hop flavor is all wrong.    Pass.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 No hop character, or malt character with comparison to most other imperial ipas out there. I really tried to get something out of this one but it's just not there, at least not compared to the other big IPAs - I like to get more pine, dank, fruit, garlic/onion and all I really got was a bitter pine, but not even really pine. I'll probably keep picking this one up once a year because it's so readily available but I wouldn't buy much of it. Luckily Sucks was released at my go-to store the same week and I picked up plenty of that!   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 super hoppy double IPA, I kind of wish it was fruitier though. Picked up a 4 pack for beer week here in Asheville.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 12 oz. bottle into a snifter. Pours a clear copper with about 1 finger of sticky, off-white foam. Sweet fruit and floral notes on the nose, including grapefruit and mango. The sweetness is balanced well with a dank, piney aroma. Medium weight, and a pleasantly creamy mouthfeel. Floral notes up front on the taste, followed by an ever-increasing bitterness. Some fruit notes, but not much. The taste is primarily dominated by a hoppy bitterness that really comes to life on the back end. Finishes creamy and leaves behind a little alcohol burn.    Overall, pretty good. I'll admit that this beer didn't live up to the hype for me. Obviously, this beer is meant to be an in-your-face barrage of hoppy goodness, and I think it achieves that. However, I feel like there's a fine line between pushing the limit and brewing a beer that's a gimmick. I'll stick to Torpedo and Hop Hunter.

Even as it warmed I didn't notice the abv I also didn't get the overwhelming sweetness, but a bit is expected and experienced given the abv. Overall, I always enjoy hoptimum. Not something I buy or drink a lot of, but a fresh bottle is always a treat.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Experimented a little with aging. First the fresh review, then a review at two years (wish I had done one at one year):    05/27/15 Review:    Strong, clear amber with pink hues and creamy-tan, foamy head. Fine, sparse, haze or flecks. Medium head retention, superb, fine lacing on glass and film on liquid surface. Aroma is piney, resiny, mildly sweet of citrus, and herbal, promising dankness. Palate is exquisite: resiny, dank, spicy, peppery, faint citrus up front but stronger in finish, with citrus rind/flowers and black pepper in the background but heavier and long-lasting in the aftertaste. Retro-olfaction yields fruit, alcohol, olive oil notes. Decent balance for the IBUs (100). Can barely taste malts or caramel, the closest you get is raisins or dried fruit, but it's not overly bitter, either. Feels chewy, sticky, and choppy as you slosh it around, mediocre carbonation, not super smooth, but medium to full in body. Pretty crisp for the amount of booze, and mildly astringent. Warming and prickling aftereffects detectable but not overwhelming. Deceptively drinkable, but do sip and appreciate this beer!    04/16/17 Review:    I was pleasantly surprised that this has held up so well after almost two years since my first review, and within hours of exactly two years since its bottling. I know you are generally not supposed to do that with these, but I have the urge to experiment. The bottom line is, it doesn't exactly get better with age, but so long as it is properly stored, you don’t have to be in a great big hurry to drink this, as I can’t say it really goes down overall, either (my respective overall scores are within 1/50th of a point of each other), and it remains well within style guidelines. Certainly not the case with every IIPA. This one must have had the right hop flavors to begin with and the right amount of alcohol (at over 10%, not as much of a surprise after all) and/or yeast. My only real regret is not reviewing it once at approximately one year old. That very well could have been its peak.    Rather opaque and definitely hazy, a darker pinkish-orange apricot. Fresh version was similar but more transparent, but I do prefer the relative darkness and the satiny metallic sheen a more opaque appearance creates. Head is cream-colored and nearly cream-textured as well, though rocky and frothy on top toward the center. Superb retention, some lacing well above the head, some attached to the head. Strong aromas of yeasty dough, spicy booze, and only partially deteriorated hops ranging from tropical fruity to grassy to resinous to slightly perfumy. I’d say it has improved here, I don’t really care for overwrought or overabundant hops. Less bready, more fruity, spicy, perfume to taste. We have a tropical fruit blend, followed by a resiny to piney dankness, finishing up with candied fruit and then the almost too-strong flavors of leather, soap, and perfume. Very powerful, sweet here, bitter there, all with spicy booze to balance and meld it, and kicking up a peppery, spirity storm well after the swallow. Not as complex of a flavor aged at two years, but still quite alright. Medium-bodied, almost full, packed with a tingly yet creamy and almost nitrous effervescence that I think outdoes the fresh version. Hotter than hell, as expected, but the bitterness and touch of astringency help subdue it. Improved mouthfeel a bit, comparing to my original review's description. I would re-rate it at 4.25, 4, 4.25, 4.5, with an overall of 4.25.

The foam dome wasn't having it with the humidity but it was pretty tame and got the whole bottle in there no problem. 2 finger length head.    S - Cascade hops hits your nose through the entire inhalation. Cascade heaven =]    T - very similar to the Pale Ale but with the same character as a Double IPA. Citrusy hop notes all the way with a nice bitter finish.    F - So drinkable, it's dangerous! Slight ABV burn on the palate but overall citrus-bitter character.     O - First All-Five rating I have ever given. Must-have for all Sierra Nevada fans and Double/Imperial IPA drinkers alike. They did a fine job in making and branding this beer and it should be duly noted as such.     Hopheads Unite!!!

This one is pungent with the hops and juices! Grapefruit and caramel come out as well.     Just like the nose, the taste is very juicy and hop-forward. Sweetness is up front like a truck (caramel or syrup). Then comes the pine, hop resin, grapefruit, lemon candy, and floral tones.     Mouth is fairly thick with little carbonation. It's creamy and full bodied.     Overall, the Hoptimum exceeded my expectations as far as flavor-packed. The taste is so intense but so good. It is definitely not for sessioning! Sierra Nevada did a great job on this one.

S: Pungent spicy and pine hops, some herbal and dank notes, a little citrus, a hint of fruitiness, and some caramel malt sweetness.     T: Beautiful fresh hops, pine, spicy notes, some citrus, grapefruit, herbal and dank notes, faint fruity notes, peach and melon (came out more as it warmed), nice caramel malt sweetness, and a hint of alcohol.    M: Towards the fuller end of medium body, moderate carbonation, creamy with a little warmth.    O: One of the advantages of being right in SN's backyard is getting to have this super fresh. Big bold delicious brew.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Bottled 6/28/14, so nearly a year old.    Decent retention and some lacing.    Smell is foremost alcohol. Behind that is a layer of floral, kind of sweet-piney feel with a tinge of mold.    Taste is dominated by the alcohol-floral tones. Certainly bitter to the point of almost being astringent, lingers for quite awhile. This is balanced by a peculiar sweetness however.    Satisfying feel, not as heavy as expected for the ABV.    Overall I think the age on this particular bottle robbed it of some of its merits. It just wasn't as intense as it presents itself to be, though I can tell the potential is there. Would like to try a fresher release in the future.

Foam settles to a thin floating film, small lines of lace.  Smell is all hops, citrus, herbal, grapefruit.  Taste is the same, lots of hoppy bitterness, citrus and pink grapefruit, herbal and grassy. Despite the huge amount of hops, still some malt to balance and keep from burning your tongue with the bitterness. Alcohol is hidden behind, slightly oily mouth feel.   Good level of carbonation, finishes crisp, not too heavy.  A very tasty, balanced Double IPA.

The truth is, it is hoppy I can't drink much of it straight up and I applied my license at mixology to make very interesting hybrid beers using this like hop head jet fuel. So you don't get the wrong idea, I do enjoy Ruination and West Coast IPA. In summary, this beer is pretty special.

On drinking it left some nice lacing. Very floral aroma, pine, citrus, resin. A big whack of hops but pleasantly so. The bitterness dominates the taste but there is also a nice underlying malty sweetness. Medium to full bodied, thick texture, semi dry finish and a gentle alcohol warmth. Plenty of hops but some lovely balance to this one makes it very approachable. 9.

Lots of sticky lacing.    S- Hops rule. Grapefruit, spice, woody, and a bit boozy. I wasn't buying the "rose" description until I smelled for myself. It's so floral, in fact, "Rose"? - I'll give it that.    T- More hops: grapefruit and orange citrus. Floral, spicy and earthy. Sweet bready malts, too.    M- Full body. Syrupy, resinous, boozy. Tangy with a hop bite and enough sweet balance for a pleasant finish.    O- I like that it's not a sugar bomb. At 10.4% abv, it's under control.

Head lasts for ages. Nice soapy lacing on the walls of the glass is left behind.   S - Sweet sweet oranges, grapefruit, apples, tangerines, persimmons, hops and a light touch of caramel. Fantastic nose on this IPA.   T - Jaw droppingly good. An immediate an intense bitter bite which fades and develops into a lovely sweet bouquet of citrus. Sweet apples, oranges, grapefruit meat and hops. Lots of boozy warming goodness.   O - An absolutely amazing IPA. Something any true IPA fan needs to try in their lifetime. Fantastic.   V - Four pack of bottles, worth it at any price for an IPA fan I'd imagine.

A: Pours a golden amber color with a white head, lots of lacing, beer is clear.    A: Lots of aroma, pine, resin, needles, grapefruit peel along with a hint of guava and mango, not getting any malt on this one but lots of hops, very nice.    T: Like the nose, big hits of freshly cut pine needles, resin, there's also some grapefruit peel, hit of moderate bitterness that lingers in the middle, finish has more pine and grapefruit with a touch of guava adding a slight tropical note, finish is dry, alcohol is well hidden, very nice.    M: Medium bodied with a big dry finish, leaves a citrus dryness in the mouth.    O: This is a major improvement over previous editions, Sierra Nevada really brought the hops on this, it's also amazingly smooth for such a big beer, good amount of bitterness that doesn't overwhelm the beer's other notes, definitely going to be drinking this while it's available.    Edit: I had the previous versions several times and I really enjoyed it. The previous version did have a hop presence but was more on the sweet malty end of the spectrum, the newer version has traded for more hops and less malt. I think this makes it more relevant to today's context.

Love the dry finish and would definately recommend.

Great beer, super powered hops, tastes great. Can only drink it once in a while, though. It's great after working outside for a few hours, but you'll only want the one. Very powerful hops. Wonderful.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This beer pours a beautiful shade of copper with a huge frothy off white head with good retention. Good carbonation and excellent lacing. Smell is floral and pine with a side of grapefruit, sweet smelling malts are also prominent. Taste is exactly the same with a great deal of hop bitterness that dances on the tongue. Feel is medium and resinous. Overall this is a fantastic double IPA. This along with a few stone offerings are what originally turned me into a hop head. Absolutely a must buy for me every year.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Imperial or Double IPA (India Pale Ale) what is the difference? Is beer terminology becoming too archaic? Which terminology do you prefer to use? In answer to these questions: Nothing, yes, and I prefer Double IPA (“Imperial” is a bit of an anachronistic term dating back to when English brewers were trying to sway Russian Imperial Czars into drinking their beers). Now that we have established that: #450 is another milestone review which warranted Sierra Nevada’s best - they declare this DIPA as their most insanely hoppy brew at 10.4% ABV and I say “Ave at it!”.    Poured from a 355ml bottle into a nonic pint.    A: Hazy, bright ethereal orange body with a bold half centimetre cream coloured head atop. Fantastic that it even managed at head at such a high ABV. 9/10.    S: There’s a massive hop assault on the olfactory senses, but it isn’t as complex as expected... pretty much starburst orange, grapefruit and pine notes, that’s it. Still I’m liking the massiveness of the hops. 8/10.    T: It’s big and sweet, almost a sugar-bomb, then the hops come out and say “Uh-uh, sugar, time to succumb to my bitter glory!” and slap down with a nice big bitter hop finish that is very well balanced. There is a mixture of hop flavours swirling around: starburst orange candy, pine, grapefruit and juicy fruit chewing gum hints abound and easily make your tongue their slave. There are malt characters as well providing a tasty sweet caramel sheen to everything. The finish is impressive in how light the bitterness manages to be given the hop onslaught. That said it is not for the faint of heart - this DIPA is big and demands your immediate flavour attention, and I commend it for that. 9/10.    M: As well as having a big flavour profile the body is quite viscous and coats your tongue in its glorious hop resins like some sort of giant hop blanket. There is a minimal carbonation trying to compete with this viscosity, but overall you may need a glass of water to see this brew through. 8/10.    D: Well I didn’t expect anything less than a bolder, more viscous version of Torpedo and Hoptimum delivers well. I would have to say this is a damn fine benchmark to aspire to if you’re brewing a DIPA and it is definitely a beer that will see itself in my fridge again in the not so distant future. Cheers Sierra Nevada! 8/10.    Food match: Big ales require big flavours, in this respect I am recommending a Habanero Beef Stew or Chicken Vindaloo... If you do this please send me a video.

Appearance - Gold, great lacing    Smell - Incredibly resinous with some grapefruit rind. A little of the alcohol heat coming through on the back end    Taste - Pine, Citric Rind, Alcoholic burn on the back end.    Mouthfeel - Medium-dry finish    Overall - One of the best DIPAs out there. No tricks with any of the new tropical, fruity

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 IMHO, this brewery can do no wrong. Will this beer prove otherwise. Here goes:    L: Orange-amber, clear and see-through, one-inch head and a ton of lacing. Good.    S: Very piney. Some grapefruit and lemon in the hops as well. Also a great honey-malt backbone. Reminds me of a more mellow DFH 90 min.    T: Excellent. Just like DFH 90 min, but somewhat not quite as good. Initial taste of caramel and honey followed by piney malt.    F: Excellent. Thick and sticky pine. Great.    O: Lovely IPA. Will have again.
