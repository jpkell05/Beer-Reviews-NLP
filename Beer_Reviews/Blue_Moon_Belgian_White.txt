look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 I can see why many people use this as their entry-level Belgian wheat beer. I remember trying this many years ago and wasn’t too impressed at the time but my palate was only used to drinking light beers and basic domestics. This one actually pleasantly surprised me with its taste and balance. Pours a slightly hazy yellow-orange color with a little scant lasting foamy white head and almost no lacing. Smells faintly of some Belgian yeast, banana and clove, hops and malt. Taste follows the nose but the Belgian yeast was not unpleasant at all, and was actually rather muted. I could see how trying this beer on tap with a nice twist of orange peel could be very pleasant. Smooth, mild, thin mouthfeel with good carbonation. All in all, not a bad beer, and one that I would definitely try again especially on tap.

Hazy orange, orange zest & coriander aroma, has a soft sweetness balanced by a zesty citrus, all rounded out by a wheaty taste and feel that lingers but doesnt overpower. Lacks depth but not in a bad way.  It's kind of perfect - not because it's the best beer, but because it's consistent, ubiquitous, and just damn pleasant to drink.    And dont forget to twist and steep your garnish orange when you get it on draft.  Never forget the twist!!

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Funny that this beer was labeled as the "number one craft beer in America"... and it is made by Coors?  Although I must admit that it isn't that bad. The best thing, first and foremost is that I didn't smell or taste the sick Belgian yeast in it. Instead I started feeling the orange in the aroma after it warmed up a little. The taste followed with semi-tasteless yeast and slight orangey citrus flavors and a tiny amount of sour feeling. Altogether the body was fairly light but still on the wheat beer side. Okay to drink, at least it didn't make me sick as a normal wheat would be. The (canned) orange flavor is also much better than Kronenbourg or Hoegaarden for example, not as aggressive or in your face. I can imagine it being nice on tap with a slice of orange in the glass.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 My rating on this is for tap only. This isn't a beer I would ever buy in bottles or cans. Blue Moon is a beer you get at a restaurant/bar that only has Miller Lite, Budweiser, and this on tap. In that case, this with a slice of orange is actually, dare I say it, enjoyable. I'm not afraid to admit it.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 (This is not a professional review, I'm still new to beer and just giving my simple minded opinion)    Starts out wonderful with a medium bitterness, light carbonation, creamy smooth and an unrecognizable but pleasant aftertaste, that is at first. Not even after my first bottle, it started becoming worse and overwhelming (but still not unbearable) near the bottom of the bottle. I don't know why this happened, but it really ruined the mood that it initially gave me. Still very much drinkable, but also far more expensive, I'd opt. for something else, for the price, but not overall a bad beer, and that's coming from someone who's not a huge fan of beer! (Still trying though!)

look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 1.75 | overall: 1.75 L- Pale amber, hazy, with some sludge remaining in bottle. Pours with 1Cm+ fine-bibble white head  S- Sour orange  T- Certainly citrus on the front, some spices on the 2nd mouthful.   F- A bit rich for me, verging to some sweetness as it warms a bit. Make sure you serve and drink well chilled. Rather over-carbonated for my taste, I can feel the swallowed CO2 in my stomach which is pretty weird.  O- I feel slightly conned by this beer. Usually I wouldn't buy a Molsen-Coors beer in 100 years. Here they've done what seems increasingly common, a brewery appears to produce a beer styled as if it is from 'XYZ Brewing Company', in this case 'Blue Moon Brewing Company' aka mega-industrial brewers Molson-Coors. It wasn't until I came here I saw the true source, and I got my microscope out to read the back lable to find the facts.   The bottle doesn't have a full list of ingredients and I'm not sure how that's legal. The back lable says it contains barley, wheat and oats, something I can't say I've ever heard of in a European 'white' beer. The front lable says it contains orange peel, but omits to mention it contains coriander which you'll find listed on the brewers website.   BB 30/6/19, 330ml bottle. Bought somewhere in the London area of the UK. Not one I'll be buying again.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 12 Oz Bottle poured into glass  Look - Cloudy golden yellow. Thick foam head and some glass lacing  Smell - Orange peel and wheat with some lingering earth spices. Not a great beer aroma but an excellent aroma within this style.  Taste - It's a smooth wheat beer with a solid flavor profile. It doesn't overdo with fake orange flavor or too much coriander. One of those beers that just works well when you want some fruity grains character but you don't want too much bitterness or sweetness.    Overall, its a good beer nuff said. We don't need to overanalyze how it could be better. I've never had it on draft but i would think it would taste just a bit fresher and better. Grade is a B+

But for a $1 it is good.

Decent head but little lacing with a cloudy yellow body.    Smell was nicely fruity. The taste was fruity, sweet and a bit artificial. The lemony fruity taste was somewhat over emphasized. I know I have had this beer where it tasted better and more subtle. I will continue to drink this occasionally. It has the benefit of being easy to find!

Smell - Mild wheat notes with slightest grassy hops. Not very exciting.    Taste - Overall a generic sweetness cut with a strange tang and ending with a very short, very mild grassy bitterness. There are flavors, but they aren't what I'd call enjoyable.    Feel - Thin body and high carbonation. Drinks a bit rough. Very burpy and almost painful.    Overall - Not very good, definitely seems like the gateway from macro beers to craft beers.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.25 Served from tap into a wheat beer glass at Mickey Spillane's in Eastchester, NY.  A: Pours a cloudy, rather orange color with only a short lived white head and spotty lacing.  S: Aromas of oranges, honeysuckle, and maybe a touch of cloves/cardamom.  T: Flavor more banana, cloves, and spice, but definitely a troubling butteriness. Orange note present, but much less evident than in nose. Light, hard to appreciate bitterness.  M: Light to medium bodied with serious, persistent effervescence. Almost pulpy.  O: Looks delicious on the commercial, but, unlike it, the head did not make it from tap to table. Smell is largely disconnect from taste. Always concerned about the butteriness which I generally do not appreciate. Could be a function of being served on tap. Will update, should it prove different in subsequent tasting (from a bottle). Orange garnish probably a good idea.

Cold, refreshing, and great taste.

Barely a hint of malt.    Taste: Bready malt with a bit of orange on the back end. The orange is a lot stronger in the smell than the flavor. Virtually no hop bitterness or taste.    Mouthfeel: Highly carbonated, but fairly thick.    Overall: Easily drinkable, though the smell writes a check the taste can't cash.

It's more mainstream these days and less sofisticated than other fancy brews, but nonetheless it is a solid choice IMO. Nice malty wheat flavor. Slightly sweeter with a suggested orange slice.

look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 I think as far as the cheaper end of the “quality but still affordable” beers, blue moon gets an unfair bad wrap. It does have a nice body to it, and as far as its blend of citrus it makes a strong case for its taste as well. It’s not the most eye opening beer on the market but it’s a great beer to get a big case of to share with your friends at the beach or the pool. Way better than shock top in my opinion, and no they are not the same.

Smell: Very malty, bread-like  Taste: Strong malt taste, with citrus taste as it warms. Aftertaste is bread-like, like the smell.  Feel: Light and crisp, goes down easy.  Overall a decent beer. Taste slightly leaves something to be desired, but the rest is pretty quality.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5 12oz bottle bb May 14, 2018 poured into a wheat beer glass at fridge temp 5.4% ABV. The beer pours barely hazy orange yellow with quickly fading off white head. Just a pencil lead ring of head and no lacing after two minutes. The aroma is faint and brings a little wheat and orange. The taste is mild wheat, a touch of orange and a little sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sharply carbonated and undry in the finish. I find a little flawed stickiness in the finish that is reminiscent of a poorly lagered AAL. It is nicely masked by the wheat and orange. Overall, average. The high carbonation level and aftertaste are my biggest faults.

Aroma is pale, wheat, and biscuit malts, with a squeeze of orange. Flavor profile is orange and lemon zest, with biscuit and pale malts. Nice smoothness between the malts and citrus. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. Overall, a straightforward, easy-sipper. The flavor and aroma come off as slightly artificial and harsh, but otherwise smooth.     Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.

Aroma of pungent cereals, light coriander seed notes and lemon grass, clean aroma. Flavor is biscuit malts with coriander-spicy balance, fair bittering - goes to spicy, lightly bitter dry finish. Dusty biscuit malt character, coriander not overpowering, dry, refreshing but satisfying - decent enough witbier, not over the top - I was surprised this came from Molsons.

It's not really true to style, but it's a decent beer.

Smell is sweeter biscuit/wheat malt, light spice, a bit grainy.     Taste is similar - sweeter than most wit style beers, neutral yeast byproducts, more herbal spice character of light coriander and then some orange peel.     Mouthfeel is moderate with crisper carbonation than some wits.     Overall as most indicate a better than you may think beer, but still not really true to wit style as the yeast character is subdued.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 The "go to" it seems for just about everyone who aren't into microbrews or typical macrobrews (Bud, Coors, etc). I like it too. Crisp, clean, subtle flavors. Too much carbonation. I remember it as being better a few years ago, who knows. I'd get it more often if it were cheaper. I can't justify paying around $11 for a macro brew six-pack when I can pick up a pack of just about any, usually better craft beer for the same price; and possibly support a small or local business at the same time. Although I will admit I crave Blue Moon everyone once in a great while.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 L -- Pours a hazed golden body with a three-finger white head produced with moderate pour. Surprisingly good retention and lacing given the brewer, but definitely not great.   S -- Sweet doughy malts, fruity yeast esters, slight ajunct bite, and a touch of lemon. Also getting this weird sour apple juice aroma  T -- Has a 40-like sweetness to it, which is tempered by an aggressive clove/pepper/cinnamon/nutmeg spiciness, lemon, and a hint of fruity yeastiness. Tastes very mass-produced, but its better than most of the mass-produced stuff out there

Very pleasant first taste: creamy, buttery and smooth. A very slight aftertaste of nettle tea in the background, slightly artificial. Fairly sweet. The initial flavour remains through the drink with some fruitiness coming through mildly, subtle cereal and perhaps sweet orange. Quite light-bodied. A little watery but also smooth. Pleasant.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 From Hipercor. In Teku glass. At lunch, with fried potatoes + eggs and turkey steaks. Watery with so much if the usual orange peel/coriander/spices mix of the style that unpleases and makes it feel artificial and slow drinking. Generates low soapy foam that dissipates quickly, and isnt proper for the style but plenty very coppery. Avg 1.99    28 April 2018. In Teku glass. New label. At lunch, after futsal match. With fried fries + eggs + nuggets. Not watery like the first time i had it and with the spicyness much more under control. The carbonation is a bit over the top, but fine stil

Light in body... finish is a bit sweet and sticky.    O: A generic wheat beer. Very generic, but as an intro to beers other than the 'bud light' and 'miller light' of the world it'll do. Flavorful enough for summer. A beer I've long since outgrown but can still drink in a pinch.

In fact, I would argue I'm not sure what a 'Belgian Style Wheat Beer' even is?    Anyhow, snobbery aside, appearance is a very full body, orange colour with little head.    Aroma is it's best feature, with a combination of spices and citrus.    Taste isn't too bad either to be honest, although the aftertaste is not my cup of tea, leaving a very heavy and dry wheaten film on the tongue.    It goes down reasonably well, and overall I guess it's not bad.    It's the best of a bad bunch on many supermarket shelves, and low class drinking establishments, but hey it's a beer when all said and done, and that requires at least one quaff!

Had my first one on tap at Perdido Resort in Orange Beach AL, poolside bar, in a plastic cup, with an orange slice. It was our anniversary getaway; live music playing in the background, ocean view on the horizon. It was a great experience. First time I had ever noticed a nice aroma coming from a beer. It was always Miller or Yuengling before this; that's all I knew. But this beer actually had some flavor, and I love the smell of coriander... Great memories.     I have since then found my happy place to be a full flavored DIPA such as Lagunitas Waldo, or a Stone Enjoy By, but I have to give props to the beer that pulled me out of the mainstream and into the craft scene. It was the Blue Moon.

I don't really like hoegaarden beer which has orange flavor, but Blue moon has better decent orange flavor, more creamy and smooth when you swallow it.    Definitely 5 stars for this beer.

Aroma - Concentrated orange, oats, grainy  Taste - Sweetish orange candy, soft graininess, biscuit, dry yeast, musty. Finishes sweet with lingering orange on the palate.  Feel - Light bodied, soft carbonation. Not very dry, but very drinkable.    Overall - A touch more bitterness would help balance the sweetness in my opinion. Like all Coors products it's easy drinking and has a fair price. Great beer to pair with food.

look: 3.25 | smell: 2 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 Appearance: A cloudy golden orange beer with a quickly dissipating soapy head.     smell: Biscuity, bakers flour notes.. and a very muted scent of tangerine peel.     Taste: A sweet and creamy beer with mild notes of wheaty biscuits and rustic brown breads.     Mouthfeel: A mildly carbonated, thick and hearty beer.. very filling.     Final Thoughts:  =============  In my opinion this beer is pretty run of the mill as far as Witbiers go..    The flavour profiles and aroma of the beer are just a little too muted in comparison to other Witbiers I've tried.    But don't get me wrong.. this is still a very drinkable and pleasant beer.    Cheers!

I like these kinds of beer...... although as a change of pace it's nice to drink some really good hops ones like Zombie Dust and Two Hearted .......major cost factor on those though.

An easy beer that is enjoyable and has a good depth of flavor with medium body.

Cloudy golden orange in color, it tops with thick frothy white head that stays with pretty good retention before subsiding to a long-lasting bubble film atop and leaving minimal trail of lace.    In a nose, clove spice, coriander, orange peel, citrus, dry hay, sweet bubblegum and bready malt.    The taste is straightforward Wit with notes of clove spice, coriander, orange peel, citrus, hay, sweet and bready malt. Hop bitterness is typically very low.    Light to medium body with some good crisp and some lively carbonation, refreshing, finish is dry.    Decent and true to the style Wit, it is easy to drink but just typical one.

L: Beautiful, hazy golden orange with a thin foamy head. Mostly dies away after a minute, but a thin ring remains that leaves a ring of lacing down the glass. Looks like pulpy orange juice.    S: Orange peel. Sweet but watery orange flavor, like orange drink or Sunny D instead of actual orange juice. Hints of coriander, graininess and crackery malt.    T: Follows the nose. A little bitter orange peel sharpness, a lightly sweet orange flavor like watered down orange juice or orange drink. A bit bland, but refreshing. Crackery, grainy malts, with faint coriander spice. Finishes lightly dry, but the sweetness slowly builds on you after a couple. Sticky orange flavor remains in the mouth.     F: The lighter side of medium, but feels pillowy in the middle. A little watery near the finish, but it's not unpleasant.    O: Not too bad. Certainly not worthy of derision. One of Coors' best products, and I will still defend it in lieu of better beers. Yes, there are much better witbiers, but this is heads and shoulders above most BMC products.

look: 3 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 This might be a good beer to have once a blue moon. I first had this at an Applebees in a large pilsner glass...     Appearance - This beer has a very distinct cloudy yellow-orange to it. It resembles orange juice.     Smell - Very good notes of orange peel.     Taste - Orange peel... it is delightful and not too over-powering. I would rate it a five if the bitter bite was soon taken over by more sweetness. But overall, not a bad taste.     Mouthfeel - Very easy to guzzle! Kind of a watery feel to it, with a pleasant orange peel bite to cleverly hide any alcohol taste.     Overall - For a beer being ABV 5.4, it is really easy going. I have a feeling I will be having these more than just once a blue moon.

It is one of my favorite beers!

look: 3.75 | smell: 2 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 2.5 Bottle poured into a globe glass.    Look is golden orange like you took a light american lager and poured orange juice in it.. Unfiltered as a wheat beer should be.    Smell is too much orange for me , it doesn't get easier after a few, it gets worse.    Taste is actually pretty decent compared to the smell , not too orange of a flavor .. Little bit of sourness but not much hops bitterness.    Feel is full bodied, the mouth feel is one of the most positive aspects of this beer, it's not watery at all.    Overall I would drink one here and there but it's not sessionable to me so I wouldn't buy a 6-12 pack of this.

Quite bitter from the orange peel and the hop, which, unfortunately lingered around instead of the malt sweetness.     An okay interpretation of the classic Belgian style, but nothing special. Mediocre.

Its not my cup of tea, but I can see why it is one of the best selling beers out there. Not bitter, not hoppy, not heavy.

The coriander and orange peel come through in a very soapy, oily way. Faintest notion of caramel malt.    Taste: Bland, but not bad. Vague cinnamon spices upfront along with some notes of coriander and orange rind. A caramel malt sweetness creeps in mid palate with notes of yeast and bananas. Floral on the finish.    Feel: Mid-Heavy body with low carbonation. Very sweet. Dry and spicy.     Overall: I'm not the biggest fan of Blue Moon... I find the spices they use unpalatably abrasive and the sweet orange and malt combination to be cloying. I'll give it some credit, I can see how people could enjoy this, especially in the winter, but overall I find this beer mediocre at best.

Pretty much dominated by citrus overtone and goes down smoothly with little hop or bitter taste. I like a little stronger finishing to my beer but at least this one had a decent flavor to make up for it. Easy beer to drink. If you come across it in the stores or restaurant give it a whirl.

It's not bad, but it's not anything special or interesting either.    Taste: Loads of citrusy orange flavor. There is a wheaty malt taste too, but it's subtly in the background and more near the finish that anything else. The orange is the main flavor here.    Feel: A pretty refreshing, crisp beer. Not dry at all. A good amount of carbonation, which I usually don't like, but it works for this particular beer.    Overall: This is usually my go-to beer if I need something that will be widely available or if I'm out at a restaurant that doesn't have a huge beer selection. This beer is usually on the menu, and it's a reliable for those purposes. Otherwise, I wouldn't drink this very much given a larger selection of brews.

Taste: Citrus, orange, malt, coriander, goes down really easily    Feel: Very refreshing for a 5,4% but you taste the adjunct at the end, but after a minute you taste back the citrus notes.    So overall would I recomend it ? For sure, this is my go to beer. I would pick this over bud or coors.

This bottle had no head and what little white head it had it disappeared very quickly but does have a ring of fast rising bubbles from the carbonation. Never noticed this before but I smelled alcohol. I get a big whiff of orange, citrus, spice, and wheat and sort of an onion like smell. The beer has an average finish and carbonation level. It also felt a little sticky. The beer taste of a orange and citrus flavor and a strong wheat flavor. No real bitterness or noticeable hops and a slight sweetness.

I challenge any Wit-lover to taste-test Blue Moon against three or four other bottled Wits and tell me it's not right up there. Yes, some Wits on tap, brewed on-site, can be fresher and zestier, but how many of us live within easy distance of those fine establishments. For those of us who have to spend most of their time actually at work rather than chasing down the latest seasonal, a glass of Blue Moon from the fridge is not a bad deal. Good color in the glass, decent aroma, very drinkable. Thank you Coors for making a good Wit accessible to the common man.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 7/11/2016. Pours very hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Good appearance. Aromas of lemon, orange peel, pear, apple, coriander, clove, light banana/bubblegum, wheat, biscuit, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant around with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and bready malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, orange peel, pear, apple, coriander, clove, light banana/bubblegum, wheat, biscuit, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal herbal/spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange, pear, apple, coriander, wheat, biscuit, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and bready malt flavors; with a good malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.4%. Overall this is a good witbier. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and bready malt flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.

look: 2.75 | smell: 1.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3 I always find it hard to give a rating to a beer's appearance. I don't consider any appearance to be wrong or right or more appealing. Lace and head are thin. Color and clarity is a VERY cloudy yellow. Does that matter? no. Moving on...    Smell's like crap. Not that it smells especially foul or not beery, but the smell is weak, bland, and nothing tasty or particularly appealing. Smells mostly like typical cheap beer. It actually detracts from the drinking experience to have no nice smell. To some people it might SIGNIFICANTLY detract from their impressions of this beer. Did I get a bad can?    Tastes like nothing special. Maybe like a Shock Top Belgian White. Typical wheat beer taste and typical(?) mass-produced(?) belgian taste. Not [i]bad[/i], but nothing special or nice. Nothing remarkable except I suppose a fair bit of citrus. I guess there's the coriander or spice too, but frankly I didn't really notice either the spice nor the cirtus without looking for it, since it wasn't very strong, and is very typical to have for the style. No significant/special hops taste; the malt taste isn't anything great either. Has a mild doughy aftertaste, that is very mild, and not unpleasant.    Texture is nice. Not to overly carbonated or anything. This is one thing that was done well if you ask me.    Frankly, I'm surprised that this has such a high rating. Aside from radlers, I typically rate beers a bit higher or significantly higher than their average rating, but not this one. Around 80 isn't an ESPECIALLY good rating, but it's still a solid "above simply good", and I disagree with that. It's good; It's DECENT. I didn't especially care for it though, despite my liking of Belgians and wheats. There are probably better options for most people, even on somewhat of a budget if you're willing to pay a small bit more.    I'm wondering if I got a bad beer [can], because other people are noting a more pleasant smell, and stronger taste.   
look: 4 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3 I know this beer is quite popular, but this was the first time I had ever tried it.  12 ounce bottle poured into a 16 ounce beer glass. The beer pours with very little head. It is a foggy golden yellow color. The visual appearance is of this beer is pretty nice overall. The smell of this beer is too mild in my opinion. I detect sweet fruity citrus aromas more than anything. There is an extremely faint hops aroma. I typically do not enjoy beers that smell this fruity. Though I will say this beer does have it's own distinct smell to it. The beer tastes alright. The flavors I taste are quite mild for this style of beer. I tastes of sweet citrus, hops, and malt. But the taste is overly fruity. There is also a fruity aftertaste that I'm not fond of. The feel of this beer is nice. It has a light, smooth, foamy feel to it.    Overall, I don't see why this beer is as popular as at is. It has an overly fruity taste to it. If your are looking for a witbier, then you can do a lot better than Blue Moon without spending a whole lot more money. I would not recommend this beer, unless you enjoy extremely fruity smelling and tasting beers.    Cheers

Color is hazy apricot with an lightly off-white head. Thick head formed, but lacing did not seem too durable. Attractive at first pour. Nose was a bit plain, mild light malts and a hint of fruitiness. Taste was balanced and refreshing but did not seem very yeasty for a witbier (Belgian wheat beer). Some of the body and complexity seemed to be absent that I expect in that style, and especially any of the darker spices and yeast tones. There were yeasty and fruity flavors, though, and it was enjoyable, just a bit light for the style. Mouthfeel somewhat sudsy but nothing exceptional. The orange flavor often associated with this beer was not too strong and blended well.

Look is a bit orange definitely different than what im used to.    Smell is sweet and citrusy.    Taste is definitely the best part of this brew, sweet & citrusy, as if it was one of thise specialty seasonal beers. I enjoy it its different but if u want a usual American beer this isnt ir.    Feel is carbonated but not overly so goes down smooth.  Overall its not bad though if its your first time youll be a bit surprised its good but a bit of an acquired taste. I'd definitely reccomend to a crafter or an average beer drinker. Totally worth trying.

I usually have this in bottle or can, so further detail is generally missing.    S - Like many wheat beers, the nose is of sour grain. This is coupled with slightly more off notes, particularly when I have this in bottles. Cans are usually better, just grain, with slight sourness.    T - A pleasant bready note, heavy on the grain, with a light bitterness in the close.    M - Pretty light and crisp. No drying or spikes in the close.    O - Nothing wrong here, besides some skunk in the nose sometimes. The flavors, while far from spectacular, are perfectly adequate, and drinkable. An acceptable choice when BMC is the only option.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 A: A hazy, full orange color. With a decent-sized frothy head.  S: Light smells of wheat and coriander. Pretty strong orange smell.  T: Kind of a softly sweet taste. Tastes of sweet and refreshing oranges. Very subdued hints of wheat and coriander in the mix.  M: Easily a session beer with mild carbonation.  O: Overall, I really enjoy this beer. It's a great purchase for someone looking for something sweet or slightly fruity. It's easy drinking material, and easily available. Not sold for the price of a craft beer, but with almost similar quality. I would highly recommend this to someone who wants to get into Witbiers and for someone who wants a better Walmart beer.

Smell has aromas of wheat, coriander, pepper and hints of subdued citrus and orange.    Taste is subdued. Wheat comes through with some notes of spice and orange. Overall rather bland and muted.    Feel has medium carbonation, pretty drinkable.     Overall a poor example of a witbier, rather bland, nothing to drink with so many better offerings out there.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Light hazy yellow color with little white cap and even less lacing.    Aroma of orange and coriander with some slight hop spice.    Taste is refreshingly smooth and light with the orange, coriander and hops dancing all around with grain bill taking center stage. Oddly, the grain body is there as a core but doesn't have any speaking lines.    Light medium rounded texture balanced with carbonation.    Overall I can see why this is so popular. Mild, very agreeable, lightly spiced flavors that appear natural. Flavoring a brew with orange isn't hard but avoiding hints of artificiality is and this one pulls it off with panache.

I've had this beer enough times in my life that I know what to expect and what to say about it. I will never forget the spring of 2013 and the "Keg That Would Not Die" which is another story for another time. This beer is okay enough to me that I don't get bent out of shape if someone offers me one. There are better beers, that much can be said right off the bat, but Blue Moon Belgian White is a good, average, standby beer with a slight bit of character and general appeal. I don't drink it out of habit, but when I do have it I feel okay about the proposition.     A: slightly murky copper-gold with a finger of sudsy head that dissipates in a couple of minutes. Leave pretty good scum of foam on top of the glass as it dissipates, but the head itself is fairly underwhelming. As the glass empties, the suds pretty much disappear save for a ring around the edge of the glass.     S: lots and lots of orange. Bready. Sweet. Spicy/herbal smell that I attribute somewhat to yeast but mostly to coriander and maybe grains of paradise or something similar. Not a huge, sinus filling smell, so don't waste time trying to get down all the different nuances.     T: again with the oranges. If on tap I actually do like this with a slice of orange, but it is not necessary and I get why people don't care for it. Still very bready, pretty much like a slice of white bread in a glass, but it has just enough flavor to be interesting. Still spicy, though it complements decently. Hops are pretty much an afterthought. If it weren't so sweet then they'd come through a bit better.     M: a little bit too foamy and heavy for my taste, but it's not that bad. I wish it were a little bit drier. Not quite crisp and clean enough to be a refreshing hot weather drink.     I don't have much else to say. If you really want a witbier then go spend your money on something else, MillerCoors is rich enough. If you want something that tastes okay, won't break the bank, or are trying to introduce yourself or someone else into the world of beer outside of the Bud 24 pack, then this isn't a bad place to start.    To good health and good beer.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 L: Very cloudy orange gold. 1cm head that went away pretty quick.    S: Smells like a Hefeweizen plus the spices and orange. These are subtle, making it interesting and appealing.    T: Again, a Hefeweizen with the freshness of the orange+coriander. The aftertaste is bitter enough to notice it. It does have a flavor that reminds me of oats.    F: Very subtle carbonation. It is good but maybe too subtle. It feels creamy and fresh.    Overall, and interesting beer. I will definitely grab another one soon.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 Yawn. I really hate when a brewer just scoops up the name of a style and cooks up something that resembles that style in passing. Like this. A vague effort, drinkable, but uninspired. Sorta wheaty. Sorta yeasty. Sorta spicy. Meh. Won't hurt you, but won't thrill you either. Zzzzzz.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 The appearance is a cloudy orange, which is common for this style and the head is somewhat soapy. As far as aroma, citrus rules them all so I leave out the orange that is practically always served with this beer. I wish I could get more flavors out of it without the citrus overpowering it so much. Overall, a pretty refreshing beer that I find myself enjoying fairly often.   
look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 Appearance--Part of what keeps me coming back to this as a "standard bar tap" selection is the attractive color of this beer--though it is somewhat "off" compared to others of the style. Pours somewhere between an amber and a golden color. It has a nice solid head that maintains well throughout the drink.    Smell--Aggressive citrus notes from the outset--and not much else. The smell is a tipoff of the general lack of complexity of this Belgian white.    Taste--See comment above regarding aroma. Citrus and more citrus. I would pass on the orange that the barkeep will invariably put in the glass as a matter of course if you don't say something in advance. The label and advertising talk about coriander and other ingredients, but the orange zest overwhelms all of them. This is not a nuanced Belgian white, which isn't unexepcted for a "for the masses" selection that is ubiquitous on restaurant and bar taps. However, when you're having a bite in a joint that offers Budweiser, Miller Lite, and Coors Lite as the other "options," it's a vastly superior choice. It's also a nice "opening" beer because it's pretty light, and is easy to drink.    Feel--Nice carbonation, but that's about the only remarkable sensation it brings to the party.    Overall--I remember when this beer first started showing up in restaurants years ago, and at the time, it was treated like a "premium" offering because it was before other better offerings have proliferated as craft beers have exploded. However, I keep coming back to it, because it was one of the first beers I tried two decades ago that was outside the "comfort zone" of the standard macro brews. I think this would still be a good beer for someone that has been drinking Budweiser, Miller, or other generics to step into a different style, though other Belgian whites that have crossed over into mass production, like Hoegaarden, would still be a better choice in that regard.

Light finish, short lingering sweet malts and soft spices. Okay freshness, a bit flat. Faint flavors and bland. Not a good witbier, overall the quality is mediocre.

The existence of 'Rickard's White' in Canada (which has always been, quite literally, nothing more than re-labelled Blue Moon) has previously presented a large disincentive for Molson-Coors to bother launching the Blue Moon label on this side of the border. But I suppose M-C has got to find some way to compete with all of that fruity Shock Top crap that has been diffusing into Canada over the past year, and this is merely the first step.    Pours foggy golden-yellow, with a full inch of frothy, bone white-coloured head floating atop. It dissipates continuously over the next couple of minutes, eventually leaving behind a wide, foamy collar accompanied by minimal lace. Cereal grains and wheaty sweetness on the nose, with notes of zesty orange peel and spicy coriander. Kind of a weird sweaty armpit vibe, too.    Not too appealing. More cereal grain and gritty wheat flavour; the adjuncts help cover things up, but you can tell the base beer is mediocre and cheap. Orange peel and lemon zest make up the latter half of the sip, with subtle coriander spice and muddled flavours of yeast and apricot finishing things up. Light-medium body, with moderate carbonation levels - lower than I was expecting, but still enough to produce a relatively crisp mouthfeel. Refreshing when cold, I suppose, but if that's all I'm seeking then I'd rather save myself some money and just buy a regular pale lager.     Final Grade: 2.88, a forgettable C grade. Nope. No thanks. I realize that Blue Moon as a brand has done some good work as a gateway craft beer, but the beer itself doesn't do much for me at all. Unless they opt to retire the old Rickard's White brand, I have no reason to believe that Belgian Moon's presence in Canada is anything more than a half-assed attempt by Molson-Coors to gobble up some shelf space so that the competition can't have it. At best, it's a tolerable corporate witbier; one that Canadians who are familiar with the Rickard's portfolio can handily skip.

The only difference I have seen, was that there is no lees or very little at the bottom of the bottle.    This one will become really fast one of my favorite and will probably compete with the Rickard's white.    The color is a rich golden yellow with less deposit than in the Rickard's white. They probably filter this beer a little bit more.     On my beer can I can't find anywhere saying blue moon, so I assume I have the right one to describe.     5.4% ABV, the IBU (international beer bitterness) is very low, and the SRM (Standard reference Method) is about 5 to 6. The can is 473 ml for 3.65 $.    This beer will become one of my many favorite beer.

Best paired with any pork dishes, especially those Chinese take out. One of the best Belgian White Ale I've ever tasted.

This beer made we want to explore the world of craft beer that I indulge in today, so thank you Blue Moon and Coors Brewing. I may not consider you a "great beer" now, but you served your purpose as my "gateway beer!"

Look: Settles a hazy, soft orange color, with a half finger sized head of light tan foam which settles into nothing.    Smell: Strong wheat and bread on the nose, with some orange peel and citrus backing it.    Feel: Heavy and thick feel, with a lot of carbonation.    Taste: Wheat and biscuit backbone throughout, with the citrus and orange peel emerging behind the heavy wheat.    Overall: First Witbier. Before I drank beer, I remember the commercial for this beer, and always thought it looked good. This isn't bad at all, but mediocre in my opinion. Feels heavy, and nothing really stands out about it.

The taste isn't as wheaty as other witbiers I've had, and seems to be quite a bit weaker than the smell. The feel is light, crisp, and smooth with medium carbonation.

Taste was a wheat bread, biscuit taste mixed with citrus notes and some spices like coriander coming through in the background.    Mouth feel was leaning toward medium with a nice wet finish.    Overall this was a good wit that placed above others and below others for me. That being said I would place this on a regular order list and I am very happy with another nice offering from the Coors Brewing Company.

A- Opens well and pours a 1" high white head that lasts for nearly 4mins before film out. Medium gold colour and unfiltered    S- Nice coriander. Some malt.    T- Thin. Missing that Belgium style white flavor completely. Just a shill of a wheat brew. Guess the proper ingredients in the proper proportions are too expensive for this mass producer. This must be what happens when the bean counters get too involved in a brewery.    M- Thin and watery    O- Ok at best. Just not even the same ball park as a Blanche De Chambly or Hoegaarden. It must be the mass producing philosophy keeping this one down...... profit, profit, profit, flavor be damned.    Food Pairing    This ok brew went ok with....... BBQ mild sausage with mild yellow mustard and fried sauerkraut.     Enjoy

The appearance is hazy as all get-out, but the bold (but artificially strong) orange peel on the nose and tongue, backed by sweet bready grains, is as easily enjoyable as anything. As insulting as it is to call this superficial beer Belgian in style, it's equally as insulting to dismiss it as a bad beer altogether.

However, it helped me learn about other Witbiers', so it's served its purpose.     Coors makes this, their beer is atrocious, but they have a diamond here in a sea of garbage.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Ah, Blue Moon Belgian White. The bridge to craft beer for many, myself included, that people love to hate. I wonder, if this exact same product was put out by Hill Farmstead or Russian River, would it have higher scores? I could care less that this is a mass-produced Coors product. It succeeds, as far as I'm concerned, as a mass-market wheat beer.    Pours an inviting cloudy orange, smell is very mild -- yeasty, wheaty, and citric. The taste is milky, smooth, orange-dominant, very mild and easy-drinking. Clean aftertaste. Creamy mouth-feel. Pretty clearly not at the level of Hoegaarden, Allagash, or St. Bernardus, but better than a lot of small-batch American wits I've tried.    A solid choice when your options are limited. On tap practically everywhere and better than any American adjunct lager.

Belgian White is definitely not a quality beer   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 A hazy golden color, with a almost non-existent head, with below average lacing.     Smells of wheat, with notes of citrus and overall sweetness.     Taste is similar to smell. Although, I also detected bananas and various subtle spices, most prominently, coriander.     Mouthfeel is light and very drinkable. Carbonation is high, yet does not detract from the taste.     Yeah, yeah. I know this is a big macro beer, and by extension, the scourge of the earth. Yet, this is very tolerable, despite its simplicity.     I understand why BA's might be skeptical over the big macros buying up small craft breweries, but I don't see any harm whatsoever in offshots such as Blue Moon who try to do something different, albeit perhaps not excellently so.

Overall, it's not a terrible beer. It was refreshing for a poolside sip, but I certainly won't go out of my way to track it down again!

Since then, I've had much better and much worse. My most recent experience: Decent appearance, a hazy yellowish color with a small head that dissipated quickly and didn't leave any lacing. Smell and taste are both mostly wheaty with a faint orangeness. Pretty thin feel. Overall, it's kind of a weak, mild beer that's lacking in flavor, but not so bad I'll refuse to drink it. I wish they would embrace the citrus and add more of an orange or lemon flavor.
