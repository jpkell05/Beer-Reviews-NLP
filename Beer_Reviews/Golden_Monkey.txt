look: 3 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 I bought this beer in a pick six . On first sip the banana is right there. As it goes along the other spices kick in and almost hide the whopping 9.5 ABV, but not quite. Not really a bad beer, but I'm sure would not have too many of these at once.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Pours mostly golden with a nice off-white head but not much retention. A sharp strong aroma, some spice pineapple, and fruit, but also a whiff of acetone and booze. I love the flavor, but I am partial to this style. Banana bread, ginger, bourbon, it’s all in there. Funky stuff. Can vary a bit from bottle to bottle and when warmer, can be quite boozy. I appreciate the range of experience you have with this beer. One of my favs.

The beer is very spice-forward, but not overwhelmingly so, with classic notes of banana, coriander, and clove. The Belgian yeast is spot-on and this beer is dangerously drinkable at 9.5%. My only disappointment was that the head disappeared quickly.

Aroma is bread, yeasty and acidic with esters of apple, pear and slightly phenolic. Taste is pale malt, bread, yeast esters of apple, peach and pear; there is a hint of grape, honey and mineral with a citrus hoppy bite and bitterness. It is peppery throughout. Bitterness deepens in the astringent aftertaste.

The beer pours bright golden amber in color with off white head. The head recedes to a few bubbles and a thin ring leaving a few spots of lacing. The aroma is spicy and yeasty with a hint of alcohol. The taste is semisweet clovey banana with some nice pils malt in the middle before a drying medium bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated with a slightly prickly feel on the tongue. Overall, good. This doesn't seem as cohesive as some higher rated examples, but doesn't seem as far off as the numbers would indicate.

Not as good as Allagash's Tripel (that is amazing) but for the money spent this is enjoyable. What's amazing to me is how well the 9.5% abv is hidden for such a light beer. The mouthfeel is on the lighter/thinner side. But this beer packs quite a bit of flavor and it grows on you the more you sip it.    It is a great summer beer for sure. It's not that expensive either. I'd bring this to a summer party and feel like 1) I didn't spend a ton of money and 2) I brought a beer that most people could drink no problem.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Canned on date of 1/18/18 on the bottom of the can, 5.5 months since brewing.    Pours an almost clear golden in the glass with two fingers of dense white head. Nose starts off with a crisp mix of coriander and Belgian yeast. Digging further in to the aroma I get cooked peach, slight nutmeg, caramelized toasted walnut, super slight banana and some honey. At the very end of the nose, after warming up, I get a hint of vaporized alcohol. Taste starts off super sweet with a honeyed banana bread, quickly is followed up by the spices and ending with yeast + hops. Overwhelming flavors on first taste, almost off-putting, but rapidly mellows out after first contact. Medium body that I wasn't expecting from the almost crystal clear glass. High sweetness, low bitterness, medium-light drying. I don't detect any of the 9.5% ABV alcohol on taste, but you definitely get the warming of a nearly ten percent brew. If you're just getting in to craft beer, this would blow out your palette, but it's a great introductory brew for those getting in to Tripels. I haven't had one of these in a while, but I might have to start picking them up more often.

Alcohol is virtually undetectable, a rarity in a 9.5% beer. Overall a very tasty interpretation of the Belgian Tripel by an American brewery.

Sometimes, the "added spice" hits the spot, other times it feels like the beer would taste better without it. It's my go to beer at a place I frequent regularly. Unfortunately, most places only carry one or two beers in this style so I can't do a good taste test.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 This was the first Belgian Ale I ever liked. I had a few other examples, a couple dubbels, a tripel, a quadrupel (Ommegang's Three Philosophers; closest I've ever gotten to a drain pour--to be fair, it was early in my beer drinking days), nothing went over well with me. Had this from a keg at a party in Reston Virginia while visiting my cousin. He literally asked me if I wanted his when the host walked away; I'm sure to him it was basically a Three Philosophers, but I was loving it so I happily finished mine and adopted his.    L: 2.5 years later, it pours beautifully from a bottle into a goblet. Clear golden honey body, lots of lively streams of carbonation. No lacing to speak of, and the head retention is a bit lacking.    S: Lots of amyl acetate (Banana), spiced with clove, nutmeg and coriander, with notes of honey and molasses, mango, peach cobbler, and honeydew.    T: Having had a few more Belgian-style ales, I still think this is good, but it has too much artificial banana on the flavor, and the sweetness becomes a tad cloying after about half a beer. There is a pleasant spicy bite mid sip, and clove and coriander save the finish from being grossly sweet. Also, confirmed: I prefer the Sour Monkey to this original version.    F: Not bad, not bad. Pretty zingy for the style. Not too heavy.    O: It’s good, but not great. I have La Fin Du Monde in my cabinet. Pretty excited. Gonna be too busy to drink tomorrow, but I'm going to try/review it on Tuesday. I hope it blows this away.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Look: Deep gold with a big, foamy white head.    Smell: Malt, fruity citrus, and spice.    Taste: Yeasty tripel flavors, with spicy malt at the back. A noticeable warm alcoholic bite.    Mouthfeel: A little thin and carbonated, but still nice.    Overall: An excellent example of a Belgian trappist style from an American brewery, and one that's often easier to find than imported Belgian ones.

S: Aromas of cloves, lemon, and banana predominate the nose with a peppery note.  T: Sweet to semi-sweet and smooth. Flavors of cloves, honey, maybe a bit of banana and lemon blend nicely. Bitterness light relative to overall taste palate, allowing other flavors to come through. Drinks very cleanly.  M: Light to medium bodied with very consistent effervescence.  O: This is likely to best American produced Tripel I have had to date. Definitely in the same league as international offerings. While impressed by the number of ratings, the overall score seems a bit low. Could there be an issue with consistency/shelf life? I refrigerated mine when I purchased it. #production information

NOW it taste like bad banana bread or like banana Now or Later candy sorta of gross and leaves a really bad aftertaste in your mouth. We used to really like this beer but we’re very disappointed in the new taste.    What ever they changed is not good.    Victory Brewery bring back the old Golden Monkey.

It is the standard by which I measure all other beer. No matter what mood I am in a Golden Monkey brightens me up. The only downside to this beer, and I mean only, is that due to it’s ABV it is not an all day bbq drinker. This is a low volume Gem. Great with a prime rib. Great as a sipper. But not an all day backyard chugger.

Picked it up at my local Kroger in a mix n match 6 pack...the high ABV caught my eye and it was only 1.49..not a fan of trippels by any means but this one is very smooth and mild for the style. At 9.5% ABV i can't taste the booze at all and you could definitely get carried away with this one.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 12oz bottle, bottled on Sept 22, 2017. Served in a Duvel tulip glass.    Appearance: Mostly clear golden yellow with just a bit of very finely dispersed sediment if you look closely when held up to the light. Big thick white head slowly died back with persistent thick sheets and strands of lacing.     Smell: Yeasty, floral, herbal, leafy, with a bit of a whiff of noble hops.     Taste: Leafy bitterness throughout with some noble hop taste. Some fruity esters from the Belgian yeast scattered throughout. There may be some other spices in this, including Grains of Paradise, which has a distinctive taste that I'm not fond of and I think I'm detecting it here. Complex taste. The malt is somewhat muted and the sweetness for me shows up at the finish. Odd.     Mouthfeel: Prickly carbonation with some lingering spiciness on the tongue. Powdery and soft mouthfeel. Some stickiness on the teeth.     Overall / Drinkability: A very different Tripel than I've had before, but hits the style well, and is a good one to sip and savor and try to pull out all the flavors. I think the only reason I didn't enjoy it more was the Grains of Paradise - if that's what I'm tasting at the finish (it may be given the cryptic "Exotic Spice from the East" comment below). One is enough for me per evening. This much flavor might be better to pair with food rather than drinking it separately.

Might well fool you into drinking too fast.    Update: I have grown super fond of this brew, it's become my go to when our local distributer isn't pulling it off the shelf.

It is topped with an inch of off white head that leaves no lacing.     The smell is banana and clove right away. I also get some spiced pear.    The taste is more of the spiced pear. I get hints of banana. It has a clean finish.    Velvety smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied    I don't drink a lot of tripels. This one is well done. It tastes great and is easy to drink.

The Belgian yeast, a good malt backbone and special spices combine to produce an initially sweet taste, But the finish is beautifully dry. This is a great warming beer ( which actually gets better as it warms), designed to be savored rather than slammed as the chilly nights begin to appear with regularity. At 9.5%, it commands serious respect, but if you’re home with the fireplace blazing, there’s nothing wrong with a second— or even a third.

A slight alcohol astringency. Not a lot going on but the dominant flavors aren't as terrible as the reviews led me to believe. There aren't any off putting elements here - there's just not a lot going on, and not in the subtle sense.    This beer is 9.5% Wow. Probably the most subdued beer I've ever had at that percentage. This isn't really 9.5% is it?    Not bad. For a beer of this ABV it's abnormally mellow.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Unleash the Monkey! Pours a hazy honey golden color with a very thin white head. Lots of carbonation bubbles on the side of the glass.    Smells almost like Mom's homemade banana bread. Smell seems to have a bit of alcohol smell in the background.    Taste has some peppery notes. Also picking up some of that banana bread I was getting on the nose.    Mouth leans towards a bit of a heavy mouth with some stickiness in the mouth. On the back end however the beer does finish lighter than the mouth. Picking up some alcohol warming on the back end.    I really like what Victory has come up with in Golden Monkey. I understand there are several variations of this which makes me curious about the Monkey. That is so cool to see a bottled on date (and time!) stamped clearly on the bottle. I have let this one sit and it is running just over four month's old. I do not see that as a problem with a 9.5% ABV. I did have one several months ago when I first purchased the four pack. That one was only about one month old. Really not telling a lot of difference. This really is a finely crafted and tasty beer.   
look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 overall a decent American take on a Belgian tripel. It appears light golden straw like in color with a little bit of cloudiness with sediment on the bottom. Fairly weak smell of bready floral notes with some of that Belgian yeast smell coming through. Fairly smooth and creamy that is semi heavy. It starts with some hop flavor that kinda gets a little spicy then some of the bready malts hit followed by some Belgian type yeast. Overall one of the better American tripels but compared to the actually Belgian style beers and even some of Canada's tripels. But it is a good starter tripel if you've never had one before, but just realize there are so many more complex tripels out there

A biscuit malt backbone with slight alcohol warmth, as well as hay/straw. Finishes dangerously dry with clove/white pepper notes.

This is a hard to get this genre of ale to get just right. It would probably taste better at the brewery tap, to be honest. Mine was from a glass, poured at 41F from a glass. It is a little bit unsubtle for a saison. It has a narrow range of flavor, although enjoyable enough. It tastes a bit like oxidized honey and old caramel, but does have a good hint of the typical saison. Note to brewer: I think Victory have a great product that they could improve on.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I am in the midst of a VT CANQuest (tm) excursion, but having sipped upon sunshine, I decided to move away from AIPAs & DIPAs for the moment & delve into one of the CANs taking up space in my reefer. I flash back to the early days of The CANQuest, c. 2004/2005. I was bending Bill Covaleski's ear re. putting Victory's beers in CANs for the umpteenth time. I had been heartened as Tom Kehoe of Yards assured me that he was into the idea, but numerous factors came into play (sidebar: the new Yards facility WILL have a CANning line) & so I felt emboldened. Bill, who is usually one of the most even-keeled, long-tempered brewers that I know, suddenly wheeled & roared, "WOODY, STOP IT WITH THE CANS! VICTORY BEERS WILL BE IN CANS WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER! NOT ANOTHER WORD, UNDERSTOOD?!?" Upon leaving, I rang up my broker & secured the sole proprietorship on any and all cold-weather gear sold in Hades. Today, I am a rich man, while Bro. Bill is merely sheepish. BTW, he really likes when I recount that tale!    From the CAN: "    I Crack!ed open the CAN to loud applause from beneath my chair. I guess that the residents of H-E-double-toothpick are likewise glad to see Victory beers in CANtained aluminum cylinders! I was greeted by a brimful CAN that immediately began foaming through the vent in an instance of Covaleski's Revenge. I allowed it to settle before performing a gentle Glug which was enough to satiate us all. I watched as it formed a finger of dense, foamy, bone-white head of its own accord & then evinced great retention. Color was a gorgeous Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 -5), like liquid sunshine of which I was about to take a sip, at least I was until the arrival of The Gelt Gang - Croesus, Midas & Mammon, all wanting some Golden goodness of their own. Nose had a pronounced spiciness, but not the usual Pumpkin/Hallowe'en/Holiday spices. No, instead, this was coriander, black pepper, star anise & dried orange peel! Oh my. Mouthfeel was full, thick & creamy as though a dollop had been ladled onto my tongue by a trollop. The taste was wonderfully spicy, very peppery, but with a light citrusiness & a dry mustiness that could only have been borne of Belgian yeast.     This was evocative of our initial foray to the then-nascent brewpub in Downingtown, via train from Lancaster. It seemed like a long walk from the train station at the time, but now, il n'est pas rien. As we were leaving, a fellow guest offered to give us a ride up Lancaster Avenue to the train station & thus unburdened, we purchased a growler of Golden Monkey which we passed around like a jug of hooch on the train. Upon debarking in Lancaster, we had to be poured off of the train!     The finish was spicy, yeasty & very dry. I kept getting intense peppery notes, even well after the swallow.     If you like white wine & CANnot find it in a CAN, I humbly offer this up as a (possibly) suitable substitute. Its presence in a CAN means that you CAN put it next to your boyfriend's CANs of TenFidy in the cooler as you head to the beach, never to be heard from again as the surf gently pulls your slumbering bodies out to sea.

The appearance was a soft semi-cloudy sort of bronze/copper color with a finger's worth of white foamy head that swiftly dissipated. Lace seemed to sparkle a bit but becomes strewn about in a speckled sort of way.  The aroma had some "iced apples" up front, somewhat Granny Smith-like with a touch of coriander, delicate Belgian sugars, sly Belgian bready/yeastiness, light banana flesh, and ended with a little bit of clove.  The flavor was a superb blend of sweet to spicy Belgian malts to spices and gently weaving into themselves to create a refined aftertaste.  The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a shining absorbent carbonation feeling right on into the ABV eloquently.   Overall, pretty nice Belgian Tripel brewed by an American brewer. No wonder I've come back to this so many times in life.

The few Belgian tripels I've had all have a distinct smell, almost champagne like. This is no exception. Astounding beer.  T: Absolutely love it. See the smell section. They have done a superb job making a 9.5% beer this great. Better not plan on driving. This goes down like nothing and at this percentage, it's gonna sneak up on you big time. On the exhale really tasting flowers and potpourri.  F: watery and wet. Thin. It is swallowed quickly and easily. As if it was Bud Light. No thickness here, and that is a positive in my book.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Poured from a 12oz bottle with a bottled on date of 3/7/17; into a Duvel tulip.

Taste - lemon sweetness, spiciness from the coriander and faint trace of booze, but I find it to really be hidden!  Feel - medium body, sweet but not overly so and a gentle spice hides the booze quite well!  Overall - I rather enjoy this beer and don't really understand some of the overly negative reviews I've read. Certainly not as good as other Tripel's, but it's still pretty good.

Ample, streaming carbonation. Not much in the way of lacing. Little retention.    S: right off the bat loads of bubble gum esters and a little ripe banana. Sweet, candied malt. Nothing in the way of citrus, which I would sort of expect.    T: bright and slightly tart arrival transitions to a crisp and crackery middle that shows off those medicinal phenols. Bubble gum and clove. A little alcohol there as it transitions to the finish, which is slightly medicinal, and has a restrained sweetness. Some lingering phenols and a little alcohol.    M: solidly midweight and very highly carbonated; slick finish but not excessively so. Doesn't really have the "creamy" texture I was expecting or hoping for.    O: kind of disappointed, to tell you the truth. La fin du Monde was my first tripel, and even now when I have it I love it. I've only had maybe four tripels, but this is borderline difficult to drink. I like this less than the tripel with black peppercorns I once had. Don't think I'd buy again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Great golden body, some particles floating about, fluffy, effervescent white head, plenty of fine streams of bubbles rising along the glass, no lace noticed. The nose offers, light malts reminiscent of pilsner, wheat, mild tropical fruits, and plenty of yeast. There's also mild spices, white pepper being the most prominent. The flavor is yeasty, like bread, sourdough, mild chalkiness, and pepper, with all the other fruit and malt flavors hiding behind this. It's More refreshing than those main flavors I mentioned would indicate. Mango, pineapple, both slightly chemically, find their way through the middle. Body is both light and drinkable, yet complete and satisfyingly full.  This was a really good beer. It may have lacked the full depth and complexity of the real Belgians, which, living in the U.S. I would not know, but it still delivered good balance and variety of flavors. Very complex, mature, tasty, balanced, well-directed, and overall an enjoyable brew.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 5 Now hear me out.    Is this a Trippel-style American beer for Trippel aficionados? Absolutely not. There is a lot wrong with this beer and there is certainly a lot more out there that's better for the same price. But there's more to it.    L: Pours hazy gold with a substantial white head. Head diminishes quickly to thin lacing.     S: Here's where it starts to go wrong. Bananas, cinnamon, clove, barley (?), sugar, allspice all evident. As is alcohol. My god, does this beer smell its 9.5% ABV. It's telling when it can make a Postgrad student with a foie gras liver's nosehairs curl.    T: Same as the nose, to its detriment. Bananas, allspice, malt and sugar sweetness forward, with substantial alcohol ester close behind.     F: Fairly light-bodied for a trippel-style and smooth on the first pull but becomes sharper as the alcohol kicks in. Not unpleasant by any means but still not what a trippel-style ought to be.    Overall: I actually gave Golden Monkey a 5/5 overall for a simple reason: it's an excellent gateway ale. For those whose only experience with beer are mass-produced lagers, ales (and Belgian-style ales in particular) can seem a tad intimidating. Golden Monkey is an excellent introduction to the world of Belgian-style ales before moving on to better things. While La Fin Du Monde will always remain my trippel-style of choice, Golden Monkey does hold a special place in my heart.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Canned on 3/3/17, enjoyed on 4/22/17.   I really enjoy this American tripel. Look is golden clear with clean white head, good carbonation. Aroma of lemon and belgian yeast. Lemon, coriander, and clove are the prominent flavors for me. There are more subtle hefe aromas and flavors mixed in that I can't call out just yet. Lots of sweetness throughout and warm alcohol on the finish. Some folks I've asked to try this get a burnt rubber/scotch aroma, others don't, depends on your palate I think. For me this is a great introduction to the style and I think this holds up as one of the better American belgian tripels that's widely distributed.

Like, too much.    Smell is sweetish grain and maybe a little bit of herbalness, but there's also a rubber scent that's moderately unpleasant. I can also pick out some alcohol, which I don't normally get on the nose.    The taste is way better than the nose. Dried banana is the main flavor I get. It's pretty mellow and not overly sweet. There's also a slight amount of cinnamon. It also has a bit of a breakfast cereal taste that's somewhere between Grape-Nuts and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Thankfully, the rubber went away, but I can still pick out the alcohol.    Carbonation is well integrated, and the thickness is medium for the type. The aftertaste matches the taste.

It is a nice amber in color with a fruity nose. Taste is just enough fruitiness to encourage you to sip it joyfully with a satisfying mouth feel. Overall I found it to be an enjoyable beer that I would buy whenever I caught it napping on the shelf.

Tastes a bit like a hefeweizen on steroids but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Not one of the great Tripels but a tasty brew nonetheless.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Appearance- Lives up to the name for sure. Pours a deep gold with a slight amber hue to it, with just an inch of head that lingers for around 5-10 minutes.     Aroma- Clove, coriander, and a certain peppery spice are at the forefront of this one, and come off quite strong, yet pleasant, even for this particular style. Slight hints of banana and bubblegum, with just a touch of alcohol lingering in the nose.    Taste- Very sweet, but just a step short of being cloying. The spices really pop with this one, and it follows the nose very well overall. Alcohol is much more well hidden than the smell might suggest, and I wouldn’t be able to guess this was 9.5% without knowing. There is plenty of heat here, but it’s from the insane spice presence, and kick from the Belgian yeast.    Mouthfeel- Medium to full bodied for a triple, bordering on sticky but not quite there. That’s a good thing, great, in fact, as I think they ride the line perfectly here. Not too thick, and not too watery, with just enough carbonation to combine with the kick from the spices/yeast to really bring it all together.    Overall- This is one of the first beers that I ever loved, and it stands as one of my favorite Tripels in existence, for all of the above reasons.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This Belgian tripel pours a light orange (tangerine) color with a medium foamy white head and a somewhat high amount of carbonation. The smell is fairly fruity with banana, pear, and apple notes. There are also noticeable spice notes, light florals, yeast, and a light alcohol scent as well. It’s a pleasant scent with fairly standard tripel character. The taste is significantly less standard in my opinion. For starters it’s much less fruity than the scent would have you believe with only mild offerings from the aforementioned fruits. The spices and yeast are much more prevalent and perhaps most surprisingly there is a fairly strong honey character that adds quite a bit of sweetness. The taste of alcohol is noticeable, but fairly mild, though it does produce quite a bit of warming in the aftertaste. The body is medium, maybe a little heavier than most tripels. The finish lacks a crisp semi-dryness that I’ve encountered with many other examples of the style, it is almost creamy. A unique take on a tripel. This isn’t typically one of my favorite Belgian beer styles and so I find it somewhat interesting though strict adherents to the style will no doubt be disappointed. It also lacks a bit of complexity compared to elite tripels.

The taste is like spoiled fruit, overripe bananas, cloves, coriander, white pepper and yeast with a bitter finish. This does not at all work for me. It is Belgian enough but the rotten fruit flavors and the giant snowflakes at the bottom of my glass were unpleasant.

T - Huge bitter up front from the hop, dry and sweet malt/grains, honey, bananas, lots of flowers, bitter earth, crisp water, slight citrus, a bit dank and that Belgian yeast sticks around.    M - medium plus body, nice balance, nice complexity, medium plus acidity, medium carbonation and a bitter sweet finish    D/O - despite how big and bitter this one is it is very clean, refreshing and quite easy going down. Aging seems as though it would do very little except tone down the bitter but not even sure of that. Still, well done, excellent and worth a go for sure. Probably awesome ok tap or even nitro.     Final thoughts - at nearly 10% ABV this one is for sharing with good friends or for a night cap. The $3-4 per bottle price is a bit high, but still worth a try.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Does a Tripel really need to end with a hoppy/bitter finish? Its potable, it is spicy. I had to rewrite my first review, because over time this tripel has become one of my more reliable purchases. It has a wonderful color, a sweet and spicy taste, and enough dry sizzle in the end to justify the price (which is quite affordable for a tripel brewed right here in the US).

Towards the end though, the alcohol taste really comes out, which is my only gripe.  F- A very thick, syrupy texture, which is fitting for the taste of it.

look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Not complex, but a highly drinkable sweet tripel.    Very pale and translucent - you could just about read a newspaper through the glass and the head doesn't stay around long. Smells is extremely sweet, like a sugar vapor is coming at you.    I would consider the spice angle to be rather mild overall. There's some spice at the front end, but it's more syrupy and floral or candy-like rather than a sharp spice flavor overall. This has no aftertaste at all, nor any sort of lingering booze trap where you can taste it a few hours later.    I'm also not sensing the alcohol taste that others are noting - it masks the 9.5% admirably. While I was sipping it, you could probably take more robust swigs with how mild it is in general. It reminds me quite a bit of Candi by Old Dominion Brewing Company, being almost the same exact approach and I doubt I would do particularly well trying to distinguish the two from one another.     Overall complexity was respectable, and I quite appreciate getting a 25 ounce bumper at Costco for $4.99 as well; not really a destination beer, but quite respectable and worth revisiting.

look: 3.75 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2 | overall: 2.25 I used to love it. Until around 2014 this really tasted and acted like a great trippel: the head didn't fall, it smelled great and tasted great too. I think they started using cheaper hops and yeast, and now I can barely tell it's a trippel, the carbonation is bigger, and it tastes more strongly like alcohol even though the alcohol content is about the same. Also, it just came out in . . . cans!? and seemed at the same time to take another downhill turn in quality. Too bad: I miss the version I used to get a couple of years ago.

look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 1.5 | feel: 1.5 | overall: 2 not sure how they call this a triple. Tastes more like a super spiced farmhouse.   L-pale yellow good head that dies quickly  S-smells of spice. Almost more like an ipa smell.  T-taste rich and strong Belgian hops. More like a farmhouse ale with a slight spice to it in till after then it burns like a shot of cheap whiskey.  F-smooth at first with a finish like burning shot of 151.  O-if it was hot and I chugged the whole beer probably ok. It is not in the category of any triple I have ever had.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 2 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 Not great on the nose. A bit phenolic and peppery.    Looks decent for a tripel but is a bit cloudy. Head falls fast    Hides alcohol fairly well but does not have the presence that I would cask tripe. Tastes like a phenolic, estery, overspiced heavy. It did cover the alcohol taste but not warmth. It's drinkable but not what I associate with Belgian tripel. Critically the taste is that of a lighter beer jacked on Kandi syrup or crystal malt and a yeast that barely managed to survive the fermentation. On the other hand it is very drinkable for the punch it packs.     Thin, not the heavy depth and clean alcohol feel I'd expect from a Belgian trip. Peppery aftertaste. Prickly, no sharp carbonation.    I would say this beer is mislabeled. I would not put this in the tripel category. As harsh as that sounds I am judging it against what I expected., this is something else. That something else I can't nail down as I have a pretty good buzz. Maybe a strained British no 2 but not a Belgian tripel.

Overall- This feels like what a belgium triple would taste like if it was made by Budwieser. Not awful, but can be much better. It feels like they went cheap on this one. With so many great tripels out there, I don't see myself getting this one again!!!!   
look: 2 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3 Had on tap. A one finger white creamy dense head with piss poor retention. The beer is golden in color with some straw color hues. The clarity is murky with some carbonation visible.     The beer presents with pepper, lemon, floral, caramel, bread, yeast, alcohol, grassy, cloves like phenols, and a touch fruity.     Very peppery, oranges, lemons, caramel, bready, biscuits, phenols, floral, hay, and grainy.     M: A creamy, carbonated, medium body, and some alcohol warming.     O: This beer seriously lacks refinement. The beer is more spicy than normal, the alcohol comes off abrasive. It is just an average beer nothing special. The beer has potential.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Maybe I'm just new to Belgian style ales, but this is a win for me. Usually an IPA guy, it's a nice change from the norm. The golden monkey is a strong, heavy but not too heavy, spicy brew. The initial is a front of alcohol that smoothes away with a lingering malty spice. Give it a shot, kind of a funky brew. Definitely keeping it stocked in the beer cooler.

I like it as it compliments to fruitier yeast and curbs it with a nice spice undertone, but it does seem to overpower a lot of the beer. Easy to drink, light on the system, I would certainly recommend. Thumbs up.

Alcohol is hiding and could beat me up. Overall I'm glad I tried it, but I wont be buying a six pack of this.

Smell is of sweet apple juice spiced with coriander and pepper with undertones of yeast coming through. You can smell the sweetness in this beer.     Taste follows the nose initially with a blend of yeast pepper and clove. Bit of an apple juice type flavor underneath with expected sweetness ... and then ... YIKES. All the sudden the flavors all give way to a strong alcoholic flavor - think hard liquor type flavor. This is supposed to be a tripel?     Feel is very thin for a tripel. Medium carbonation giving way to a very unpleasant alcoholic burn.     Overall this beer isn't good on its own. I'd say its below average. Put it against other Tripels and its downright awful.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Very light in color (lager-like gold), though there is a nice cap that is well-retained, and solid lacing, as well. Smell is much more interesting and impressive. Sweet esthers combine with rich, malty complexity, and I definitely taste some dried fruit in there, too. Taste is sneaky interesting. Seems like a straightforward lager, but then you get hit with banana, bubble gum, and alcohol that is present without being overly aggressive. Reminds me of a big wheat, but distinctly smoother. At 9.5% ABV, this strikes me as a beer I could have more of than I should!

This tastes exactly like they took a high gravity malt liquor, added some sugar syrup, a couple of shakes of spice and ground up children's aspirins. Then bottled it and slapped "Tripel" on the bottle. Just get something else. Cheap malt liquor would at least save you 1/2 your money. Another bastard and stylized crapfest that is Victory.

look: 3.25 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 I've tried this brew several times. The first time I could barely finish my sampler. Today, it's only marginally better. Pours hazy amber with evidence of the bottle conditioning. Definitely a belgian as it has that banana tone. I'm just not a fan of belgians or this particular example.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a bottle dated 07 January 2016. Golden yellow color with very I igut carbonation. Small head which dissipates to nothing. Belgian yeast smell with just a little bit of an American accent. Taste is quite loyal to the choice of style, with the Belgian yeast taste and wheat - beer like characteristics on the mouth. Leaves a semi-dry lightly sweet bread taste in your mouth. Gooood beer.

I Smelled it and detected some Belgian character, esters and probably some banana.  I Tasted it and knew there is way too much alcoholic for us old folk (besides the yeast didn't deliver fruit to the tastebuds.)  I Feel like there was too much carbonation and, at best, this is a middleweight. The yeast lacking subtlety shows in the finish, too. The alcohol, the odd spicing, the bubbles... they all bug me. Doesn't leave me smiling.  OA: One and done for me.    Reviewed on the "1001" list, there is a very strong argument for this one not being listed. North America produces a dozen tripels clearly better than this one and another dozen that are in Golden Monkey's minor league.     6/4/17 Given to me at a party. I gave away the other half. I stick to my earlier review. Not worth paying money for.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 I was skeptical of a beer with such a high ABV, but this is actually pretty enjoyable. Doesn't look very remarkable, clear golden color with lots of carbonation and a maybe 1 finger white head. Smells very gentle, some floral, delicate citrus smells, and some spice notes. Taste is definitely not gentle...lots of spice (pepper, cloves, coriander, etc), banana, hints of citrus, and yeast. The feel was actually my favorite part: the spicey flavors combined with the light feel and high carbonation totally masks any alcohol burn and just leaves your mouth feeling pleasantly tingly. I thought it was a little lacking in balance, but it was much easier to drink than I expected...almost dangerously easy!

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 A - This is a lovely beer, super clear orange-gold color, a tight moderate head that laces massively and casts across the top as you drink.    S - Honey and floral notes, a bit of rubber, and a whole lot of alcohol burn.    T - Following the nose with sweet honey notes and a definite hint of flowers. A powerful spice hit comes in over the middle, hints of allspice, clove, steeped tea, and a close that fades into an apple booze aspect.    M - The front is spiky with carbonation and the close is hot and prickly. In the end, this is a heavy duty beer that manages to avoid blanketing the tongue, but it is challenging.    O - This beer is pretty heavy handed. Smashing with yeast and alcohol, it is burly. A bull in the china shop. But with that said, it does taste pretty good and it manages to avoid a number of traps that would make it too much to drink. Not a glorious tripel, but a good one.

Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, strong sweet malt, strong Belgian yeast, earthy malt, slight hops, hint of pale malt, and spice. Overall, weak appearance, but strong body and aroma, with a good blend.

There's a moderate amount of bitterness, but it's on the higher end of this style. Not my favorite tripel, but I like this beer a lot, and stock it in my beer fridge pretty consistently.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Golden Monkey brewed by Victory Brewing Company, with an ABV of 9.50% This brew pours out a nice golden amber color, with a small whit head. The smell of Golden Monkey, has a rich sweetness of grains and malts. There is also a hit of fruits and spices in the smell of this brew. Now for the taste it is , bold with flavors. You pick up on a nice spicy, sweetness in this brew. Along with grins and malts. There is a lot going on in this brew. I can say this, Golden Monkey is a different kinda brew. There is a nice sweetness with some spice. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a nice balance to it. I like how this brew is different from most brews on the market. The mouthfeel of Golden Monkey is, sweet, bold, spicy, and smooth. This is a smooth clean drinking brew. You really can't pick up on the 9.50% ABV in this brew. For being a brew with such a high ABV this brew goes down smooth. Overall I'm giving Golden Monkey a 4.25 out 5. I would buy this brew again. Victory Brewing Company, did a real nice job with this brew.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 3.75 BOD 8/20/15. Clear golden pour with a touch of amber. World class head volume, lacing and retention.    Classic Belgian nose that is a bit subdued in terms of being yeasty - a good thing. Light fruity esters (pear, apple and hints of banana), light phenolic clove and a hint of coriander.    Light body with a texture similar to water. Less than normal carbonation with little effervescence even in the finish.    The flavor profile is rather good, especially considering how well the alcohol is covered with such a light body. Intensity is a bit laid back, complexity normal and balance exceptional. No flavor jumps out at you - it all just seems to flow like a slack tide. A solid malt base resides underneath and delivers a constant subtle candy like sweetness. Hints of the fruits appear in blended fashion. Light phenolic clove is the main component with coriander adding a bit of a kick. The finish is a slow fade that is clove oriented.

See some sediment suspended in the otherwise clear beer. Thought they were carbonation bubbles, but they aren't moving.    A very soft aroma, a mix of candy sweetness and very subtle Belgiany spice notes. Might be serving slightly too cold.    Again, gentle flavors. Some sweetness and a slightly pepper spice/yeast note. Beer dries out as it goes on in the sip, and the carbonation and light body make it somewhat crisp in the finish.    MF - fairly light body and high carbonation - very in style. Alcohol well hidden but a hint of warming is evident. Beer is spot on here for me.    I like this beer quite a lot, and am surprised by its mediocre average scores.

Drinking from the 12oz bottle, the carbonation is excellent. . The initial smell is strong and made me think it may taste bitter. It was not bitter. The initial taste was pleasantly malty, with a slightly sweet finish. There was no lingering aftertaste, but instead a kind of refreshing feeling in my mouth. I was feeling a nice, noticeable buzz after 1 1/2 of the 12oz bottles, and after only about half of the bomber. The drunk was fun and clean. Overall, I REALLY like this beer.

I'm too buzzed to make a good analysis, but the summary is: floral, light citrus, some honey and bread, and a coriander / anise finish with excellent full mouthfeel (carbonation is perfect), and a total lack of alcohol bite that can get you in trouble if you're not careful.    Overall: likely one of the best in its' class.

Definitely hints of the Belgian yeast.    Feel: medium body and a good creamy mouthfeel, pretty high carbonation    Overall: A really nice Belgian Tripel

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Serving: Bottle into tulip  Served: 10 October 2015    Appearance: Pours a deep golden color with some copperish accents as well. Somewhat of a strawberry blonde, but not as red as that. Nice, frothy white crown on the top which collapses relatively quickly under the alcohol.    Smell: Plenty of yeasty complexities like you expect- notes of banana and clove, a pinch of coriander as well. Very sweet malts. A touch of earthiness.    Taste: Good, but a bit sweet to be a top-of-the-line tripel, in my opinion. Notes of banana, clove, nutmeg, and coriander from the yeast. Weirdly, a solid amount of pear, sweet white wine (e.g. Riesling), and mango. Not much in terms of hoppiness, as one would expect.    Mouthfeel: Medium body with medium-low carbonation. Thins out as it warms, which was disappointing.    Overall: Not a bad tripel by any means, but with so many better ones on the market for similar price and availability, one I would not pick up again.

In the taste the peppery yeast comes through more, along with some strong tree fruit flavors. Hints of alcohol are apparent as well. Feel is medium bodied with medium carbonation.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 October 5, 2015    12 oz bottle, tulip    A – Pours light gold with a tiny bit of amber, very high clarity. Head is pure white, and limited to about a quarter of an inch, dissipates fairly quickly but leaves a thin layer of lacing on top.     S – Orange peel and lemon rind, a lemon-lime spritzer aroma, along with some spicy-peppery yeast notes, and tangerines. Crackery, Pils-like malt aroma, with just a little touch of caramelization. On the back end there’s an impression of clove and banana, interestingly.     T – A whole lot of mango and tropical fruit, along with lemon-lime and a light nectarine component. A small amount of peppery spice follows. Malt is cracker, flour, dough, with a barely noticeable caramel or honey-like flavor. Hops are herbal-spicy, moderate-low in the mix, and bitterness is moderate.    M – Carbonation is medium-high, and the beer is quite dry and crisp. A touch of sweetness at the beginning offset by the moderate hop bitterness. Body is moderately big, the dryness helping to make it feel lighter.     O – This beer is very flavorful and deceptively strong, and truly enjoyable all the way around. A great American interpretation of a classic.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 I was weary to try this Golden Monkey, because it has a high ABV, something like 9.5% so you gotta be careful. It is a Trippel Ale with added spice.    Look-I must say that the color on this is the most beautiful and appealing of ANY beer I have ever tried in my entire life. It has a shimmering golden color like its namesake that glints far more purely than molten gold itself. The head is whiter than freshly fallen snow and has the consistency of lemon merengue pie with some foam.    Smell-I smell banana, alcohol, honey malts, and spices. Need I say more?!    Taste-It tastes like heaven if heaven were made out of banana. The coriander takes backstage, but is present. There is some pepperiness and coconut as well as cinnamon and vanilla. Bubble gum is present, but the banana is the most noticeable. It almost tastes like those childhood candies called runts.     Mouthfeel-This beer is as smooth and silky as it is crystal clear and beautiful. It is on the moderate side of medium bodied, but the carbonation is ample and fizzy. Large families of carbonation trails can easily be seen skirting to the surface to rejuvenate the foamy white head.    Overall-This beer is absolutely amazing! A must try and is vastly underrated by the esteemed brews.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Revisited 4/10/18    Pours a nice clear golden color with a slight head and lacing. Aroma has Belgian hints. The taste follows the nose with resounding Belgian notes. A light bodied very well carbonated beer. A very well done very complex beer. A good beer from a consistent brewery.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Overall: Maybe not quite as good as Belgian offerings but definitely worth a try if you like Belgian trippel.

Appropriate to its name, the color is gold with thick, 2-finger, snow white head and thick lacing. The smell features floral yeast, spice, and caramel. The first taste is subtle sweet fruit, with coriander, yeast, honey, and a hoppy bitterness. It is better as it warms to room temperature. This ale masks its 9.5 ABV quite well. It is pleasantly carbonated and enjoyable. I would definitely drink this one again. I'd like to try it on draught.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Glorious bright gold color with slight haze. A small amount of dotted white foam. Smells of biscuit yeast, honey and candy sugar. Taste starts off light and sweet of honey and a but of mineral and quickly grows in body strength and bittering. A huge rush of grain and honey build to form a rich wheat bread and a deep rich woody yeastiness. A bubbly crisp finish tingles across the tongue washing away large amount of the huge sweetness. A warm nutmeg and mild saltiness finishes long. Overall, my only critique is that there is a little too much sweetness forward on this. It cleans up well, but is borderline cloying at first. I got used to it though.

I can see pulp matter floating in beer. Taste is strong wheaty malts, a bit of nondescript hop bitterness, some sweetness, with some banana and some subtle herbal flavors.

Not much of anything in the nose... some vague spices along with a yeasty witbier smell..    Bittererness from the hops hits early in the taste followed by a good dose of spices (coriander?) and heat from the high ABV. Tart with a little barnyard funkiness thrown in. Almost reminds me of a lambic crossed with a wheat beer.    Slightly thin mouthfeel; I wouldn't mind a little more carbonation.    Overall an interesting beer, almost like a Witbier on steroids. Classically Belgian flavors in a definitely potent beer. Pretty easy to go past the point of no return with this one.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 4 Pours gold with a large head.  Nose shows sweet banana notes, spicy phenols, doughy wheat and confectionery notes.  Flavours likewise seem to be a cross between a hefe and a tripel. Banana, wheat, booze. Carbonation seems a bit excessive.

If you're going to drink a tripel do it right and get something made by the belgians, this is a skipper for sure I will never buy it again.

Bready malt, yeast, tropical fruit, herbs and spices and alcohol.  The taste had hints of these; however, the alcohol at times overpowers. Full bodied; definetely a sipper.   Although not the greatest Tripel ever, it is still solid.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Victory Golden Monkey or Cercopithecus Kandti is a style of Old World Monkey Ale found in the Virunga volcanic mountains of Central Africa, it is brewed by Pennsylvanian-Belgian monks under licence of Victory Brewing Company and each bottle contains at least 0.5% monkey, as stipulated by the Brewing With Monkeys ACT 1988 which states that any brew with the word “monkey” in the name MUST contain monkey or artificial monkey flavouring... anyway that’s enough monkeying around Doc, on to the review.    Poured from a 355ml bottle into a Duvel tulip.    A: Cloudy tangelo/golden body with a wispy white 1cm head that reduces to a thin lace on top leaving behind some slight protein-filled spider lacing in the glass. Ooo, tasty looking brew! 8/10.    S: Chock full of spice on the nose - coriander, cardamom, clove and green pepper followed by a decent T-Load (Truck-Load) of candi sugar and an orange/grapefruit citrus finish. This beer has bags of aroma and I for one cannot wait to tuck in. 8/10.    T: Flavour is a bit more balanced, sweet does dominate slightly, with a: Orange/clove/cardamom/coriander/candi sugar taste that was expected from the above aroma, along with coconut... yes - coconut - there’s this slight coconut flavour in there that I’m sure I’ve encountered before in Coronado’s Orange Avenue... not sure if it’s intended but it does distract from an otherwise Top-Notch Tripel [initialism: TNT]. Finish is astringent but balanced between sweet/bitter. 7/10.    M: Mid to light, borderline heavy, bodied with a sharp and creamy carbonation, a decent mouthfeel then. 8/10.    D: Plenty going on in the glass to keep the punters entertained, however there is that niggling coconut taste that detracts from the overall Tripelness of the brew, I mean coconut, really?! Coconut should not be making an appearance in a Tripel for reasons too numerous to list, but I will list the main reason anyway: It’s COCONUT FFS! In any case I suspect the off-flavour to be heat/date related - as the Coronado Orange Avenue I previously bought was out of date - I suspect Tripel/Witbiers take on a coconut flavour as they go stale. This brew wasn’t too overwhelming with coconut though and managed to charm me with its other flavours, hence the score: 7/10.    Food match: Big brews call for big foods - Bleu d'Auvergne, Pane Di Casa and Westfälischer Schinken - some of the best of France, Italy and Germany.

It has the full flavor that I would expect from a triple and is complex and sweet. Right up my ally.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Look: Thin white head dissipates quickly. Lots of carbonation and a good amount of sediment floating around. Bright clear gold.    Smell: Banana esters, slightly peppery. Slightly Belgian yeasty.    Taste: Starts big crushed black peppery and big sweet banana. Pepper goes away quickly and Banana sticks around. Not really picking up much of the alcohol. The sweet malts cover it nicely.    Feel: Light to medium light bodied. Carbonation is nice. Slightly creamish.    Overall: Really solid. Bordering on really good. It's an interesting dilemma trying to decide on this $14 six pack or a $14 bomber of Tripel Karmeliet. Not saying its as good as Tripel Karmeliet, but there are more of these.

But I decided to give my 2 cents because I need to catch up! Basically, this beer is overdone. I've told my friends that I think it tastes like mincemeat pie ale. The spices here don't do it for me at all. Yes, the alcohol is BURIED, but the flavor is a turn off for me.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Super weird tripel that tastes like a Belgian IPA. Very sweet, bright and mildly biscuity backbone balances the very aggressive peppery finish, with lemon-y notes of sweet and bitter. Warming alcohol, and still dominantly peppery, doughy, and sharp yeast flavours on the finish. Seems very confused as far as style/balance and overall I think it's just okay, but something about it (the finish?) secretly makes me want another sip...

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This beer is highly deceptive. I had to ask the barkeep if what he had given me was the correct beverage because I did not believe a beverage of 9.5% ABV could look this way. After realizing it was in fact the beer I had selected, I began to evaluate its deceptive veneer.     The color was golden, not too dark, not very light, very light head, and the taste wasn't rich but it was not bland either.    If I had a friend who I wanted to introduce to why drinking beer with a big kick is worth the money over bland light beers, without scaring them away with an Imperial Stout, (even if they tend to be the greatest beers) I would introduce them to a beer such as this first.    Simple reasoning behind my plan is because most novices to the world of craft beers put more investment into what the beer looks like than actually tasting it. Plus, let's be honest, beers with high ABV's are not for everyone. However, if you can introduce something to them that is very drinkable, albeit not as full as flavor as I'd like, this is exactly the sort of thing to get them going.     Also, this is a good beer to start a night off with in my opinion. While definitely not the best beer in its class, given the ABV and the solid taste and solid kick, a great beer to introduce to people who need beerducation. Solid 4.

There's a hint of banana from the belgian yeast. One dimensional for a Tripel, but not bad.    M- Almost syrupy, and not as carbonated as some examples.

Overall: A pretty tasty belgian Trippel, especially if you don't wanna spend too much (I got mine for $6.99/750mL), but be careful! The 9.5% will knock you on your ass pretty quickly!

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Pale gold (4) with thick white head and good carbonation. Notes of plantains, sour balls and cloves. Clovey start, more fruity than spicy. Medium mouthfeel. There is a heaviness in the body. Malt and cloves hide alcohol.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 From bottle into a tulip, appearance was a light golden with some suspended particulate. Good initial head and retention.    S - firm belgian yeast notes, faint candi sweetness, spice notes of allspice/nutmeg, some leafy notes mixed in with some peppery yeast spice.    T - sweet start then lots of spice coming in with quite a bubbly carbonation. Notes of pepper, nutmeg, leafy, and yeasty, flowery and quite sweet also especially nearer the finish. Good and the sweetness coats the spices into an easy drinking belgian triple.    M - big, very thick with a n aggressive carbonation, and slightly boozy, leading to a very crisp finish but with a lingering spice aftertaste. Perceptible alcohol.    A good beer but its isn't perfect and has its faults. Taste is not but, the spice notes are forced, camouflaging the true yeast character. I think there is also a bit much alcohol presence, essentially it tries hard to be in your face, while maintaining a very sweet character to ease it all down. Lacks the finesse of the style, but it is worth a try.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Belgian Style Tripel  ABV: 9.5%  Glassware: Oversized wine glass, but brewery recommends a tulip.    Appearance: Translucent dark gold with effervescence, and a thin head.  Smell: Bold spicy aroma  Taste: Strong and rich in spices with herbal and flowery notes.   Mouth feel: A nice kind of bubbly.    Overall, a nice interpretation of a Belgian Tripel. "Nice" and "pleasant" seem to be the best description for this beer. Has some character in that the high ABV is foreshadowed in the taste and feel. You know you're gonna get a good swift kick. Where the "best" Belgians seem more refined and hide their ABV much better. This one has a classically American "Ruffian" character to it.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This is a solid, though not great Belgian. It has a nice dark amber color and a reasonably spicy fragrance. The flavor is nice, though not as good as some of the imports I've had. Fortunately, there is little of Victory's signature "hops mania" in the flavor. I like hops, a lot, but not too much in a Belgian. Victory has a tendency to go overboard with hops even in beer styles that generally don't warrant it.    Overall, this beer is not a favorite of mine, but it is enjoyable and I would gladly drink a couple every now and then.

look: 2.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 L: slightly clear but dirty golden orange color if there is such a description. A slightly 1/2 finger head that dissipated quickly. carbonation is underwhelming. Not the prettiest beer in this style; rather average and not inviting.     S: yeast and malty nose upfront, with some hints of citrus fruits in the background as well as some medicinal aromas. Not a very dominant aroma and rather faint.     T: Citrus and spiciness and Malty upfront, with a slight medicinal, bitter and light chalkiness in the finish. Extremely sweet but only boarders on being syrupy. Tastes very similar to the aroma. Alcohol is balanced with the malt and hidden well.     M: moderately creamy and medium bodied. Tingly spice but not overly carbonated to my preferences with a pronounced sweetness. Slightly chalky on the finish.     O: An average but drinkable Tripel. The 9.5% ABV really sneaks up on you after a pint, so watch out! Could be more dry and digestable which tends to be the standard measure of a very good Belgian beer. A little too sweet for my tastes and not enough complexity for the style. I would try again if offered.
