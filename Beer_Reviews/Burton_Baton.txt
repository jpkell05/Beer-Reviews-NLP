Smooth mouthfeel, pleasant lingering aftertaste.   Alcohol is hidden, taste wise, it will become obvious later. : )  This is one fine brew from DFH, good job.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Look - poured from a 12 oz bottle. One finger head, bits of lacing. Beer is cloudy and a dark orange color.  Smell - this is where things get interesting. An initial whiff of woodsy sweetness and malts, followed by citrus, pineapple, and some vanilla. A really complex smell, a result of the blending process.  Taste - just as complex as the smell. The hops come through first in the taste that is mellowed out by the woody sweetness. Warmness from the alcohol is also detected, followed by the fruity notes and a very smooth finish. Now that is a tasty beer.  Feel - medium to medium-full body. Medium carbonation, and a heavy hitter at 10% ABV, though it drinks very smooth.  Overall - this was the employee favorite at the brewery, and for good reason. Complex yet easy drinking, "gentle giant" is the perfect way of describing this beer. A real treat.

Tastes of tropical fruit candy, caramel malt, oak, vanilla, floral (rose maybe), with a smooth saline aftertaste (not sharp salty like a Gose). Noticeable but not overpowering alcohol with a nice warming sensation that gives away the ABV. Full, velvety body.     Overall, a terrific DIPA with a twist. The oak barrel aging really increased this beer’s depth.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25 It has been an interesting couple/few days. I somehow got on a DFH Bottle kick & just decided to keep it going until I was completely finished with them. I had picked up a couple at Sliantra & then a trip to Subs & Six Packs netted me some more & soon, I was off and running (often running, like for the bus).     From the Bottle: "A wood-aged marriage of an Imperial IPA & an English-style ale, this hop monster is tamed by time spent aging in oak tanks."    Jeez-O, man, I could swear that I have had this before! Well, a check of several databases reveals that I have, but never at home for a review. No time like the present, beginning with a Pop! of the cap. I really enjoy a C-Line pour since there is no telling what is going to happen. In this case, it puffed up to form just under three fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, tawny head with excellent retention. Until it suddenly exhaled and fell like a soufflé when the oven door is banged shut, that is. Wow! In its wake was some of the densest, stickiest lacing that I have seen in a while. I am going to get Sam to clean this up as it may require a jackhammer to remove & I blame him for it. Color was Amber to Deep Amber/Light Copper (SRM = > 9, < 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose held notes of caramel, vanilla, oak, pineapple & hemp line/rope. 8=O We used hemp line as mooring line on some ships & going into the line locker, it had this kind of woody, resinous smell, but also ropy. Mouthfeel was big, thick & full, like a dollop had been scooped onto my tongue! I let it roll around like a playful puppy, really allowing the flavors to build to a crescendo. The oaky woodiness was prevalent, but the caramel & vanilla flavors acted as a nice counterpart with a warming sensation from the alcohol. Tasty? You'd better believe it! Dangerously so, in fact, since it was going down like water. NOT recommended! Yowza. I also tasted a pine/hemp resinousness that I had not gotten on the nose, but at the same time, I did not taste the pineapple that I smelled. Very interesting! Finish was actually cool and bracing, like a shot of peppermint schnapps. That is imprecise. The taste was minty, but not pepperminty. More towards evergreen. Very clean, dry, literally breath-taking. It was like being in a stand of evergreens as snow falls all around and just taking a deep breath. Get the sensation? Whew. My only bugaboo was its extreme drinkability. I almost feel like taking a nap after this. Goo.

The aroma has a light citrus/pine pink grapefruit aroma to it. It would make a great air freshener...hahaha sorry officer it's my air freshener. lol  The taste is an adventure...can taste all of the citrusy notes along with the piney notes. It is seriously an adventure for the taset buds. I wish I had an endless bottom to my glass.  As for the feel...it is a nice creamy smooth feel with a slight mild edge & snap to it that is very nice...which probably comes from the "oak-aged", but It keeps the ABV hidden well...I think.  Overall a must try beer, again, again, and again!!! Have fun !!!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 From the growler via DEPS in NKY and enjoyed in a snifter. This  legend of a strong ale/IPA pours a illuminated lightly cloudy orange  hazed amber with a beautiful head of white foam that settles to a thick ring,  thin light layer, and shows some delicious lacing. Nose of sweet brown sugars,  heavy grapefruit and orange zest, sweet oak, and earthy malts with herbal notes.   Flavors exceed the nose by a long shot with grapefruit, white grapes and light yellow  raisins awash in herbal and citrus hops with a touch of pine amid rich honey and light  brown sugar notes. Sticky, rich, earthy, and laden with oak and hints of vanilla. A   monster of an IPA. Excellent mouth feel; medium sticky body, medium light carbonation,  and a rich warming citrus and rigid malt backbone finish.    Excellence from the Dogfish folk!     Cheers

Strong oak flavor, which isn’t inherently bad, but it masks the hops considerably. I interpret it as more of a strong ale, with perhaps a little more hoppiness than usual, rather than a BA IPA. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. I like MoreBeer4me's description that it's like taking 90 Minute, making it a little thicker, and adding a shot of whiskey.

The beer pours bright orange amber in color with sticky off white head. The head recedes to an island and leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is faint with caramel and oak. The taste is semisweet caramel with an earthy hop bite finished by an oaky vanilla note. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. Overall, delightful and unique. It opens up as it warms so don't rush it.

Smells like a fine fresh ipa at first sniff with plenty of piney hops coming through being eaten up by vanilla oakyness and wet foresty wood. Taste is vanilla and oak right away with a malty flow into piney hops so smoothly. Really nice mouthfeel and sticky. To me this tastes like a barleywine, and the best one I've had. Highly recommend, although a bit pricey. Reminds me of white oak jai alai but full force, stickier and just very well rounded with no artificial or sharp flavors. Awesome   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Let me describe exactly what this beer tastes like.... Take a bottle of 90 Minute IPA, give it a bit more body and thickness and then drop in a shot of whiskey of some sort. That may not sound great, but the results are fabulous! Although some others state the alcohol is hidden, I didn't think so. In fact, if I didn't know the ABV, I would swear it was more like 15% and not 10%. Very tasty and a great sipping beer.

Pours a deep copper-nearly amber, with an excellent remarkably light-colored foamy head and fantastic lacing.     The nose gives away a strong, just shy of overbearing malt backbone that is alive with dark sugar and toasted grains. The hops arrive soon thereafter, but wet, and muted. The barrels are almost an afterthought, but a pleasing one.    The malt character carries over even more strongly to the palate, with the hops arriving, but in a semi-sweet fashion. Orange rind comes to mind, with the typical citrus notes undoubtedly influenced by the barrel aging.     The feel is a bit off. Rather heavy and almost sticky (though not cloying).    Overall an interesting brew worth sampling.

Aroma with notes of caramels, mild pine, a bit of wood, toffee, orange marmalade and grapefruit.  Flavor with notes of caramels, overripe pineapple, apple juice, vanilla, young wood and Cointreau liquor. Dry, boozy and bitter aftertaste.  Medium body with appropriate carbonation.  This felt like a hoppy and caramelly Old Ale. I would actually consider this an American Barley wine. Too much caramel for my taste, I guess hops faded over time.

The slightly tan fine-bubbled foam lasts long over a copper brown SRM 9 slightly hazy lovely bottom that keeps up a fizz of just a few tiny bubbles. Pretty new label with the out-of-alignment funky font makes all look scores high. Very slow-to-subside head leaving dramatic lacing on glass far side keeps the good look going. For sure the Spiegelau glass helps keep the head thick, all the way to the last sip.    Smells really rocket-fuel ethanolic, with sweet malty breadrolling. I'd rather smell more hops, but won't fuss about this, as taste is just fine, with enough bitter hanging on under the tongue to keep the malty sweet predominance from cloying. The oakwood is not clearly wood-flavored, but makes a smoothness hiding any sharp corners.     Where's the IPA in this? I'm finding it a bit too well-hidden, but then that's just my IPA addiction hungering for a hops sting that doesn't happen here. Comfortable mouthfeel of melted caramel candy malt is hiding the alcohol until I swallow and feel the fumes coming up through my nose. No noticeable hops aftertaste, and still no oak lingering.     A homebrew buddy of mine puts oak sticks right in his bottled IPA, so I miss this flavor in a brew allegedly oaked. Maybe Sam needs to scrape down the barrel? How many months does it take for wood to lose all its savor, I wonder?    Overall, I almost love this brew, but can't recognize quite enough of the IPA part of its vaunted English old-ale/IPA "marriage."   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Bottled 4/1/17. Color of a well used penny, nice tan head that fades quickly, leaving just a little lacing. Aroma has some sweet malts, oak and a hint of fruit. Flavor matches the aroma, a bit too sweet on the finish. Medium bodied, not much carbonation. I know it's a blend, but seems to be a "old ale" to me. I'm thinking Old Curmudgeon.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bottle into a tulip. Pours dark orange red with a fluffy white head. Smells of citrus hops with slight oak finish. Tastes of very nice citrus hops with just a little bit of oak, not overpowering, but nice enhancement. Beer is medium bodied and easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer.

Mouthfeel is heavy, and Burton Baton finishes medium dry and memorable. Also, I never really noticed a wood aspect.     RJT

Aroma is caramel, brown sugar, fruity, rich & oaky with floral, grapefruit, pine & boozy alcohol. Taste is rich oaky, roast, fruity, burnt caramel malt fronted with toffee, earth, floral, grapefruit, pine & alcohol predominating after the mid-sip to finish. Aftertaste is a balanced malt/hoppy bittersweet that gravitates toward unbalanced bitterness & slight astringency. Alcohol is prominent in both nose & mouth. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with moderate, carbonation, dry but sweet at the same time, with a drawing nature on the front half of the tongue. Very unusual. I fill that this is it's appeal. One that certainly lives up to their motto "Off-centered ales for off-centered people".

Refreshingly crisp with semi dry finish. Have been drinking this for years and never bothered to rate it. I know from experience that this tastes a tad bit better 2 years old.

I taste fruitiness like dates and the oak wood comes through, just a tiny bit of unobjectionable bitterness on the back end. Very smooth mouthfeel for a 10% ABV DIPA. Overall this is excellent and worth the $16 price for a 4 pack. Dogfish Head is truly a Standard in brewing. Well Done. Hopefully this will continue to be available locally. It is surely near the 90 Minute IPA i have come to adore.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 This is a great beer. Looks like a normal ipa, nothing fancy. Smell is subdued with hops, oak, maybe vanilla, and some mild malt. Taste is an incredibly smooth dipa. Slightly hoppy with a perfect barrel aged flavor underneath. Somewhat subdued, certainly not a hop bomb but really, really tasty. Sometimes barrel aging a dipa makes it just an overwhelming bomb but this beer is great. It might have the best mouthfeel I've ever experienced. Super smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. By far, my favorite dogfish head beer. Certainly doesn't taste like a 10% dipa. It will definitely sneak up on you. A must try if you can find it.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours a deep golden amber with thick head and lacing. Smells of light citrus, hops, wood, floral. The taste is very pleasing, smooth oak flavors with a tangy citrus zip and some floral sweetness, little pine and dryness on finish. This is a very easy to drink beer even at 10%ABV, would give this a medium feel but easy to consume, very well made beer.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This beer pours a deep amber with a moderate head. The aroma first conjures up an image of bacon, there is a rich salinity here, with wood, vanilla, caramel, wet pine, toffee, and sweet malt. The flavor starts with a healthy dose of vanilla, toffee, caramel, pine, sandalwood, golden raisin, date, chocolate, and molasses. The mouthfeel is rich and full, with soft but plentiful carbonation. Overall this is a wonderfully impressive beer - much more barrel character than IPA, but great in the guise, a really solid and full beer with just enough presence to provide balance and focus.

Caramel and faint hops are noticed in the aroma, but take some effort getting to. Tastes of caramel and brown sugar up front with the wood and vanilla notes quickly showing themselves strong before a faint presence of pine is noticed. Alcohol heat is strong at the end; showing who's boss and demanding respect. Body is medium to heavy and quite creamy, but doesn't ever feel "big".    What an excellent change from all the West Coast vs. East Coast biz, and a very tasty and well-made one at that.

It's quite filling. Overall, the oak and alcohol both show up, limiting this to a slow sipper.     Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a nice looking hazy golden orange to amber color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. There was some light clingy lacing sticking and then sliding into the beer. The smell started off with a resinous citrus to piney bittering sort of sharp hoppiness about it and then allows a nice slightly woodiness to enter into some sharp sweet caramel malts. The taste was entirely bittersweet, no ifs ands or buts, all the way through just like a spectacular DIPA should be. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body as I tended to sip it for the most part. It had a slight sharp carbonation about it. Bitterness was there but nothing overbearing. Overall, very good DIPA that I would definitely have again.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 One of my favorite Dogfish Head brews. I love the off centered beers for off centered people sloagon. The mix between the English ale and the ipa exploding together on fermination and chilling in oak barrels for a month is nothing short of amazing. Smells of pine hops. The taste is a vanilla, carmel, malty, oak, and hops. Very smooth drinkablilty for a heavy ten percenter...   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 This is the best of Dogfish's brews with 90 minute coming a close second! This beer has body, taste is smooth as Demi Lovato's backside! Color and shine of Nicki Minaj sunbathing nude in Vegas! Plus the bottle itself will remind you of a beer you'd find at an Oklahoma vs Texas Game. Drink this beer!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 A hazy orange brew with a slightly off white and dense head. Streaks of lacing left behind. Smells like oranges, vanilla, caramel, and sweet malt. The taste is citrus (mainly orange), vanilla, oak, caramel with a bit of lemon zest. There is a nice, malty sweetness and a nice bitter finish. It is a little hot but that is to be expected in a beer this big. This is a really tasty DIPA.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Another great beer by Dogfish, went to the brewery and the owner happened to be behind the tasting room bar pouring and suggested Burton Baton, it didn't disappoint. Looking forward to my next Dogfish recommendation.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 2013 12 oz bottle: aroma - very sweet caramel, toffee, molasses and brown sugar. hint of vanilla with just a faint sign of oxidation. appearance - pours deep amber, with a thin off-white head of maybe quarter inch thickness with low retention. the beer is hazy bordering on muddy although it seems to clear a bit as it warms. light lacing is observed. taste - complex combination of bold malt sweetness together with intense bitterness that slams the palate. the evidence of oak aging is definitely there with vanilla notes in the background. palate - this is a medium/full bodied beer with resiny, oily texture and pronounced astringency. medium carbonation. finishes long and strong with intense sweetness that lingers overall - this beer is not for the faint of heart. obviously does not mellow with age as some other strong ales and barleywines. as with other DFH beers, it promises intensity and it does not disappoint. after 3+ years this is more old ale than imperial IPA. if you enjoy old ales, put a few away and enjoy a treat a few years down the road!

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 A: Creamy, white, one finger head; hazy adobe to orange reddish color, quite a muddy looking beer honestly, very prominent lacing  S: immediately spicy, earthy and malty with a hop bite coming in as well, its a very pungent aroma that coats the nose, honestly. I do get suggestions of the old ale but more in the sense of a J.W. Lees Harvest ale, there is a subtle caramel here melded with the very grainy initial character of the malt. This is definitely one to sit with (not even because of the strength of the beer) because its opening up allows for more to parse through, so give it time, the vanilla becomes a mildly present tone, emerging from the sweetness of the malt  M: very soft and delicate, sits lightly on the tongue  O: This is an odd beer, and indeed one that scratches an itch I don't think I've ever had or will ever have. Don't get me wrong, this is a very interesting (and yes, very good) and entrancing beer, but I can't think of a time when I would want something in the vein of a burton baton, it's a thick, pungent and almost must experience and if that sounds appealing, given what else I've written about it then grab some now, I kinda feel the same way about this that I do about theobroma, it's very good, but I can't really see a place for it on my particular shelf.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A - nice copper amber clear color. White head sticks and leaves a nice lacing.   S - big floral hops, grapefruit, oak, very floral - almost reminiscent of two hearted but a little less balanced  T - again very floral, grapefruit, citrus peel, slight earthiness, oak def there  M - medium to heavy mf, alc covered, carb appropriate, aftertaste is grapefruit, citrus peel, oak, slightly flowery  O - really good beer. More flavorful than boozy at 10%. However, this likely wont be a repeat offender with me.

T: lots of toffee, honey, floral almost vine like hops and that resiny bitterness.    M: Softer on the tongue without the bitterness more pillowy makes the beer more approachable.    O: This beer has aged gracefully I have had it fresh and thought it was dynamite. This 2015 bottle has really rounded out any harsh bitterness and it's still hoppy.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bottle dated 2/1/17. The beer pours very nice orange/amber color with a light white head that disappated quickly leaving a small amount of lacing.    When I first opened the bottle I got a hit of grapefruit immediately. From the glass I'm getting lots of light malts. The hops seem a little subdued and mostly pine and citrus.     The taste is a very interesting blend of lots of flavors. There is a definite citrus hop presence up front but the malt quickly moves in through the middle. The finish balances out the malt with a lingering bitterness. In searching for the oak, I get little hints of it on the front and the finish. There is no hint of the 10% abv.    The mouthfeel smooth and slightly slick/oily with relatively low carbonation.    Overall this is a very unique beer. There is a ton going on but nothing seems to dominate other than lingering bitter finish. I'm really enjoying how easy it is to drink.

Smells of caramel malts dank, piney and citrus    Tastes sweet malt and citrus with some earthy piney hops. Touch of oakiness and hint of vanilla. Finishes mostly dry with a long pine linger.

I would love to see Dogfish aging this beer for a little longer than a month to get more of an barrel edge but its great as it stands for sure. A delicious, comforting beer with an inviting look, aroma, and taste.

look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Fantastic pour - great color, perfect amount of silky head with excellent retention & carbonation. Aroma was soft - I assume from the aging - but you get a lot of tropical / citrus hop wafts (cascade, a little crystal) with some support from a familiar malt & a dash of wood. Interesting flavor, in the sense you get a burst of oily hop right upfront but there is very little bitterness. That is all smoothed out by the blending / aging, which allows the pure hop flavor to shine undistracted. I wish the old ale portion interjected itself more, though the juicy hops dominate it. The malt is there but it lacks that toffee quality you get in a good old ale, plus there is a tad of fusel alchohol poking through near the end. Mouthfeel is slick and appropriate. Good beer, curiois to see if as it ages some of those old ale flavors develope more prominently.

Pours a light, hazy, Amber with an inch of off-white head that lingers a bit and leaves loads of sticky lacing. Smell is hops up front, some sweet malts, and then vanilla and oak. Interesting nose, but enticing. Taste follows but with the hops being more restrained than anticipated and the oaky, vanilla character a bit more in the forefront. Feel is fairly full in body, with a soft carbonation. Overall, I loved this and it's stellar balance between the oak and hops and booze and malt. Definitely top-notch stuff!

Small white head, lasting suds. Legs. Aroma is mildly hoppy, orange, the slightest of oak. Taste is mildly Smokey. Warming Spices, nutmeg, peat. I think the oak aging doesn’t quite add flavor to IPA’s the way it does to stouts. But, more importantly I think, it softens the harshness that many IPA’s have. This beer may have given me an epiphany on that thought."  **

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I had this on draught in a bar; a 10 oz. pour in a Dogfish snifter. It poured a hazy amber-brown color with a frothy, ecru-colored head and extensive lacing that didn't dissipate. It's a lovely ale. The smell is very aromatic with roasted malt, caramel, cherry, orange, oak, and resinous hops. The taste is an exquisite blend of old ale and IPA: It has a solid base of sweet malt with caramel, dark fruit, oak, citrus, and resinous pine at the finish. It manages to be both malty and hoppy in perfect balance. It could probably be classified as a Barleywine rather than a DIPA. It has a nice mouth feel with a medium body and moderate carbonation. You can feel its 10% ABV although the taste itself is not boozy. Overall, this ale is quite an achievement and DFH should be pleased. It's a terrific blend of styles that works really well. You can sip it for dessert or pair it with a hearty meal. It's terrific!

Tastes like sweet toffee, caramel, vanilla, oak, roasty malts, some chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, orange citrus, candied grapefruit, dried fruits, cherry, with herby grass and dry earthy pine.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. A west-coastier nose than I would have anticipate, with dominant pine hops. Pours a honey-brown with trace white head that quickly dissipates. The palate here is excellent. Much more reserved that I would have expected. Caramel malt, toffee, and trace booze warmth dominate the palate. The hops are a faint background, accenting the sweet cereal flavors with a subtle savoriness. An extremely nuanced beer. Medium-thick. As it warms, the hop elements open alongside the bourbon, to give a still richer palate.    This is easily the best beer I've had from Dogfishhead to date. 90 Minute is, in my eyes, the exceptional beer that built this company, and Burton Baton is its far subtler, more nuanced cousin. A huge win for the brewery in terms of complexity, and an outstanding beer in its own right.

The smell hits you right away, a lot of pine, malts, citrus-laden fruit. I also get subtle caramel, figs, and general herbs.     Taste is surprisingly non-bitter considering my expectations. Quite a subtle fruity flavor. Piney hops in the background but overall this is a very smooth and subtle beer. This is magnificent.     I often find high-alcoholic DIPA's overhopped, but this is trying to do something completely different and ends up being quite successful at it.

Smell is candied fruit, mostly oranges and apricots, over a sweet malt background. It's like a really sweet, pleasant candy that you can really eat only one of before things in your mouth starts hurting.    But the taste isn't actually that sweet. The sweetness gives way to nice savory characteristics. Toffee and a heavy tea flavor show up with a few passes over the tongue. Marmalade, too. Some coffee – surprise, surprise! – enters the picture at the end. It's one of those brews that's complex without much overlap (e.g., ref. dates and raisins). The more I try to pick it apart, the more I like it.    Feel is medium-heavy with fine carbonation.    I'm curious about how this one does with age. I had no intent to consume this a full fifteen months after bottling. I wonder how it is within a few months, given that it's partly a DIPA. It's actually really similar to Lengthwise's Zeus, without some of the floral elements. But I'm looking at my review of that, and there's nothing to suggest they're all that similar, so maybe what's stuck in my brain are the malt and weight.

I'm already convinced with this beer, its good, and its one of the best DFH has in their portfolio. Affordable price on these, they aren't Bigfoot levels of cheapness yielding awesomeness, but its up there. They do good with the 1 month oak aging, really hits the target.     I dunno if I would call this a double ipa or barleywine, but it works.

Taste is boozy, bitter, body is full with some hops shining through. This is definitely a beer that lives up to the description, you get an almost equal feel of barleywine and imperial IPA from this beer. A sipper for sure, very enjoyable. I'd say this leans more towards being a barleywine with lots of hops. A unique and fun beer but it really comes off as a blend between styles you have to take for what it is.

The color of the beer is rich mahogany with deep amber and rust orange hues. the clarity of the beer is mostly opaque, with the exception of the carbonation bubbles.    A rich malty aroma wafts through the rich hops. The hops is fruity, grapefruit, pine, floral. A subtle oak, vanilla, sugar, and caramel notes hides in the background. This beer smell is mouthwatering.     A sharp rich hops flavor with grapefruit, pine, resin, and oranges, explode in your mouth with the finesse of a ballet dancer. The malt backbone holds well like the hoover dam. The malts is caramel, biscuits, and some toasty notes. The aging on this beer is just perfect it is not over aged or under. The aging gives vanilla, caramel, char, and wood notes which play the extras well in this beer.     The mouth feel of the beer is astringent, clean and mouthwatering.     I remember when I began going down the IPA and DIPA route. It started with Ruination and since then my love for hops was born. This beer is just awesome, excellent flavors and so easy to drink. This beer has been on my bucket list and now I can mark it off and go down and buy a six pack. Just an all around great beer from Dogfish head

FYI the one I tasted had aged a year (very well I might add) so much of the real floral hops and the beer as a whole may have mellowed.

On the list of "1001 Beers". You decide if it deserves to be there. I'm getting too old to enjoy extreme.   
look: 3 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 Copper with minimal head. A thin ring of bubbles hangs around, and there is some sticky lacing.    Despite being half aged IPA, the young IPA contributes a great deal. Burton still manages to maintain classic IPA characteristics, with even some tropical hop notes on the nose.    After a bit I also get a hint of grape, and I would say the oak is apparent, but there is a sweeter quality to it, closer to cherrywood.    Still, the age is apparent, with some super bitter bite here and there.

Nose is malty sweet, with a hint of vanilla oak and a finish of candied citrus - smells much more like a barleywine than an IPA. Hops come through on tasting, with bitter citrus up front and an oaky sweetness on the finish. Unique and delicious. Carbonation is pleasantly assertive at the ABV and age. Overall, a really solid and different take on an IPA.

Fades slowly and leaves a nice collar and webbed lacing on glass. This smells like an sweeter IPA with some oak, bitter citrus, pine along with sweet baked bread and caramel malt. The aroma is pleasant. First and foremost I get a quick, sweet taste of caramel and vanilla, with some oak notes. The bitter hops move in, with grapefruit and some pine most dominant. The barrel is faint but noticeable. Medium body with a slick, oily feel. There is definitely a bitter quality from the hops and oak that leaves a dry feeling on the finish. A pretty good oak aged IPA.

I didn't realize until reading the outline that this is a blend of two ales but it makes a lot of sense. You sort of get a different feel from each sip here, and this is a sipper being so high in ABV. I get a lot of malt and fruit on the front end, sort of like a fruity breakfast drink you might have growing up. Overall very good but it is a beer that took me some time to get my taste buds around.

Alcohol is present but not nearly as boozy as it should be. Warming and slightly spicy with notes of Vanilla. Creamy and sticky on the mouthfeel.    O: I really like this barrel aged IPA/Old Ale mix. Great compliment of flavors... complex, delicious, and a real treat. Almost tastes like an american barleywine. Another winner from Dogfish Head.

Each sip revels a new classic hop note.    T: Heavy on the booze and hop - this beer has a sweet citrus taste up front followed by a dry kick to the face with lots of sap and grapefruit and some other citrus peel.    F: Full bodied with a bit of thickness in the feeling.    Overall: Nice beer - not sure if it lives up to the hype it receives. Nt a legendary beer but not bad at all either.

Aroma: Citrus hops come through along with the slightly sweet and bready malts. There is definitely an oaky overtone that comes off as a bit musty, but it fits in really well.    Taste: Oakiness is more at the forefront of the taste, bready malts and citrus come through as well; nice and juicy.     Feel: This is an incredibly easy drinking 10% brew and it's really a unique offering. The two beers blend together extremely well and the way the citrus, hoppy IPA compliments the oaky old ale is excellent. I liked this beer a lot more than I had anticipated, glad I picked it up.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Bottled on 1 July but not poured until 3 Dec. Color is a dark amber, cloudy with a solid head. A very interesting ale. We can pick up the hops in the aroma and the oak in the taste. The English ale tempers what would be a stand-up Imperial IPA. A very tasty combination and Dogfish Head pulls off something most others could only aspire to. I'd watch out for this one, the high ABV sneaks up on you. Savor it with a light snack -- a nice sharp cheddar, a hard-boiled egg and bread would be about right. We have to go to Wisconsin for Dogfish Head; it's not sold in MN. It's a happy bonus on top of our periodic New Glarus beer runs to nearby Prescott, WI.

Appearance: Pours a clear, deep amber with a puffy 2 finger head.    Smell: Bright citrus hops and fresh baked bread with warm toffee    Taste: Juicy hops with oak, vanilla, and caramel, bread malt. Hops up front and a 180 into malt and oak in the finish. Like two beers in one.    Mouthfeel: Full body and satisfying    Overall: A fine example of an IPA being aged. The oak will cover any lost hop aroma. The hop punch of a 90 minute up front quickly develops into the vanilla of american oak into an incredible finish just begging for another sip.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottle. 9/2/15 bottle date (72 days old). Appearance: Deep golden orange, clear, with a moderate off white foam head. Nice lacing down the glass. Aroma: Pungent tropical fruit aromas (pineapple, mango, orange) with strong resin and a bit of green apple. Taste: Rich malt sweetness with some breadiness and caramel. Quickly rolls into a bold but balanced bitterness and hop flavors or resin, grass, pineapple, and grapefruit. Leaves a dry tartness. Mouthfeel: Medium body with a low to moderate bitterness. Alcohol warmth is there but well hidden considering the strength. Finish: Dry, sticky resin on the tongue with long lingering bitterness and touch of bready malt. Overall: Really nice complex aroma. Malt character similar to other IIPAs, and the bitterness balances well considering it’s strength. Very drinkable for a beer of this s

Really a dynamic aroma. I can’t wait to taste it.    Taste - taste is true to smell. Very complex but the flavors blend beautifully together. The oak stands out but does dominate the palette. the hop bitterness follows the oak and keeps the oak controlled. But the malt smooths everything out and pulls everything together. I’m not a huge fan of malt forward IPAs but they are brilliantly used here.    Fee – great carbonation / great body. A big boy.    Overall. Not a go to IPA by any means. This is one you need to enjoy once in a while. But it is a treat and a good break from the “typical” ipa. Well done DFH.

Touch musty which I like    T- Very complex. Great hops. Wood is in your face on this one. Almost like staves were thrown in. Tremendous amount of heat though. The malt is there in spades and the sugar not too high. At least this one is not sickly sweet like so many other heavy IPA's out there.    M- Creamy a lot of heat.    O- Nice brew. Glad I have 4 but will not buy again. So many other ones out there to try but it is worth the $2.50/ea all the way    Food Pairing    This very good brew went very well with....... Cheese board with various pallet breakers like hot jelly, cured meats, honey and something a touch salty- I like oysters on the half shell to totally spin things around.     Enjoy!

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Burton Baton by Dogfish Head Brewery is a Double/Imperial IPA. Its froth is close to medium on the side of light on a scale of light/medium/thick. Its body is about the same on a similar scale. Its smell is refreshing and sort of sweetish. The color is of a slightly darker than usual effervescent amber.    The taste of Burton Baton is sort of unique. According to the brewer this is a sort of whiskey-esque Double, in that it is a combination of "new" brew and "old" brew, with the old brew being aged in barrels. I've got to say that this adds quite a sweet and mellow taste to the beer. It's as though the usual hoppy flavor is sort of veiled by this perhaps semi-smoky or sort of woody sweetness that gives it a really unique sort of scarf-taste over the hoppy taste if you will. The aftertaste still has the sort of characteristic hop taste, but it is somewhat sweetened by that same woodiness. The aftertaste sits nicely on the tongue as a sort of mellow spice.    Overall I would say this is a great beer. I really like the way that Dogfish Head tried something different here, and it makes for a great, very savory yet mellow, hoppy beer. Overall a great brew.    As a side note, it leads me to wonder perhaps as to the "original" flavor of the Double IPA, and if perhaps this sort of creative approach to modern Double IPA's suggests the original Double/Imperial taste per se.    I've heard conflicting stories as to the origin of this type of beer. One suggests that this Imperial title relates to the beer having been sent to the far reaches of the British empire, namely India and hence its extra hoppiness was good for preservation's sake per se. Another suggests that this same preservation was needed in the 14-17 hundreds and was requested by the Russian big-wigs per se from English brewers, and that the double hoppiness was both to their liking, and also amiable to the long voyage that such a journey may have been in those days(St. Petersburg on the East Coast of Russia was founded in 1700 or so according to Wiki, hence a beer voyage in those earlier days would have presumably involved both a land and sea voyage to Moscow).     Either way, original IPA's were probably in a sense barrel aged aswell. Hence perhaps this beer is a sort of more 'original" Double/Imperial than it might seem. Either way a great beer, the aged quality just makes it more sweet, tasty and mellow. A great beer with a different dimension than most other Imperials/Doubles.    The brewer's advisory to "hoard" it seems like a good suggestion.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 I paired this one with a bowl of hot chili and it was not a disappointment. You can definitely smell the woody oak notes in addition to the sweet malts and light floral hop notes before you dive in. When you do jump in there is really good sweetness up front, almost fruity. The bite from the hops comes about mid sip and helps to clear the palate. Some whiskey-like dryness on the finish. Another great one from Dogfish Head.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4 12 oz. bottle poured into tulip. Drank with sharp cheddar, blue cheese, salami, and pretzels.     L - red-amber color with a two-finger head. Lacing is gripping the glass and glides down very slow.     S - sweet fruit and vanilla notes. alcohol is prevalent, but not too noticeable. Interesting smell for a DIPA    T - The wood really stands out through the whole swig. Citrusy bitter hops but the vanilla-wood taste really smooths it out.     F - it is 10 ABV, but you can hardly tell. Light in body, but really smooth and easy to drink    O - Smooth-ness best describes this DIPA. The barrel-aging is a great addition to this beer, and it is year round! You can get a barrel-aged beer anytime you want. Dogfish Head did it again with this beer, so lucky to have them around. Cheers!

Slight hoppy bitterness but it doesn't overwhelm. Great beer.  The mouth feel is full, I would want to get a little more booziness on the finish but it was still very enjoyable.  Great beer, will definitely pick it up again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Another interesting take on a well traveled style from Dogfish Head, this time for the imperial IPA. This drinks much more like the old ale thread than the hoppy double IPA it is blended with. Pours a very hazy dark copper, kind of like the color of honey. Head is worth admiring as you take in the bouquet.     Woody oak character is pronounced, though the bottle I had was not a recent bottling and so the hop bite likely as muted with age. Very smooth to drink, got some vanilla in the flavor and a beautiful caramel sweetness that was mouth coating. A single 12 oz bottle is perfect for sharing with another person, but it is restrained enough to drink in its entirety despite clocking in at a hefty 10% ABV. This is worth seeking out and cellaring for the right occasion.

Smell: Fresh sprigs of mint hit the nostril along with a hint of vanilla and a handful of earth. It's a delicious scent that's both fresh and musky. A spritz of peach juice tops it off, while the smallest burst of bourbon smokes at the bottom, coasting across additional under-layers of pale malt and ripe cherry.     Taste: The malty backbone is sweet and complex, with flavors of multigrain cereal, rich caramel, condensed milk, and maple syrup. A savory, unexpected bite of bacon sprinkled with brown sugar provides interesting balance along with a taste of tart nectarine. While the sugary residue remains in the aftertaste, it gets pulled together by a medium-light bitterness.     Mouthfeel: High carbonation makes this heavy flavor profile unusually refreshing, while the medium-full body feels just right. Alcohol warming is not present, but is not missed either, as there is plenty of else going on.     Overall: I have to state once more how remarkably refreshing this beer is in spite of its complex collection of dark, flavors. Light and dark, sprightly and deep, this artful beer is an ace at mixing separate sides of the spectrum.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 As you can see from my rating, I like everything about this beer. Mouth feel, taste, look. I find it to be the beer that has no peer. It has a maltiness like a strong brown ale, but a hoppiness like the very best IPA. The oak flavoring is effective and makes is a world-class ale in my opinion. I compare it to Oaked Arrogant Bastard, but I find Burton to be smoother, maltier and sweeter and less bitter, though Burton is slightly boozier at 10% ABV. I would put this in the "one to have if you are having only one" category. Two of these might put you down. Share with a friend. Ages well. I've had a few tucked away, and Burton gets even smoother with age. It is not a beer for every occasion, but when called upon, it never fails to deliver.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottled 07/01/15.    Deeper copper color (SRM 4-7ish). Fairly fluffy cap which dissipates to moderate retention. Fairly hazy. Technically unusual for style but looks very nice regardless.    Smells strongly and primarily of hops with a bit of oak towards the end. Hop aromas are more of the floral, spicy, and pine nature as opposed to citrus — in fact, don't really detect any citrus at all.    Taste is great. There is a distinctive nuance of oak towards the end as advertised which makes a huge difference. Otherwise, floral, spicy, and oddly, more of a citrus flavor whereas the aroma is more piney. Seems rather complex/layered, quite a bit going on.    Feel is maybe a bit to the aggressive side, but very favorable. Absurdly easy to drink for ABV.    Overall I wish I had tried this brew much earlier, however don't know that I would've appreciated it as much without trying numerous other IPAs/DIPAs prior. Absolutely love that the oak is actually present and not just a marketing gimmick — I would probably drink it even without the oak aging on the regular. Good stuff.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Big vanilla and soft citrus notes on the nose. Elegant, woody, sunset-tinged brown color. Middling effervescence, but it doesn't need it. Oaky, tannic bite predominates the edges; vanilla, orange-blossom, honeysuckle, molasses, and candied malt comprise the heart; a velvety, white-chocolate hinting finish hangs around, but doesn't seem uninvited. The English Old Ale is the overriding melody, but there's a subtle hopped counterpoint that adds thyme-based herbal and chewy pine-nettle notes, as well as informing the *very* subtle lemon-juice touches on the nose, the mid-palate, and the (super) late linger.    Boom. What ho. Great big-ass beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 One of those rare beers that defines easy classification or description. Pours a mostly clear light brown and only a bit of head. First smell is wood and raisons. Lots of wood and raisons. Beyond that, it's hard to say. Earthy, gritty, savory in a way that perhaps a chili with some smokiness is savory. Tastes like a meal that you'd piece together on a camping trip with spare food items in a log cabin. A hint bitter on the end but not like any IPA I've ever had. Actually, it's more similar to a rich, dark nut brown ale, only not as dark either. Worth trying just because this is one of Dogfish's better crazy experiments, and it's delicious in a rather sophisticated, esoteric way.

Smell: Mostly caramelized malts but a good amount of hops as well that are quite piney and tropical at the same time.    Taste: Robust and satisfying, this beer almost reminds me of a black IPA. It has a plethora of caramely malts and fruity hops. Extremely complex.    Feel: Full bodied and lingering coating of bitterness that is also sweet. There is a vanilla lingering as well from the barrel aging.     Overall: Super satisfying and well-brewed. Very enjoyable.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Pours a translucent amber color with over an inch of off-white froth with good retention. Aroma smells of citric hops with hints of bread and caramel.    Bold taste features grapefruit, pine resin, bread, caramel, and a hint of vanilla. There’s also a peppery bite that adds a little extra zing. There really isn’t much transitioning, as the taste holds its form front to back. The influence of the barrel is modest but emerges more as the beer warms, as does the alcohol. Medium body and fine carbonation make for a velvety mouthfeel that is quite nice.    Overall, this is a full-flavored IPA with enough sweetness to contend with the hops. I’m still not convinced that IPAs lend themselves well to barrel aging, but this is good regardless.

Ahhh yesssss good ole DFH, where the only let downs come out of their highest rated brews and those considered high average are often world class. These guys usually do not steer me wrong, so I shall soon find out whether the risk was worth thr reward for this $6 12oz.    Look - Pours a moderate amber with a fusion of copper with a two finger slightly off white head. Cannot yet speak on its retention. Carbonation appears to be on medium with this brew. Head ends up retaining pretty well but lacing really isn't there. 4.5.    Smell - High strung malts lead off the nose with a big hit of earth and a certain though tame oak presence. Smells like squeezing the Earts juices straight from the dirt. 4.    Taste - Hugely earthy. I mean, you can taste the grass, the trees, the tree sap, and all the flowers in between. Malts are a large player and dominate the flavor with the hops and earthiness coming in throughout. This really is a complex flavor profile and distinguishing between the two mentioned is quite a difficult process. The hop bitterness is present with a driving juicyness that reminds you this is in fact an IPA. This is a big beer, and I suggest small drinks to truly appreciate the taste without getting an overdose of oak that will consume the rest. Where is the 10% alcohol in this guy? Not even a tinge is present. 4.    Feel - Medium although thick and creamy bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. That oak flavor lingers around on the tongue and reminds you to take things slowly as only high ABV brews get brewed with it. Not a touch of alcohol for 10%. 4.25.    Overall - Well, not entirely sure it was worth the price tag. But, this is a massive beer, adequately suited for a ' black day ' ( IE a day where life is simply too much and drunky land sounds like a nice place before you call to the noose) . Overall, if you like oaked beers you will fall in love with it. Otherwise, due to price, I'd say avoid. 4.    ADVOCATES WARNING : NOT A BEGINNERS BEER. NOT EVEN AN ADEPT NOR JOURNEYMANS BEER. EXERIENCED CRAFT DRINKERS ONLY BEYOND THIS POINT.    Heh, kidding new guys. Enjoy as you may, just don't vomit it up all over your über kühl hipster tank top after a chug off on a night of Stella Artshitbeer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Not sure what style to rate against, given that this is an interesting blending experiment of an IPA plus an old ale, but here we go. Quite a pretty coppery amber color, with minimal cream-colored foam that doesn't cover the entire surface but extends a bit beyond the rim after pouring a year-old bottle (08/05/14, reviewed 07/25/15).     Overall, the addition of the old ale and aging on oak puts this into that confusing category of DIPAs that can easily be confused with American barleywines. Mild piney, resinous hop character on the nose along with vanilla, oak, orange, and brown sugar. Drinks much the same, but adds some malt and caramel; hops are less prominent after a year in the bottle, which I personally appreciate here. To its detriment, the beer is less complex than a number of other old ales, despite its heritage as a blend. That said, it's very approachable and a great example of a year-round, obtainable beer that's good for cellaring.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Poured into an imperial pint glass at ~50F. Burnt orange amber and 3 fingers of creamy off white head that dwindles to a rich and creamy half finger cap. Lacing covers roughly half of the whole glass above the beer. It has a kind of glossy look about it... really nice, high quality stuff.     Smell is kind of quiet, but I get mainly vanilla and caramel candy and a hint of damp, dank citrus hoppiness.    Taste is creamy burnt caramel that turns into hoppy bitter over ripe dark citrus. Very unique flavors shine easily yet are blended extremely well. Definitely has epic depth and character from the aging.    Mouth feel is smooth, viscous, silky, and full bodied, with 10% ABV hidden deep down in there very tactfully... Very well done.    Overall I wish I had an endless supply of this stuff, but at $16 a four pack, it will have to be a go-to for special occasions only. This is probably my favorite brew from Dogfish Head.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I picked up this four-pack already chilled at the local store and I am glad that I did. Even though it is a bit pricey, it is definitely worth it. It has an even 10% ABV and about 70 IBUs. Let’s see what we got here.    Look-It pours a mild auburn color with a yellow tinge in the right light; medium clarity and plentiful carbonation. The head is full bodied and foamy and lingers all the way down leaving a very fine and delicate lacing on the glass. Very nice!    Smell-It smells of vanilla and citrus!    Taste-The taste is rich and deep. It is so refreshing, because the vanilla notes play on the tongue for a long time while the flavors of citrus, candied cherries, oak, and then it gives way to a hoppiness that sing high notes above the mild sweetness. It isn’t too sweet at all and what’s more is that the listed flavors interact with one another so well. They even form sort of a candied yam flavor like your favorite dish from Thanksgiving! It isn’t a palate wrecker, but the hops are definitely present and delicious. The alcohol is strong, but not overpowering. I definitely taste the two different blends that the brewer boasts. Excellent beer!    Mouthfeel-This is a very silky smooth beer where even the plentiful carbonation does not contribute in an overwhelming manner. The carbonation manifests itself as a sort of afterthought that is gentle and smooth complimenting the bite from the hops and alcohol, I think you’ll agree that this is a great beer!    Overall-I am definitely pleased with this variety. I think that everyone should try it as long as it is served chilled and poured into a nice glass you will get the full experience. What’s really cool about this beer is the brewers threaded two beers together and then aged them in an oak barrel. They brew and English-style old ale and an imperial IPA and then thread them together and then let them sit in oaky barrels; absolutely delicious and so drinkable. It drinks like a 7-8% ABV so tread carefully! Cheers!

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 The pour is a gift from the Heavens. Starts off with a thickish, murky copper color that brings about a cascading head. The head is really thick and foamy and retains for a good while. Eventually the head drops, but only slightly, from the sides leaving an amazingly thick lace stuck to the glass.    Really on I picked up the Pacific a northwest hops but after letting the beer sit for a minute, the PNW scents are gone replaced by oak, vanilla, and caramel. There's a splash of Barleywine in the nose.     This isn't a standard issue double IPA. Piney notes abound, but the oak aging has transformed this beer into a style almost all it's own. A very Earthy flavor dominates with the high alcohol content bringing about a sprit like quality.     Bitterness dominates, but there is a drinkability to it as it's not a palate wrecker. It's thick and full bodied, and fairly manly. It goes down pretty easy despite an aggressive alcohol kick, but it shits off at the swallow, never coating the tongue or holding it hostage.    I don't care much for the brewery but I consider this one of their best offerings. Not so much a go-to beer as it is a change of lace from the usual stuff.

The flavors lined up this was as well - a fun balance of a big hoppy beer with the best aspects of an Old Ale, all with some wood tones.

Taste: good bit of sweet malt and totally dominated by the hops; I don't pick up the oak or the vanilla, but I do get the lingering oak tannins. Not bad; well balanced    Mouthfeel: creamy    Remarks: pretty good, but American IPAs aren't my favorite style; not something I'd likely buy again.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Like many of us drinking a variety of American craft beers I'm suffering from a bit of IPA overkill. This beer could bring me back to the style, the barreling brought it a complexity that made it really interesting.   
look: 3 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 3.25 $3.99/bottle at Total Wine Tampa. Pours a super creamy head. Tastes of bitter orange. Oak gives it a smooth, creaminess- almost like a nitro. Alcohol, hop bitterness, and oak flavors meld together in the finish. Very unique, classy IPA. I would not mind having this again, especially with that abv, but wouldn't go out of my way, as the "dank-creamsicle" flavor is a tad off-putting.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 I'm not the biggest ipa fan but I found this to absolutely outstanding. The oak aging cuts down on the hop assault making this very smooth and drinkable. At 10% you can get into trouble real quick.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 On tap at the Fairfax DFH.    Appearance - served in a snifter with 1/2" head - moderate lacing on the glass.    Smell - earthiness, sweetness, spice; very intricate/interlaced aromas.    Taste - fantastic! As complex as the smell, the taste is none other than classic IIPA. Perfect balance of bitter hops and sweet malt; nothing overpowers. At 10% a.b.v, I figured I'd be feeling the burn, but this was as smooth as they come.    Mouthfeel - medium. Coats the tongue well.    Drinkability - with the high a.b.v, I could only drink a couple, but I would be very happy doing it.     Thanks DFH!

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Other than an unusual smell, this beer exceeded what I expected. I would love to try the DIPA that the English old ale was mixed with to create this. Even with the mixture the American hops shine through and provide a great assertive bitterness and the oak aging smooths out the higher than average abv to be almost unnoticeable. Very good, unique take on the American DIPA.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.5 12oz bottle poured into a shaker. The aroma is bold, rich, and malty with caramel notes, sweet sugary citrus, and a moderate burnt wood joining late. The beer is effervescent and viscous with a hazy.murky caramel orange hue, and a slightly off white, dense foam head that has good lace and retention. The full bodied beer strikes a nice balance at medium-high levels of bittersweet. The texture is viscous with a zippy carbonation and flavored with notes of wood, caramel, spice, and a light citrus that spikes at the finish as a tangerine with some spice as well as a nyquil hint. The aftertaste is big and bold with burnt bread, marmalade, and a clean spice that mellows quickly but it still has a moderate strength and length.

Lots if carbonation     Smell is fruit and a touch of booze. Very faint. Defiantly the weakest feature of this great beer.     Taste is bitter hops with apricot. Malts offer lots of balance and plenty of bitterness. Oak, citrus, vanilla! My oh my so much complexity.     Feel is very nice. Coats the palate well and taste last for a while. Little booze for such a high abv. Another smash hit frommDFH

Nice malty backbone to start things off. Very bitter! (yummy) fruit taste blended with piney goodness. Mild oak taste poking around toward the end.   Buttery, crisp, bubbly and deceptively smooth. Goes down very easy. (be careful)   Delicious! No other way to describe it other than that. One of the best double IPAs. Nuff said!

Overall a fantastic beer, one of my favorites, I like it better than the 90 minute ipa but after rating it, it is very boozy and has somewhat of a barleywine taste, Id like to see a few more characteristics done to it to make it more of an ipa.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a 12oz bottle into a mug.    A - Poured an opaque sienna with a frothy, finger-and-a-half head.    S - Very light aromatics of oak and hops.    T - Very boozy and a bit creamy with a light underlying taste of charred oak. The hops take over quickly and hang in the aftertaste, with the oak still lightly present.    M - A little heavier than you'd expect from a DIPA, but still a bit bubbly and aggressive. Overall not bad in a style where an aggressive texture is all too common.    O - As someone who's not a fan of the hop aggression of most DIPAs, I really enjoyed this. Very well balanced and complex.

Smell - The smell isn't very aromatic, however, it is pleasant. Piney hop aroma followed by something sweet that I just can't put my finger on. Smells like brown sugar almost.    Taste - Absolutely delicious. Very sweet and subtle hop flavor. Wood and vanilla flavors are in there as well. Very complex and very yum!    Feel - Smooth as a baby's bottom. ABV is barely detectable.     Overall - Exceeded my expectations. Very delicious, complex, and well-crafted beer. Dogfish head does it again.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada tulip glass    A: Pours gorgeous slightly hazy deep golden orange amber with a creamy off white head that settles and laces lightly.    S: Sweet caramel malt up front, some pine, light citrus, and floral notes.     T: Pine and light citrus, grapefruit and a little orange, a touch floral, settles into a big caramel malt sweetness, a little honey maybe even vanilla, and some fruitiness. Maybe a little mid palate woody note. Alcohol is very well hidden.    M: Towards the fuller end of medium body, low carbonation, very smooth, though it can get a bit syrupy.    O: Really hard to score this one. I'm a self proclaimed hop head so I love a good bitter kick in the face. This one is very smooth, well accented with hops, but on the malty sweet side. In my personal taste, it's good, and given that it's a partially oak aged blend, I would say it turned out quite well. Maybe not as hoppy as I'd like, but still enjoyable.

Cold it drinks as an IPA with some oak characteristics as it warms to room temp more of an oaked barley wine. Very solid brew from dogfishhead. I can't recall the last time I tried this beer (several years) but I am definitely going to be keeping some on hand from now on. For me it's as good as 120 IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Bottled on 09/30/2014. Sampled and reviewed on March 9, 2015.    12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Pours amber with a 1 finger head of white foam. Smell is pine, citrus, orange peel, and grapefruit. Light bodied. Definite alcohol bite, but not bad. I get oranges, lemon, pine, and honey on the taste. Dry finish. A bit of malt on the aftertaste, but probably due to the age.    Not sure if it was the oak barrel aging or the age of the beer that was off for me, but I didn't care much for this one. At 5+ months old, common sense would say to avoid this, as it is an IPA. I took a chance, though, because it was a relatively high ABV. Maybe I'll try this one again fresh and see if it's any better.    Edit: After reading several reviews on this one, I see a lot of people mentioning the matly taste and comparing this beer to a barleywine of sorts, so maybe 5 months on this doesn't change the taste much. It's getting better as I'm getting drunker. Still a bit off, in my opinion.

Profile changes as the beer heats up in the hand, becomes more sweet oddly enough.  Mouthfeel is between 2% and whole milk texture.   Overall, this beer is pretty amazing and thoroughly enjoyable. The perfect balance of flavors and another Dogfish classic, I will definitely be stocking up on this one!

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I know this isn't exactly a hard beer to find, but I've been on the lookout for a few months now, being increasingly interested in trying it. I got a $4 single and, as usual, poured it into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint. Bottled 1/27 and poured 2/26.    Appearance: Poured straight down the glass and got a pretty modest finger of head -- creamy and soapy, but more creamy, and egg shell colored. The beer is a moderately hazy orange-brown color.     Smell: Since it's almost frozen from the fridge, it's hard to get a good nose on it. I definitely get the woodiness from the barrels first and foremost. I don't know if Dogfish head specifies if they use bourbon barrels, but I'm pretty sure they don't, and I'm thankful for that -- bourbon barrel non-stouts tend to underwhelm me. The oak also gives a vanilla vibe, with some citrusy hops in there as well. Even pretty much ice cold, this beer smells great. Not extremely potent, but super pleasant.    Taste/feel: The hops really shine on the tongue -- juicy, fresh, sweet, somewhat tangy (!?), and just delicious. Herbal hops with some citrus are the dominant hop flavors I get, followed by the barrel and the malt which all combines to make for a phenomenal aftertaste. The feel is also incredible on this beer... it has about a medium body with a fairly high prickly carbonation that really suits this beer well: it just makes the hops "pop". As far as alcohol, it's untraceable -- nowhere to be found. For bitterness, well, this is a DIPA. It's obviously hoppy, but *too* drinkable at 10%, and isn't very bitter at all to my tongue.    Just an excellent, excellent beer. I liked it the more I went on. The smell was better than the appearance, the taste was better than the smell... Burton Baton is a must try. The bottle suggests maybe cellaring this beer, but I wouldn't ever do that. The fresh, bursting hops is what makes this beer -- the barrel just adds a bit of depth. If you see this beer, pick it up.

Taste: the aroma transitions to the taste: spicy citrus and pine.Not the typical grapefruit  citrus in a lot of IPAs- this is a special spicy blend of flavors.    Overall: the citrus intensifies as does the malt character with warming. The oak masks the alcoholic finish. Excellent beer.

S: nose is sweet malt, subtle wood. Hops are subdued.    T: extremely well-balanced. Alcohol is well-hidden. Sweet malts rule the day, with subtle and smooth oak, wood flavors. Sticky, resinous hops buttress the huge malt character. As it warms it develops a slight boozy kick- very nice. Somewhat dry finish.    M: medium-bodied, oily, light carbonation.    O: very impressive! I wasn't ever a fan of oak-aged beers... Until now! Fruity old ale and oak flavors blend nicely, reinforced by sticky hops and sweet malts. Love it, another home run from DFH.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 12 oz. bottle dated August 5, 2015 poured into a tulip January 28, 2015. Thick, hazy copper that turns orange when held to the light. Finger of creamy off-white head with moderate retention and thick lacing.    Virgin oak flavors are definitely noticeable, with a big woody and vanilla aroma. Otherwise the aroma runs more towards old ale than DIPA with big raisin and figgy dark fruits, molasses/treacle, and vinous port-like aromas. A bit nutty. Bright orange peel hoppy notes are in the background along with some pink grapefruit.     Though the aroma definitely leans to old ale, but the flavor is definitely more hop-forward, with a big, tart, citrus grapefruit flavor up front. Oak and vanilla along with a gentle Manzanilla/fino sherry-like oxidation. Molasses and toffee and toasted nuts. Alcohol is frighteningly well-hidden. Finish is clean but lingering.     Medium-full bodied and moderate carbonation. Lightly sticky, but overall fairly clean on the palate. Alcohol warmth but not hot.    Living in a state that doesn't get DFH, this is my first Burton Baton and I'm rather impressed. Phenomenally well-balanced with sharp, bitter hops, gentle barrel flavors, and sweet but not cloying big malts.

Overall a bit too sweet for my taste    Mouthfeel: Medium body; Goes down so damn smooth for 10% abv    Overall: This is a solid Dogfish offering. I admit that i tend to shy away from them because i find them to be one of those gimmick breweries. But this one is pretty good, if not too sweet for my palate as i find a lot of their beers to be. The oak aged characteristics meld nicely with the caramel malt and citrus hops. It opens up more as it warms. Its good fresh, and i am planning on aging a few to see how it all comes together.

The hops are more prominent in the taste, but not so much that they interfere with the other flavors here: malts and that honey like sweetness give balance. The oak is on the tail. The feel is nice, a bit sticky with good carbonation.    A great sipper. Enjoyable to the end. I've had this fresh and now this one with a year on it, and I would say that I prefer it with a bit of time on it.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 A - Pours a rich, burnt caramel amber honey-orange. Forms 2 fingers of light honey yellow head. Whispy lacing left behind. Decent head retention.   S - Light faint notes of whisky, but mostly what you'd come to expect from an IPA. Citrus, hops, grapefruit, apples, oranges mangos and peaches.   T - Holy hell. This is the best "bourbon barrel aged" example I've ever tasted. Sweet buttery bourbon, maple, brown sugar, the whisky is full frontal and in your face. Expected IPA tastes follow in the development.   O - One of the best if not the best IPA I've ever drank.   V - Worth it at any price.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I brewed an oak aged IPA and I wanted to taste a commercial version to see how it compares.    A - Dark golden orange color. Somewhat hazy due to dry hop or chill haze. Fluffy white head and strong lacing. Pours pretty thick for an IPA.    S - Strong citrus hop character accompanied by an oxidation, oak tone and robust maltiness. Has a true IPA smell but can detect something different than usual and some alcohol is present.     T - A lot of flavor initially with the hops hitting the sweet buds first, then the oakiness with a slight woody character that could be helped by the hops. Then the malt and alcohol open up the back-end leading to a complex flavor. There is some bitterness along with the spectrum of hop flavor from citrus, herbal, resin, and floral. Not nearly as boozy as 120 minute IPA but you can pick up the remnants of the 90 minute IPA character.    M - High mouth-feel with light to moderate carbonation. About as thick as 90 minute IPA with stronger lacing.    Overall, a different DIPA. I really love and respect 90 min and I think because of that i really did like this beer but there is a significant difference that is added to the overall beer when mixing with the oak aged. It did taste similar to my home brew so I know that the slight oxidative character is supposed to be there and is attributable to the oak and if you just wanted something to break the typical hop explosion that is the 90 minute IPA that oaken flavor is a good way to go. The alcohol is not over the top but is there. I would recommend this for an adventurous beer drinker but I would recommend 90 minute IPA first and then step up to this complex and full-flavored beer.     Glass- Boston Lager perfect pint

Smells of oak, maple, bready malts, caramel, and piney hops.     Tastes of buttered bread malt, oak, caramel, and a hint of hop. The malts are rich and a bit spicy.    Medium body with tingly carbonation on the roof of the mouth. Light alcohol sting.     Really nice old ale style brew with some good flavor and aroma. Sips nicely and very enjoyable. I've been meaning to have this one for a long time and I should have gotten around to it sooner.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5 A blend of a barleywine and an IIPA. It takes the strengths of each and synergistically synthesizes them into something that is greater than the some of its parts.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Dark and strong! Like motor oil to the pour. Very strong stuff! I liked it a lot. Just be careful... It will get you there quickly! 
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A: Dark orange with red and rusty brow highlights. Darker than 90 minute.	  S: Complex aromas: citrus smell of 90 minute w/ undertones of subtle vanilla oakiness, raisin and figs and molasses.	  T: Beginning is hoppy citrus, middle is subtle vanilla oaky with dark fruits, finish is smooth, cripst with, carmel and vanilla cloying sweetness. Leaves your mouth watering for more.	  M: medium-full body. Definitely a sipper.  O: The IPA aroma and bitterness blends nicely with the sweetness complexity of the old ale. The subtle barrel characteristics adds an additional layer of complexity. Overall a very creative and impressive drink. Drink fresh as the oakiness and the dry hops begin to fade in about 3 months (see bottle date on the neck of the bottle). If you cellar this you'll find yourself with a sweet old ale after 6 months or so (which is less interesting than this ale fresh in my opinion). With several years of aging this could become an amazing American barleywine (or a boring one) but I'd drink it fresh.

Appearance: pale orange with a nice firm off white head of very fine bubbles. Highly carbonated.    Nose: heavy on the citrus from the hops, orange juice, slight vanilla cookie smell    Taste/Mouthfeel: not heavy at all, lemons and fresh oranges, bitter orange peel, no alcohol at all, since this is a fresh beer the citrusy hops really pop and haven't lost any of their mellowness.    Overall: This is a fantastic beer fresh, super enjoyable. I am bewildered how Sam hides the monstrous alcohol content in between all of the layers of flavors. I'm really excited to age this beer and see what happens when the hops mellow and the English Old Ale thread of the mix comes to the forefront.

This one never fails to impress. A very reliable, delicious and interesting beer; had it several times over the past couple of years and it always has been great. The oak flavor is a great addition and doesn't overwhelm the rest of the beer.    I haven't noticed any major differences between the bottle and draft versions. Each time I've tried the beer, regardless of the version, it's been superb. I'm guessing that this is better fresh/on draft, though ... but, then again, I've never been able to keep a bottle long enough at home to age it for an extended period. Might try that sometime.    IMO, this falls within the 4.25-4.5 range. One of Dogfish Head's best.
