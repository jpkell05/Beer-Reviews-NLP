Quite bitter. Sweet in the middle. Finishes dry.     Mouthfeel is just under medium bodied. Light alcohol warmth. Very quafable.     Overall, a soldid beer that still holds up against the crazy variety in the IPA genre.

Obviously, I can't check the truth of that claim but this beer definitely has a unique and delightful taste.    Okay, forget the 43 different hops and 65 different malts which I assume the person in charge of their website considered witty. Anyway, I found a video supposedly of their Brewmaster, Jeremy Marshall, in which it says that the beer is made with 2-row, English Crystal and Caramel Malts, then hopped with CTZ, Willamette and Cascade hops.    At least the taste of the brew is honest. It is simply great!

I can drink a lot of it, and I never regret ordering it.    It's sweet, has a great hop balance of bitterness, pine, and citrus, and finishes nice and clean. Given a lack of local options, I'll choose this one nearly every time.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Look: Straw colour, just a tad darker than your average lager, thin head. Not remarkable and I mean this in the good sense.  Smell: Resinous hops, some fruity notes as well. Not much malt.  Taste: hop punch, essentially resinous but with some citric notes (grapefruit, I'd say). Malt is on the faint side. I wonder why they added wheat when it doesn't really add up to the taste. Aftertaste is basically grapefruit. Still, good.  Feel: medium to light bodied, relatively high carbonation, dry finish. Very good.  Overall: Good but not great.

look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 L - Mid clear amber pours with 5mm white head that's slowly reduces to lacing.  S - Subtle hints of perfumed conifer.   T - What you expect of an IPA but balanced by it's richness. It's certainly way away from trying to be a 'fashionable hop-bomb'.  F - The richness of the 6.2% comes through loud and clear for me.  O -It's well balanced to me. Nothing stands out screaming out of place. And maybe that makes it a 'VGood' beer. It all comes together in that way. I like it, and would buy it again.  Bought from a London supermarket, likely M+S Tesco or Waitrose.    Hazy copper with a nice steady head of foam with pretty lacing. Nice smell of light fruits, flowers, pine and malt. Taste follows the nose, although the malt is more prominent here. Taste could have been more intense in my opinion. Medium bodied and quite sparkly. Good IPA, but not one that manages to stand out of the crowd. Reliable choice though.

Perhaps I had a bad bottle. Hopiness and good biterness were there, but tasted off, sour.  Mouthfeel was okay, average carbonation.  Overall, disappointed, not up to par with other well-known IPAs. Will not try again until I run out of much better IPAs.

Quite different from other IPA's.

(As always, I rate "look" for label/container design, not the look of the beer inside; I'm an artist and designer.)

Aroma is pine and floral with some citrus and grass in a thin caramel and bready malt background. The taste is resinous pine and fruity with a low malt profile. It is hop forward with good hop/malt balance in the middle, it finishes dry and bitter with a bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin-medium body with moderate to high carbonation, lively in the mouth.

Smells of skunk, malts, Budweiser, a hint of chilli pepper and fruitiness.    The taste follows the nose, then finishes with a big, dull, bitterness, grapefruit pith, and rust.    Medium body, slightly syrupy, with moderate to high carbonation.    Got at BevMo in Redding, drinking here Aug 18th, 2018. All right beer I hadn't realised until recently I'd never tried.

I can get with it, but I'd prefer something more.    Smell - A sweet dankness with hints of dirt and flowers, like a grandma's garden. Quite the lovely bouquet.    Taste - A strong bitterness up front, but gradually trails off with a sort of over-ripe fruit sweetness. Little to no malt backbone to support it though.    Feel - Thin body and high carbonation give it a lively sparkly character that keeps the hops slightly at bay.    Overall - Less enjoyable than other IPAs I've had, but not awful. Drinkable but not always enjoyable.

Taste: Average IPA bitterness, but not too strong. Weak malt character in the background. A little soapy.    Mouthfeel: Average thickness and carbonation.    Overall: A little more balanced than some other IPAs, but still far too bitter and soapy to enjoy. Down with the IPA menace, I say.

Probably been sitting on the shelf for months. So it's kinda a hit or miss for getting it fresh on the shelf.

Robust flavor of burnt caramel. Slight alcoholic burn-- which can be expected at 6.2% ABV. This may be their flagship ale but I don't think it's quite as interesting as their other, crazier ales.    This beer wipes me out. Just the smell of 12th of Never brings a smile to my face. This IPA is a strong beer without being pleasurable. I won't be getting it again.

Smells very floral, better than many women's perfumes. Has a nice bitter bite to it. If you're a New-England style IPA lover then this beer is not for you. Before I had this IPA I thought all IPAs were just bitter and nasty tasting. This is the beer that turned me on to IPAs. It is my benchmark. It's simple compared to all of the craft IPAs out there but complex enough to never get bored of it. Much better around 35 degrees F so if you haven't had it yet, put a BOTTLE in the freezer for 15 minutes before trying it; as opposed to having it on draft somewhere where their kegs are not quite cold enough.

It is a very, very fresh-tasting beer though (the most positive quality in my opinion), the only issue i have with it is too much grapefruit taste, not enough of anything else on the back end. There is a little bit of a bready/malty flavor going down at the end but not enough, not nearly as much as I would prefer. That being said, i do very much enjoy this beer in the summer when i am eating something like Mexican or American grilled food. The type of beer I would buy a few times a year but not all the time. I give this beer A-

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Very refreshing, easy-to-drink IPA. Nice amber color with some head and a little lingering lacing. Smells of floral and citrus hops, tastes similar along with caramel, malt and corn. Nice sweet backbone and just a hint of bitterness. Smooth clean mouthfeel, mild amount of carbonation. Very light and crushable!

Medium in color, nice head, and it tastes good. I would describe the aftertaste as a little bitter but I like it - the aftertaste is much better than some other highly rated IPAs I've tried.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 A: Poured a 2 finger head with some beautiful lacing. Color is a very light burnt orange, the beginning of Autumn when the leaves have just turned. Light carbonation. Can't get prettier than this.    S: Citrusy, piney hops. So incredibly fresh smelling. Some vanilla and almost tobacco.    T: Nice blend of hops and malt flavor. Aggressively mellow if that's possible. The pine comes across but is balanced by an almost a creamy wheat. Alcohol is noticeable but decently concealed. Leaves a slight bitter after taste and finishes clean.    O: A heck of an IPA that doesn't shove a pine branch up your mouth. Can drink this all day. Definitely a go-to beer in all regards.

Pick one up if you can worth the try.

Overall: People who savor lemon juice may enjoy the Lagunitas IPA flavour!

This gives a full 2 finger aromatic head that lasts.  The color is a hazy medium light amber.  There is plenty of aroma from malt as well as floral citrus/piney hops which seem like they will never end.  There is plenty of taste from hops which is a distinct citrus/pine.  Lots of citrus at the beginning of the palate changing to pine with a slight bitterness at the end. Flavor is full throughout the palate with a hint of malt which offers a smooth finish.  Overall, love the full, rich flavors, and aroma.

Pours a slightly cloudy lighter copper body, one finger thick white head, good retention, bits of lacing. Smell is grapefruit and pine, caramel and a bit of toffee, a touch of honey. Light resin. Flavour is mildly resinous, light grapefruit, pine, fairly sweet with a bit of sweet caramel and honey admixture. Mild resinous bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium lighter bodied, good carbonation, slightly slick with a mild resinous bitterness on the backend. Overall, a decent readily available IPA with a good price point. Have ticked this one years ago but finally got around to reviewing it thanks to my dad picking up a six pack when I visited.

Smells like cherry and other fruity sweetness, along with other floral scents. Caramel malts, orange peel, pine, and a faint bready smell.    Tastes like cherries. Supplemented by grapefruit peel, lemon peel, other fruity notes, that balance the piney and earthy hops composition of the beer. Feel lightly smooth.    Altogether bitter but nicely sweetened.

The color is everything I would expect from an IPA. Going down leaves some room for improvement. A steady taste of hops but over all bitter and boring at the same time.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Pours a clear, deep golden amber coloration with a medium, fizzy head. Smells of caramel malt, grapefruit and orange rind, with a hint of pine. Taste is malt-forward, with pretty little hop character and a certain grainy/earthy quality. Caramel, biscuity malts most noticeable, with mild hoppy notes of grapefruit, orange rind and pine. Crisp and dry, with a medium bitterness in the aftertaste. This the archetype of what I like to refer to as an "old school IPA". Malt-forward, mildly hopped, with certain grainy/earthy notes and dry, piney bitterness. Nicely balanced, but not my cup of tea, as I really prefer stronger hopped brews.

A beer with paying for every week by default if I can’t find a new try.

It's an approachable IPA, not too heavy for a IPA, and not too bitter like Stone IPA. Golden colored, not too bitter, not too hoppy or carbonated. In many ways its the perfect beer to introduce someone to IPAs. Widely available at most bars, markets, and liquor stores. It's fairly inexpensive, a 24 pack usually costs me about $19.99 or so.

L: Crystal clear amber with a nice thick head that left tons of lacing.    A: Fresh citrus peel and piney notes, a little bit of floral notes as well.    T: More of a general but nice citrus fruit and pine, pick up some sweet malt notes as well.    F: Carbonation is on the lower end, smooth, medium but thin at the end, very clean and dry, a bit of bitterness.    O: Very solid IPA. Not spectacular, but not deficient in any way either. I've been places where this is the only IPA or craft beer offered, and that's ok.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 I don't see a bottle date but the neck of the beer says: "226 ? 2 2238 1133"    Appearance: The body of the beer has very good clarity. It is a medium shade of amber with hints of gold. The head is short and white without much retention. Although it only leaves a small ring of foam in the glass it has good lacing.    Aroma: It has a nice combination of grapefruit, spruce, and malt aroma that is moderate in strength.    Taste: It has a nice flavor that tastes a bit like rye grain. There is a clear flavor of grain husk. The beer has a touch of an orange peel rind flavor to it. At times there was a light bit of pine flavor but again it is very soft.    Mouthfeel: It is a very clean tasting beer that is very easy to drink with very good bitterness.    Overall: It is a well made beer that rests in that sweet spot just above average. The beer has some good flavors and aroma but the hops are a bit buried under the grain husk flavor and the aroma isn't very strong. It's not a beer I would buy regularly for my fridge at home but it is one that I am happy to drink at a chain restaurant or another establishment given some of the lesser palatable alternatives. It's worth throwing it in a mix-pack or even grabbing a sixer every once and a while because it will scratch the hop itch.

The beer has a thick white head that dissipates quickly. The colour of the beer is copper.    The aroma is pine and grapefruit but not overpowering.    The taste is pine, citrus, and an overall pleasant hop bitterness.    The beer is light to medium bodied.    The finish is tart and dry.     My first time trying this beer and I really enjoyed it. I'll definitely add it to my rotation.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Description: Golden, clear appearance with a small amount of white head; pretty standard IPA look. Smell is fruity, with tropical fruits and mandarin orange up front. Taste has a nice dank finish and is not overly bitter, but it lacks the fruit that is apparent in the smell. Not a whole lot of anything on the front of the palate. Feel is a little more carbonated than a normal IPA and it's light.    Suggested food pairing: Burger and fries    If you like this been then you should also try: Two Hearted    Overall: 3.75 (This beer is good but I would not likely drink it again) This beer isn't bad but it isn't anything special. Lagunitas has much better offerings among that while not expressly IPAs are sufficiently hopped to please an IPA drinker. Pass on this one and try Little Sumpin' Sumpin'.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 Pours a clear golden yellow into a fifteen ounce mug the same temperature as the beer. Small one finger white head that quickly dissipates into a small patch. Little lacing.    Smells wonderful. Big sweet citrus. Smacks of ruby red grapefruit with some blood orange. Sweet caramel malt tempers the pine that quickly follows.    Flavor does not follow the nose. Quite disappointing. Leads with an oily pine resin. Some what sweet but totally unbalanced. Too grassy for my taste.    Feels thin and watery on the palate with decent carbonation. Bitter oily pine finish. Malt just can't overcome the pine.    Great start on the nose but fails to close the deal on flavor. Finish kills what would otherwise would be a decent brew.

S: Very good, signature Lagunitas hoppy aroma, a little fruity (mango, orange), a little herbal and slightly dank, and a little piney too.   T: It smelled so good but the smell didn't transfer through in the taste for me. More bitter than what I prefer but not bad.  O: I love Waldos, Lil Sumpin Sumpin, Lil Sumpin Extra, and Hop Stoopid but the plain IPA just didn't do much for me. It wasn't bad but I've gotten spoiled on the big flavor of the others mentioned.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 The appearance was a red/golden body that yields a half finger white head that lasts for about thirty seconds. No carbonation is seen rising. Some spotty light foamy lacing is seen trickling around the sides of the glass. The smell had some malts in front of the hops and comes out very strong. There is some caramel that comes out as the beer warms. The taste was pretty much the same with a nice added sweetness, very much impressed. On the palate, it sat about at a medium, sessionable, balanced wet/dry aftertaste and finish. Overall, this is a good IPA, however, with the malts coming out as strong as they do.

I have updated its score now.  Still looks nice, this time I immediately appreciate its fruitiness in the nose, smells tropical, hints of mango rather than citrus. Then the taste is really nice because it is almost like a pale ale with more intensity - in the manner of "less is more." Actually it does work the same way as a PA too, starts out smooth and mild and then bitterness prevails slightly in the end. 6% ABV goes totally unnoticed.   I might want to say it is in the same vein as Sierra Nevada PA - which equals classic.   All in all, I enjoyed and appreciated this beer much more than the first time, perhaps due to my experience in the meanwhile with West Coast ales and IPAs - should I say I might have grown up to this beer?   It was well worth trying it again!

There are some out there with more to offer, but walking around New Orleans checking places with a limited selection, I was stoked to find this.

Probably my first intro to IPA and started me down this path where I am writing beer reviews. Tonight I had a pint of this fine beer on tap at Ulysses restaurant in Wilmington Delaware. Very enjoyable with dinner. Gold color and beautiful smell and wonderful taste. A little fruit but nice malt flavor. When in doubt this is an easy choice for me. Love it.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I think this is a good entry level IPA. Pours between an amber and gold with a white/light yellow head. Aroma is fairly weak in terms of hop presence - some citrus and floral aromas struggle to get through some biscuity malts. Taste is a bit more pronounced - citrus and flowers. Feel is medium; medium carbonation. Overall, definitely not as good as the first time I've had it. Once you have time to explore you'll find that this is a very good IPA, just not great. Hop Stoopid is a world apart from this.

Nothing to seek out but a nice drinking IPA.

Golden orange with a foamy head. Streak lacing. Aroma is light fruit and caramel malt. Citrus notes and pine in the flavor. Juicy and resinous, well balanced with the caramel malt. A touch of sweetness to it, yet just the right amount of hops bitterness. A nice beer for any occasion.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 I picked up a six pack of a Lagunita's IPA at Meijers. I've had this beer before, but for some reason I've never review it and it's time to give it a proper review, so lets see how it goes. 2017 Vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into an IPA glass.     A- The label looks ok, it's pretty plain and simple and it isn't too eye catching. It poured a nice amber orange color tat took on more of a darker orange color when held to the light with a little over two fingers worth of bubbly off white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left some patchy lacing behind. This is a pretty nice looking beer, I have no complaints.     S- The aroma starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness with the hops being the first to show up and they impart a mixture of fruity, lightly floral, light green hops and light soapy hops with some citrus rings and stone fruit aromas seeming to show up the most. Up next comes a little bit of doughy yeast that leads into the malts which impart some pale malt, caramel malt, bready, light bread crust and sweet malt like aromas. This beer has a pretty nice aroma. but it's a little on the sweet side for the style.     T- The taste seems to be similar to the taste and it starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness with the hops still being the first to show up and they impart all the same aspects that they did in the aroma, but time it's more balanced and it's followed by just a little bit of doughy yeast. Up next comes the malts which show up just a little less than they did in the aroma, but they impart all the same malty aspects and they are a little less sweet this time. ON the finish there's a medium amount of bitterness with a hoppy and slightly malty aftertaste. This is pretty nice tasting beer, it's not as sweet in the aroma and it has just enough balance.     M- Fairly smooth, a little crisp, slightly creamy, medium bodied with a slightly higher amount of medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is pretty nice and it works well with this beer.     Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and it's a solid example of the style, it's pretty true to style and I thought the hop profile was nice and it had just enough balance to it. This beer had nice drinkability, I could drink a couple of them without getting bored. What I like the most about this beer is drinkability, it's pretty nice for an IPA. What I like the least about this beer is the sweetness in the aroma, it's a little dominating. I would buy this beer again and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid IPA. All in all I liked this beer and I think it's a nice IPA and I feel like the hop profile isn't full west coast because it doesn't have that dank and resinous bit, but I like that and it makes a little unique. It's not a favorite Lagunitas beer and it's a nice example of the style. Good job guys, this is a nice IPA, keep it up.

T - Less hop flavor than the aroma, more malt forward with an earthy, grassy, slightly bitter citrus after taste.  F - lighter to medium body, not hard to gulp down at all.  O - solid IPA. Much less agressive than many being put out today but a solid one noetheless. IPAs should have bottle dates on them though. I tend to not buy hoppy beers if they don't, but my wife bought this six pack.    Edit: after finishing a bottle I realize the bottle date is hidden on the bottle nack in black ink. Looks like this one is from 1/20/17 so less than a month old.

It won't leave you feeling down.

Almost tastes like an ipa lager.....kind of hoppy but not really, taste is not bad but nothing that just screams flavor. Had on tap the other day at a work function (at a bar with a iffy selection) head to head against Moon Man and the Moon Man kicked its ass. Overall though not a huge deal for me...alot of Lagunitas bombers i think are some of the best values in beer.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 12 ounce bottle into a tulip    A: Pours a clear dark amber orange with an off white full creamy head, lots of carbonation, decent amount of lacing, and some head retention.    A: Piney, citrus, hint of sweet malty toffee and caramel, citrus like grapefruit peel, aromas are subtle.    T: Hit of pine, then some grapefruit peel, moderate amount of bitterness, touch of malt on the end with a dry grapefruit peel note lingering in the finish. The bitterness does become more noticeable as the beer warms.    M: Light bodied with a lot of carbonation and a dry finish.    O: A solid IPA, was expecting a bit more. There is no date on the bottle or packaging so I'm not sure if this beer is fresh or old.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3.5 Look: Crystal clear, dark gold body with a nearly pure white head which starts out as an opaque film, but quickly melts into a smattering of bubbles.     Smell: A light mix of floral and citrus hops creates a nice orange blossom perfume. It is somewhat disrupted, however, by an out of place pils malt aroma.     Taste: While the crisp hop bitterness is IPA-Worthy, the hop flavor is disappointingly light. A tinge of citrus pushes through with limited success. Nothing off-putting here, however, and thecstrange maltiness in the aroma is absent in the taste.     Mouthfeel: Medium-light bodied, but with a suggestion of creaminess in the finish. A refreshing balance of dryness and juiciness is perfectly complemented by medium carbonation.     Overall: No flaws, but no excitement. Had the bitterness been higher, the lack of flavor could have been overlooked more easily, but this beer seems to play a practical joke on unrequited taste buds. The excellent mouthfeel is wasted on this snoozer.

F: Light bodied, crisp and refreshing.     O: Another solid IPA and another solid beer from Lagunitas.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This IPA pours an orange-ish bronze color with a medium foamy white head. The smell has some slightly sweet malt notes overlaid with some standard California IPA notes of citrus and pine, which is definitely not a bad thing. The flavor is a little different than I expected. There is a light malt backbone that contributes a mildly sweet character, but like any good IPA the hops are the star here. There are some big citrus notes (primarily orange), with a pine character that was more measured than I expected, and surprising also some herbal and flowery notes that I would consider non-standard for California IPAs. The finish isn’t dry at all and the flavor doesn’t linger like many IPAs, but instead is actually quite crisp and refreshing especially with the bold citrus flavors. The body is medium. The hoppiness is quite measured for a California IPA and for my palette that is kind of a good thing. This is an IPA that is accessible for people that aren’t IPA fanatics. It is easy drinking, well balanced, and the flavors are great.

GLASSWARE: Brew at the Zoo pint... pours a lively golden amber body that streams bubbles upward... a white, snowy single-finger thickness occupies the top shelf, with a distinct creaminess... the aroma is heavenly west coast hops, pine, tangerine, grapefruit, and orange peel... caramel and light bread aromas suggest balance... the first sip proves rewarding, with a wet kiss of graininess at the throat and a hint of tickle at the teeth... aftertaste lingers like a gentle reminder... medium-bodied and almost sessionable... the taste is heavy on lemon, tangerine, a counterbalancing bread malt, and some late resin--an IPA that knows what its purpose is... balanced, solidly weighted at 6.2%, and encouraging the next sip... not sure why this took so long to find my beer fridge, but as expected, an enjoyable classic....

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Lagunitas IPA brewed by Lagunitas Brewing Company, with an ABV of 6.20% This IPA pours out a deep golden amber color with a nice white head. There is also a decent amount of lacing to this brew. The lacing sticks right to the side of the pint. The smell of Lagunitas IPA is rich with hops bitterness. You also pick up on grains, malts, and mild sweetness. Lagunitas IPA has the look and smell of most IPA's on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is bold but rich with flavors. Hops are the first thing you pick up on, they are just right, not overwhelming. Then you pick up ob a nice smoothness from the grains and malts. There is a lot going on in this brew. I can't get over how smooth this brew goes down. It is really hard to pick up on the 6.20% it is just that smooth. Lagunitas IPA has a super nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering about this brew. This is a real nice drinking IPA. The mouth feel of this IPA is Bold, Rich, Smooth, Clean and Refreshing. Overall I'm giving Lagunitas IPA 4.50 out of 5. I would buy this brew again. Lagunitas Brewing Company, did a real nice job with this IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 There's nothing wrong with this IPA but it's nothing spectacular either. It's got a lot of the nice aromas & flavours you will find in many of the great IPAs; hoppy citrus, melon/tangerine, a bit of pine, pretty well balanced with bready malts. This makes for a solid beer with some good taste & very little in the harsh after taste department. But it's just a bit short overall. Taste is a bit less complete & mouthfeel a little less smooth & full than say, Lagunitas Hop Stoopid, or (for Canadians) Fat Tug, Twice as Mad Tom, or even the regular Mad Tom IPA. The carbonation was also a touch off of perfect. I would certainly enjoy this again if it were given to me or if I were out at an establishment with nothing better, but for the same price I can get something a little better at just about any local beer store.

This is not a hop monster and frankly seems like it is more in the territory of an American Pale Ale. But it is good, nicely balanced. Fairly dry.     What I really enjoy about this beer is the soft, fluffy mouthfeel.    Negatively, I tend to think of more assertive hop aroma and flavor when I think IPA. This didn't blow me out of the water.

Nice amber color with substantial head. Fair hoppy aroma. Good lacing as the beer disappears. Lagunitas' entertaining blurb promises a battle between hops and malt, but the hops are the decisive victors. Hops tend toward a floral character throughout. Malt is secondary at the start and fades from there.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Beautiful appearance and good aroma. Mouthfeel is close to perfect and the taste is complex.

Pineapple, earthy tones but mostly fruity.  The flavor has a very nice hop profile, earthy bitterness hits first with pineapple and seet fruits, finishes dry and earhy.  Feels medium due the malty slickness but very dry and bitter in the finish.   A rather mild hoppy offering concidering the ever saturated palate of the American beer consumers desire for HOP Bombs.

S: Once the bottle was opened, the aroma of pineapple and pine reached the nose. It's a wonderful aroma that almost reminded me of Pliny The Elder for a second.   T: The taste is awesome due to the mild hoppiness here. Lots of piny tones, very malty but not in excess - it's a very moderate beer in everything, in hoppiness, in "pine-ness" and maltiness.  M: Body is medium to high with a mild bitterness. But this bitterness is great at connecting the malt with the pine tones.  O: My first Lagunitas. A classic beer. I see why this is as classic as the first Sierras Nevadas. The aroma was just perfect while on other characteristics was not that awesome, though very good still. Would love to have it again!

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.25 Appearance - This is your classic American Ipa, It pours a crystal clear deep amber color with 2 fingers of white foam that replenish very well. Very nice looking IPA.     Aroma - I find this nose to be lacking a bit, Not because the aromas aren't there, they are but they seem faded. I get some grapefruit up front followed by pine apple and orange peel. This is followed by a grainy yet caramel malt and a slight breadyness.     Taste - the taste is much more floral than I would have expected, also there is some leafy grassy, hop. The grapefruit is almost entirely gone but the orange peel is still very noticable. pine apple gives a slight sweetness to it the back end of the hops is piney. All this is followed up by light caramel and a very crackery, grainy malt. This is extremely well balanced and definitely on the more moderate end of the IPA spectrum!    Feel - As far as body is concerned this beer is once again lacking, It feels almost watery with a very light prickle from the carbonation on the tongue. I will probably rate it higher overall though because it does come together well!    Overall - This is one of those odd ball cases to me! I mean judging by the rest of my points you would feel this should be in the 3.75 range but it definitely doesn't. It definitely has its pitfalls but what works comes together in such a way as to enhance the entire beer and make a very nice moderate IPA. I would definitely drink this again!

Good head retention and lacing.    S: Balanced aroma with hops, citrus and some pine.    T: Well balanced IPA flavor. Sort of like the aroma, with citrus, malt and hops.     F: Smooth, well balanced finish. A little bitterness at the end, but not overpowering    O: Did I mention well balanced? This is a very good IPA, with enough flavor to satisfy, but not so overpowering in alcohol or hops that you can only have one. Pretty much my go to beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 First thing to strike me: the smell. I mean, really. I can smell this from 8 inches away, and my sense of smell is below average. It has an air freshener, aerosol quality to it. Could be either pleasant or overwhelming depending on personal preference. * The smell's reach has dissipated significantly after being poured and setting for a few minutes.    Has a thick, frothy head with iridescent bubbles that make me think of soap. actually, this may have pinesol in it. Pours a nice and clear, copper to amber color.     Very light taste upon impact, fades to a sharp bitter bite upon swallowing, leaving behind a stinging-nettle-like aftertaste that does not linger for more than a four or five seconds, before leaving behind an almost undetectable hops after-aftertaste that sticks aroud much longer. Not pickig up too many notes. Maybe some tiny bit of something citrus, like orange peel or lemongrass, but nothing prevalent.    Feels rather good in the mouth; despite wild, foamy head, it does not foam up in the mouth too muh and intead has a quite pleasant texture. 85% liquid, 15% froth, if I had to venture a guess.    All-and-all, Langunitas IPA would ot be my stand-by for IPA, but that's just me. It could easily be someone else's stand-by, and I would obect neither to drinking it nor to serving it.

Smell: Citrus, lime, grapefruit, toasted malt character. Extremely balanced.  Taste: Floral and a little dark. Nothing to astonishing for an IPA. Grapefruit is the most vibrant flavor. Very mild sweet aftertaste.  Feel: carbonated and full bodied with a well balanced mix of lightness and bready malts.   Overall: Extremely balanced IPA and perfect for all occasions. Made for repeat drinking.

The nose is malty with some faint grapefruit and pine. The taste follows the nose: it has a nice malty base with some dank, bitter hops and grapefruit. You can also taste some sweeter fruit at the finish. It is a medium-bodied ale with moderate carbonation and the 6.2% ABV is not an issue. Overall, there is nothing wrong with this IPA except that I cannot avoid comparing it to Sucks, which is world-class.

Mostly a grapefruit citrus, somewhat floral too.    Taste is an interesting balance. I can really taste the malts at the finish. This seems to reduce the bitterness quite a bit.     Light and slightly dry feel.    All things considered, this beer is a classic ! An interesting link in the chain of IPA development. Not exactly a west coast IPA by today's standards. But 15 years ago this was pretty cutting edge. I can taste the history.

It poured a nice golden color with a good head that dissipated rather quickly, leaving lace all the way down the glass. Aroma was of pine and grapefruit, which I thought was a bit mild for a west coast IPA. There was a nice malt backbone that supported the hops well to create a beer that is enjoyable to drink.

look: 2.75 | smell: 1.5 | taste: 1 | feel: 1.5 | overall: 1.5 Not going too in depth... But this is a very basic beginning, middle and ending IPA, almost no aroma, to start... Then there's barely any flavor. I don't get hints of anything in it. Hops are manageably par for the course. Only saving grace to Lagunitas IPA (that I'd say) is there's no weird aftertaste or effect.... A very mediocre intro to IPAs... And if you've had ANY flavored IPA, I say skip this one   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Pours a little dark. Clear. White head. Aroma is underwhelming. Lots of biscuity malt character. Some spicy hops. Thin but easy drinking. A pretty good widely available IPA, but weak in comparison to the IPAs I'm used to.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12 oz. bottle into a snifter. Light copper in color, topped with about a finger width's head of bubbly, white foam. Transluscent in appearance - overall good clarity albeit a bit hazy. Dank pine, hops, citrus, and a touch of grapefruit on the nose. The taste follows along, with a decent bitterness presenting up front, then giving way to a juicy, fruity sweetness. Lots of grapefruit, mango and maybe some pineapple in there. Nothing stand-out, but very well balanced. The bitterness is far from overwhelming, but remains more than noticable. Good feel, pretty standard. On the creamy side, which is nice. The flavors of this beer fit perfectly within the 6%-8% ABV threshold.     Again, nothing stands out to me, but this is a solid IPA for sure.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 I've never been big on IPAs at all, but this was one of the first I tried and actually enjoyed. When I'm feeling an IPA, I go for this one. I'm picky on my IPAs so the fact I like this one means it is just the right amount of hoppiness for me.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 From tap    The color is a nice honey amber color with a one inch white foamy head. Nice lacing on glass too.    Wish the smell was more pronounced. There are hints of pine and citrus peels.     The taste is on par with ano IPA. Not overpowering but enough to know I'm drinking a beer. Hoppy, slight citrus notes, not overbearing pine or grassy notes.    Great level of carbonation. Feels a little more rich than other beers. Sips well.    Overall, a nice IPA. Nothing extraordinary but not boring either. Great beer to drink while at a bar. Pairs easily with a nice Angus burger.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Serving Type: Bottle  Consumed: 4.14.16    A: 4.5 Pours a clear, orange-gold with a one-inch, white head. Pretty good retention and nice lacing left in the glass.    S: 4 Good balance of malt and hop with some sweetness mixing in nicely with pine and citrus. Nice aromas overall, but a bit muted.    T: 4.25 Flavors are like the nose, but a bit stronger. Still good balance with a mild malt sweetness up front before orange, pine, and lemon kick in. The finish has a nice graininess to balance out the mild hop bitterness.    M: 4.5 Great body and carbonation with a creamy, substantial feel that’s still refreshing.    O: 4.25 This is a classic example of a clean, well-executed IPA. It’s not super hop-forward and isn’t exactly cutting-edge anymore, but it still hits the spot just about every time.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 More in common with English style IPA than typical west coast IPAs. Light copper yellow color. Easy on the palate and a restrained bitterness (51 ibu). Bombers are always reasonably priced it seems. All adds up to a good everyday quencher. Wish I could have found a date or at least a code on the 22 oz bottle.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 The beer was a solid copper color, with a half inch head. The smell was simply of fresh hops and citrus. It tasted very crisp and the taste of hops was very prevalent with a minor hint of malt flavor and pine. There was a good level of carbonation which made it refreshing and it also wasn't too bitter. A very nice beginner IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Poured into a snifter/tulip/wine glass from a 22 oz bottle    I can't even imagine all the times I have had this beer and yet I have never rated/reviewed it? That is just beyond me.    A - A nice simple copper color, one finger white foamy head with a bit of legs/lacing    S - Pine, sweet and toasted malts/grains, bright citrus (lemon, orange, lime), biscuit yeast, nice sugar and just all around hoppy. The smell is the least impressive part of this great beer.     T - Really nice balance of hops (pine and citrus) and malt (sweet and toasted) with a very nice biscuit yeast, nice sweetness and just a very well done simple from start to finish IPA.    M - Medium carbonation, medium acidity, nice complexity, well balanced and the hop/malt finish you'd expect from a staple IPA.    D/O - Refreshing, simple (but not lacking), easy to drink and smooth as heck. As a staple IPA and what you'd call and "everyday'er" this beer is perfect. Anyone looking for something more should try this one but, may end up moving on -- for the time being (don't worry, you'll be back). If you like hops and malt in a perfect balance, this is your go to ale!    Final thoughts - At less than $8 a six pack this beer can be an everyday beer for most and at 6% ABV, why the heck not? Really well done and near perfect for what it is. The only thing lacking (for me) is the nose doesn't represent the rest of the ale.

look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass.    Look: Pours copper with off-white creamy 3/4 inch head.     Smell: Citrus (grapefruit) and eucalyptus comes through strong. Mild hop smell. Very reminiscent of strawberry fruit to go's by SunRype.    Taste: Strong hit of citrus and grapefruit along with florals off the start, followed by pine and some mild malt. Hoppy bitterness through the finish, but nothing overpowering.    Feel: Mild carbonation and a light mouth feel. Finishes on the dry side.    Overall: Very easy IPA to drink. Not crazy hoppy or piney like others. Pretty well rounded and you could easy enjoy a number of these in a row. Great for relaxing outside in the summer.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Pours that sticky copper liquid, 1/2" white head. Aroma hit those copper and pine hop notes.     Taste is reliable, plenty of grapefruit and pine bitterness. Seems like the other offerings from the brewery in this vein drop more dry late stage hopping than this one.     Pretty reliable, very good when fresh, great cost point.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours clear brass with a patchy, small head that manages to drape the glass in foam. Light citrusy hopes and some cookie dough pale malts in the nose. Moderate hoppiness in the taste, more citrus,, grapefruit some floral and pine notes. Solid doughy maltiness keeps everything in balance. Moderately light bodied with a smooth, creamy carbonation. Light bitterness and eucalyptus hops in the finish.    A simple, straight forward IPA that covers all the bases. Not overpowering by any means but boasting a full array of hops. Worth a try, and would make a fantastic gateway IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Pours a slightly hazy golden-yellow with a foamy white head that retains well and leaves behind a good deal of lacing. Pine, citrus, and slightly dank hops. Solid aroma. Great citrus notes, with a little banana, clove, and malt base notes. It performs, but is a bit plain. Mouth feel is robust and filling. Great addition here. Easy and fun to drink. Overall, an IPA that hits the essentials. Nothing extraordinary, but just plain good.    Served in a 12oz snifter.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Sample is approximately 60 days post-bottling.    A: Clear. Color is dark gold to light copper.     S: Aroma is mild. Obviously hoppy, but not in your face. No malt detected.     T: Bitterness hits the tongue immediately. Hops lean towards resinous pine and dank notes. Not much citrus or fruit.     M: Carbonation is medium-low. Finishes thin.     O: It's a good bitter IPA. It lacks the punch of hop flavor and especially aroma i love in IPAs though. I'd drink it again but I don't know that I'd choose it over many other IPAs.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Drank from bottl.e    Can't speak much on looks, a basic bottle. Had to drink this after it fell out of fridge; thus lots of foam which left lacing. Clean looking.    Smells solely of fresh glorious hops.     Taste is typical of an american Ipa. It is fairly straightforward, not too full bodied, but crisp taste of piney hops throughout with a slight malt finish.     Pretty crisp, bitey from the hops, but nothing to back it up with. Feels like it needs something else for the feel.    Good, standard IPA.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 This one poured a very cool metallic orange with a thin foamy bone white head. The beer I poured appeared to be light on the carbonation as the bubbles were slowly streaming up the glass.    The smell was an average as of late IPA smell with a very strong floral hop forward smell with just a touch of some mustiness coming through.    Taste was a piny bitterness with a nice balance of the barley malts and hops.    Mouth feel was light with a crisp finish.    Overall this was a crisp and refreshing IPA that I could find myself purchasing again! Very easy drinking and easy drinking beer. At a 6.2 may not be exactly session-able but who gives a damn! As long as you live within walking distance you are cool my friend.

Head dissipates quickly; rings of lace left on glass.    Aroma: Pleasant spicy, hoppy nose. Some grapefruit and sap.    Taste: Great classic IPA flavors. Pine, citrus, grapefruit, spice, maybe tropical fruit. Good stuff.    Mouthfeel: Slightly thin body - very drinkable.    Overall: As good as everyone thinks it is. Maybe better.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.75 See the immediately referenced review for the contest between Lagunitas and Bells' IPA.  Basically, it is a draw.  Bell's balances their hops for a better after-taste.  Lagunitas uses so much of the citrus hops that it smells good, but its after-taste is too much to enjoy.    Re-rate 6/12/16 tasting: dropped .25 in Smell and Taste. Hops should be moderated before I will go back to this often.  2/8/17 tasting: not sought out, guest in someone else's house. Hops dry too much. No rating reduction.
