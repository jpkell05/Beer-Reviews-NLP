look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 I cellared this brew since fall 2016 and This Quad holds up to pour a nice rich slight hazy redish brown with a still very thick body tan head... that holds up with fairly nice lacing.  For the aroma...it has a nice slightly nutty/cherry fruit note to it and maybe a bit plum/prunes hint maybe on the burnt side tho.  Taste is also still up front and personal...with a mild edge with the fruity cherry/prune coming thru & a mild sweetness to it along with some mild funk & a slight roasty edge.  The feel follows the taste and I feel better with age...being on the edgey side, but maybe from the nice ABV & carbonation it has...that holds up thru-out that may give the edge as well.  All in all it is a very nice Belgian brew that I will continue to enjoy and cellar for years hopefully.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Look - 2 finger head from a 750ml bottle and to a Belgian glass. Deep brown with a slight ruby hue. Great head retention. Thick foam - nice Khaki color. Quite opaque, but not cloudy    Smell - Not very aromatic. Some Fig and Plum aroma. Some Belgian spice and yeast    Taste - Quick bite of booze up front. Sweet fruit rush in - cherry, prune, raisin. Some malt sweetness. There's an amazing Belgian richness (slight funk, spices, yeast, sharp tang). Sweetness and fruitiness fade, then the beer dries out and gets a roasty / slightly charred wood flavor    Feel - Medium + / Fairly full - Thick and a bit syrupy. Stasy fairly active throughout the entire bottle and doesn't totally flatten out    Overall - This is a very good Quad with cherry that is rich and flavorful. More cherry may have been a bit better. This one definitely got better as it warmed up. Strong Belgian yeast flavors and spices. Very happy with this one. Doesn't get much better than this.

F---A touch boozy, but not as much as the alcohol content would lead you to believe. Good carbonation. It feels like a serious beer.    O---Excellent offering from an excellent brewery. This is Wifey's single favorite beer. It's always in the rotation as a treat for both of us.

Dark deep rich maltiness with brown sugar, chocolate, and spices literally rises into the roof of your mouth. Transitions to some dark fruit, and alcoholic. Super smooth for 9.7%.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 12 oz bottle traded from Hinda65. Poured into Central Waters snifter.     Nice toffee caramel color, good balance of opacity and transparency, with an egg-foam yellow head of 2 fingers, falling to 1 finger and staying there.     Aroma is lots of caramel, sticky prune, mild chocolate and nutty notes, slight red grape notes.     Flavor is warming and boozy, with a good presence of hot caramel, dark cherry, fig, prune, raisin, nuts, and brown bread. A lot going on, but not really a focus on any one or two things.     Feel is a bit overcarbonated than I'd like for a Quad, with warming alcohol and a hot but not particularly drying finish.     Overall, a good but not great Quad. I'd like to see this barrel aged.

Experimented with a 4 year aged bottle (2014 vintage)    Pours murky brown with ample yeast sediment.    Aroma is of sweet malt, booze, and a bit of yeast. A little muted with age.    Taste is of a classic quad. Lots of dark fruits (figs and raisins). The beer is sweet. Borderline too much for the traditional style. Lots of honey, malt, and brown sugar. A little booze, tart cherry, and lemon peak through exciting the palate.    Overall, a good beer and one of the better American examples of the style. This did age significantly better than the sixth glass by boulevard. I see this pairing well with poached pears or filet with beef Demi glaze. It gets a 90/100.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 The 2013 vintage of Three Philosophers is a smooth, thick beer that tastes malty and somewhat like caramel. It is a lighter brown and has a soft, sweet smell to it (though thankfully isn't too sweet to the taste).   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Beautiful heavy head and nice dark brown color. Predominately molasses with a licorice hint. Very tasty and would definitely drink again. 
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 The Liefmans Kriek and the Belgian Quad blend produces quite a bold and interesting beer. Color is brown with dark red tinges, especially along the extreme edges. Head is average and a slightly pink off-white color. Aroma is full of yeast, cherries and light sweet bready malts. Taste is sweet yet has a nice carbonation from the blending of the Kriek. Cherry, alcohol, yeast are players and this is a fine yeasty and bready example of a quad. Finish is slightly sweet and has touches of banana and cherry   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Every I have this beer I like something different. Today its the complexity in the nose. Yesterday it was the complex blend of so many different tastes. Tomorrow it might be the way it enhances and works in harmony with the seafood appetizer. It wasn't made to overwhelm the senses, and it certainly wasn't made by a team of shy, withdrawn folks. Just a nicely balanced, well made beer that always satisfies.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Fairly good beer but for its reputation and name I was expecting more. Nice amber-brown color with some nice head and lingering lacing. Smells of sweet dark fruit. Tastes of ripe fruit, caramel, malt, grain and that yeast so indicative of this style. Smooth mild mouthfeel with some mild carbonation. A little too sweet and cloying for me without much complexity or bitterness to balance the sweetness. Alcohol taste is well-hidden though.

A friend from upstate ny introduced me to Ommegang many years ago and I’ve never been disappointed. Being a quadrupel, you expect a stronger beer with complex notes and flavor and this beer has all of that. I am not sure I understand the description above that includes a sour blend. I didn’t get that. I found it to be smooth and very indicative o& a quadrupel with one exception.. .it needed more carbonation. Delightfully enjoyable beer. My beer bottle label was brown and green, very different from above, but O probably just changed labels over the years. Prost

The beer pours bright reddish brown with light brown head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is ripe fruit, more cherry, and brown sugar. The taste is a wonderful mixture of barely tart cherry, caramel, dried fruit, and dark sugar. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium plus carbonation and mostly dry in the finish. There is no appreciable bitterness, but it's not cloying. Overall, excellent. This is a great beer. Recommended.

After a few sips and some warming up I start to see more appeal. It holds the high alvobol content well and does start to display a bit of heartiness.    F: The first sip hit all up front and didn't maintain any structure to the back of the palette. Finish is weak and not noteworthy. It does wotk better as it warmed up a bit    O: It is ok. probably not worth going back to as there are other options at this price that have more appeal to me.

T - Brown sugar and oversteeped tea to start, bread and honey in the center, and a trailing bitter bite in the close.    M - Moderate carbonation, slightly sticky on the tongue, but a scrubbing dry finish keeps the palate clean.    O - Delicious punchy Quad, with lots of great flavor notes, and a well-integrated whole. Superb.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A) Pours an opaque mahogany with traces of red here and there. Decent tan head recedes quickly, leaving little lacing.    S) Sweet, malty, and somewhat sharp. The smell of cherries is a bit hidden beneath the stronger scents of malt, spices, and booze, but it's certainly there. A very pleasant, inviting smell.    T) Bready and sweet at first, followed by cherries and a slight hint of alcohol. The final notes are not unlike a fine port wine. Each successive sip sees a new flavor brought to the fore, and the interplay between all of them is fantastic.    M) Not quite thin, but very smooth. The carbonation helps the sharper components of the beer prick at the tongue, providing an enlivening combination of sensations. The feel fits perfectly with the rest of the beer.    O) A wonderful quad that I would buy again a lot sooner if it weren't $11 a bottle. Its quality cannot be doubted, but this is one that will have to remain as a rare treat for someone without an abundance of money to spend on beer.

The crown is bubbling vigorously for about a minute until it calms down and completes into a very dense, tightly formed land of very small bubbles.   The smell is cherries with some esters. Some banana as well. Almost like a banana cherry milkshake.   The taste is very much the same. Beautiful cherries mix well with banana notes.   The feeling is well carbonated making the cherries bounce. Slightly tart from the cherries as well.   Overall, good representation of the style. I like it a lot.

The head is two fingers, dense, foamy and khaki colored. This is my first Quad so I'm not sure about retention for the style, but after about a minute all that was left is a 1/4 inch ring around the edge of the glass. There are a few filmy chunks of lacing left on the glass.    Smell is very nice. Sweet and tart cherry, raisins, caramel, molasses, brown sugar and a touch of spice. Complex and not overly sweet.    Taste is similar, but a bit more sweet. The finish in particular is very heavy on the sweet caramel, but the cherries hold their own and help round it out throughout most of the sip.    Feel is medium bodied and slightly sticky with prickly carbonation.    Overall this is a very enjoyable beer. By the end of the glass it became a touch too sweet for me (not sure if that's just the beer or par for the style) but I still really liked it.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 L — Pours a ruby-hued amber body with a two-finger light tan head produced with moderate pour. The head is very fizzy and dissipates incredibly quickly for the style. Zero retention or lacing	  S — Sweet cherry, caramel, doughy malt, banana, honey. The cherry character is on the verge of being cough syrupy	  T — Banana bread, toffee, cherry, roast, clove, and a touch of yeasty bitterness	  F — Mouthfeel is somewhat fluffy and has a prickly carbonation. Slightly astringent on the tail end	    82/100

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Nice deep opaque color with a slight tan head that settles to a ring with slight cap. The nose is not the highlight of this beer with a malty and slightly sweet scent with some slight dark fruits on the edge. Flavor is nice, smooth with slight caramel malts, dark fruits and some sweet and bitter on the end. These flavor blend to almost create a red wine type flavor. This beer has less carbonation and a medium thick feel. Alcohol is pretty well hidden for the high ABV. Decent quad here. May be a bit better than the parts that make it up.

The oldest is very very mellow, mostly sweet raisin taste , not so much yeast or cherry flavor ..     From there they basically get a brighter fresher flavor with more pronounced fresh cherry flavor..     The 2013 is my favorite , these (like all quads I'm sure) are great beers to age.. I would say another couple years easily .   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 An absolutely phenomenal offering from a phenomenal brewery. Eclipsed only by one other of their masterpieces.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Smell is caramel, slight peach. Taste is caramel, brown sugar and malt up front. pepper behind. Smallest amount of fruit. Alcohol is up front. Great balance of caramel and malt.

Nice dark caramel color, a light boozy taste to go with a medium body and some carbonation of note. I enjoyed the caramel notes, hints of nutmeg, and even some spice. A very good beer with a very good foundation, certainly will look for these moving forward.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A - Dark hazy pour, good finger or so of head that sticks around.   S - Full of spices and cherries. I won't be surprised if it ends up tasting a kriek than a quad.  T - Just like the nose, full of nice spices, dark fruit, and a lot of cherry. It verges on sweet, but not quite.  M - Medium bodied with med/high carb. Excellent mouthfeel.  O - Yep, I feel like it's a kriek by a different name. No matter, I really like this beer. Very well blended. I see that other people did not like this as much as I did, but my palate is less sensitive so I think flavors get muted to the point that I find them pleasing. Get more for sure.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 The beer is bottle conditioned, so naturally it is a little hazy. In terms of smell it is spice and cherry. It is a blend of quadrupel and cherry kriek so that is understandable. It is definitely a sipping beer. In terms of taste a get a little spice, banana, prune, and a lot of cherry, it is too much cherry for my liking. It feels like it should. Overall, it doesn't quite feel balanced to me. I can pick apart the blend and both are really good, however to me it leans too much towards the kriek.

I can catch a buzz and read about these guys. Good stuff.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; no production information.  A: Pours a hazy to cloudy copper color with modest clearing to an initially one inch, tan head. Retention good, minimal spotty lacing.  S: Aromas of molasses, plum, spice (mostly cloves), and rum, but in a complex melange that is well blended and distinct. Maybe a little grainy at the end.  T: the flavor of cloves predominates against the malty backbone. A cherry note is appreciable but subtle and nice. Bitterness present and a nice counterpoint to the malt.  M: Medium to full bodied. Very good carbonation leaving a tingling on the tongue and palate. Alcohol appreciable, but not overpower.  O: Really an inviting, complex Quad. I alway have reservations about fruit additives (outside of say lambics and Berliner Weisse style beers), because I find they often impart sourness to the beer that subtracts from the experience, but here I do think it really delivered. A somewhat different take on the style, clearly, but also definitely a well designed, well crafted one. Kudos! Would certainly drink/serve/gift.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 So many people love this beer. First quad I've had.  Looks dark Amber to brown with a thick creamy head.  Smells like dark fruits and leathery.  Tastes sweet like cherry up front (kriek added) then gradually fades to a darker burned prune or molasses.   Feels fluffy and fuzzy. Someone else described it as dancing in the mouth and I would agree.  Overall very interesting. I would like to try more quads.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Interesting Belgian-style quadrupel from Ommegang. Strong sour cherry notes from sour cherry ale. Lighter in color and taste than some other quadrupels I've had. Does not taste boozy despite the 9.5%. A nice quadrupel, particularly if you like cherries, but not an outstanding one.

The addition of the cherry ale adds nicely to its complexity with a background of very dark chocolate dipped cherries and cherry stones.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 One of the best beers I have ever tried. As a fan of Ommegang, this selection is a home run. The taste and nose match up very well. The palate was about a medium. A great beer to enjoy slowly and you will notice a sweet cherry aftertaste and a dry finish. I did not get much of a spice in the aroma but for me, I got a cherry and leathery experience. Great balance, wonderful color. A must try for Quad fans.   
look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.5 Ommegang is a fine brewery and this is a complex one. Make sure to serve this one properly and be mindful of your palette. After properly airing and coming down a bit in temperature, this beer tasted great. After some salt organic nachos, not so much, but in the same sitting the taste transformed after eating some hearty stew. Suddenly the cherry notes were abundant.     Hard to say if this was the finest quad I've had, but one thing is for certain, it keeps getting better after every sip.

S) The nose is very strong on biscuit, currant, and a smidgen of molasses. Very pleasant, although I would prefer it stronger in a quad.    T) Everything in the nose is in the taste, with the addition of dark cherry, honey. and a tinge of roastiness. It is quite rich, but well balanced.    F) It has a medium carbonation, and a full-bodied mouthfeel. Not insanely silky.    O) Solid quad and the cherries are quite detectable. Would recommend.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 A bit of a disappointment. I had one of these a couple years ago and recall liking it more then. I don't know if IT changed or if I changed.    It's good! Not memorably good, but good. Dark brown appearance and a delicate aroma, meaning not a whole lot to smell. I do get mild cherry notes... and alcohol.    Flavor is similar. A tad sour, but not off-putting. Carbonation is on the heavy side - a little too tickly.    I might give this a try again, but won't go out of my way to look for it.

Aroma - Spice forward, cherry, leathery and mineral-like.  Taste - Sugary up front, toast and caramel notes, cherries are present and lightly tart, finish has a bit of spice and very faint cocoa powder.  Feel - Medium bodied, ample carbonation, a small amount of alcohol warmth.    Overall - A fair bit lighter than most quads I've had but enjoyable.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured medium into a fifteen ounce mug the same temperature as the beer. Pours a reddish brown with small caramel head that lasts. Hazy to opaque. Sticky lacing. Some legs.     Blast of cherry and sweet malts on the nose with an underlying whiff of apricot. Alcohol. Prune?    Taste follows the nose closely. First up is a mixture of cherries and sweet malt. Followed by apricot and dark fruit. Again the prune. Hardly any bitterness at all. The hops are there but not a major flavor component. Boozy.    Creamy smooth mouthfeel with some warming alcohol on the palate. Sweet in the beginning. Ends sweet as well.  Definitely hits the Quad mark. A very complex brew. Extremely hard to review. I'll have another go with this later. Cheers!!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a chalice.  The appearance was a dark brown body with light edges near the bottom, one finger foamy off-white head with some light clingy lacing that eventually spider webs a bit. The smell had cherries up front with plums, sugar, Belgian yeast, malts, light booze really faint in the background, cherries continue to dominate as the beer warms. The taste was sweet through all of the previously mentioned flavors and combined eloquently together. The palate was about a medium, not sessionable - good sipper over a period of time, sticky sweet cherry aftertaste and a dry finish. Overall, one of my all time favorite quads brewed by an American brewer.

Poured into a snifter from the 750 ml bottle. This fine ale pours a deep and moderately murky  ruby tinged brown with a fantastic head of pale tan foam that subsides to a thick ring, thick layer,  and showcases some nice sudsy lacing. Nose of brown sugars, rich cherries, leather, dark fruit notes   of raspberry, and strong phenol alcohol. Flavors hit the perfect notes with warming cherry and brandy   notes touched with raisin and raspberry flavors that are steeped in brown sugars and finishing  with a subtle flowery hop flavor mingling with leather and tobacco notes. Excellent medium body,   lightly slick warming middle, medium high lively carbonation, and a lightly tart and subtly dry finish  with warming booze.    An excellent example of the style done right---rich, layered, warming, and inviting. A SERIOUS ale  drinkers find.     Cheers

It pours a clear, dark brown with red highlights. Nice head with 2 fingers of tan head that settles into a cap after two minutes.    Smell: Layered and medium-strong in intensity. Malt-forward with notes of caramel, milk chocolate, dark fruit (raisins and plums), almonds (amaretto-ish), cherries, bready/toasty pale malts, and yeast funk. Moderate alcohol presence.    Taste: Delicious and complex. Strong and sweet with a faint tartness. The malts and esters dominate the palate. Notes of dark fruit (raisins and plums), caramel, bready/toasty pale malts, cherries, and banana. Some subtle floral and earthy hop-character. The finish is long and well-balanced.    Feel: Medium body with lively carbonation. Creamy with significant alcohol warming and prickliness. Medium-dry and mildly astringent. The mouthfeel had me swishing the beer around for an extra few seconds.    Overall: An all-around fabulous beer that steps slightly out of the box. Complex and malty-rich displaying excellent craftsmanship. Definitely worth a try as it is an absolute pleasure to drink.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Look- Very gentle pour yields a huge tan soapy head that recedes to about 1 finger and never quite goes away. soapy lace coats the glass after each sip. Liquid is a beautiful opaque deep amber    Aroma- light cherry up front followed by prunes, sweet figs and a little booze.    Taste- starts with the figs and prunes then some tart cherry sneaks in at the end. A slight booziness is there too.     Feel- on the light side of medium, very soft and smooth    Overall- this is a nice sipper that improves as it approaches room temperature. The flavors really start to intensify as it warms. Very complex flavors, yet nothing is overwhelming or too in your face. Put together very well.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured 12oz bottle into snifter glass. 9.7% abv    Appearance- Pours a rich mahogany, nearly black once in the glass. Opaque. Light brown head with course bubbles, quick to dissipate.    Smell- Plum, licorice; dark fruit aromas. Notes of toffee and molasses as well.    Taste- Plum with hints of grapes. Sugary as well, candy like but not overpowering. Cherry tartness progressively builds. Cherry notes abound through the finish which ends a bit bitter with a clove spiciness.    Mouthfeel- Heavy in body. Medium carbonation. Boozy.    Overall- An outstanding quad. Hits the dark fruit notes just right, sweet but not too sweet. The cherry addition really compliments the plum/grape/licorice subtleties.

Best before 03/10/2021 and served slightly below cellar temperature.    Pours a clear, deep-hued amber, taking on a considerably redder tinge when held to the light. The two fingers of loose, soapy, off white-coloured head generated require a few minutes to melt down to a creamier-looking cap and collar about half as high. A classy-looking glass of beer. The nuances of the aroma are subtle, and challenging to identify with specificity - boozy, overripe dark fruit (mostly cherry) is the closest I can muster, with a fair amount of sweet demerara sugar in there, too. Plum, fig, raisin and spicy yeast add depth beyond the cherry - it's a warming, inviting aroma, and the temptation to take a sip is difficult to resist.    Just a superb sipper all around. Candi sugar sweetness is a consistent presence from the start, as a mélange of dark fruit flavours excites the taste buds. Of course, cherry is the most prominent culprit - imparting a subtly tart quality that helps to blunt the saccharinity of the base quad - but I'm also getting hints of raisin, plum, and rich date sweetness by mid-sip, as well as suggestions of banana esters. The spiciness of the yeast begins to assert itself towards the finish, mostly in the form of clove, while a mild dusting of earthy, herbal hops simultaneously settles upon the palate - up until the ethanol starts to warm (and eventually numb) it up. Boozy, fruity, yeasty aftertaste that lingers. Medium-full in body, with sharp carbonation that seems unnecessarily aggressive and, at times, foamy.     Final Grade: 4.25, an A-. Ommegang's Three Philosophers is truly satisfying to sip, and that's good enough for me. The underlying quad is satisfactory, but the kriek blend is what really cements it as a quality Belgian dark ale. The mouthfeel is probably the weakest aspect, but all in all this is still a high quality beer that I highly recommend. Probably the best North American quad I've tried to date - and while I'd still say that all of the top-tier Trappist imports handily outperform it, Three Philosophers is at least well within the vicinity of that same hallowed ballpark. I'll definitely be grabbing a second bottle for the cellar.

Not that there's anything wrong with a sweet quadrupel, but this style succeeds magnificently in itself. The flavours are definitely in line with good Belgian examples of the styles. The carbonation doesn't taste quite as 'bottle-conditioned' as the Belgian quadrupels I'm used to - maybe they gave it a bit of a head start? Regardless, this is a top-tier beer in my book, and if I didn't rate this a 5, I don't know what beers I _could_ give a 5 to.

Aroma: Probably one of the best smelling Quads I've ever had the pleasure of sampling. Lots of red licorice and candied plums. Tamarind, peat smoke, rye bread, banana, clove, dates and figs.    Flavor: At first I tasted this chilled, the taste was a little muted so I had to let it warm up.     Served at room temp, this beer really opens up. I'm getting lots of fruit, like red figs, dates, raisins, plums, tamarind, apples, cherries, cranberries... even pomegranate. There are also delicious tones of red licorice candy throughout.    Restrained yet complex notes of caramel and chocolate dance in the background, as well as yeasty belgian flavors of banana, clove, bubblegum and white pepper... it's understated but provides an excellent contrast to the sweetness of the fruit.    Feel: Creamy, heady and smooth. Dry and estery; sweet but balanced by a mild floral character. Heavy body with low carbonation. Alcohol is there, but you will only notice it once if you really search for it.    Overall: This is one you really want to take your time with and sip over the course of an hour or so. It's so complex and decadent you don't want miss a beat.

You can see it in all these BA positive reviews. 3 Philos is a crisp, tasty, complex brew with a nice head and lace that lasts. The kriek imparts a subtle dry bit of cherry to the flavor that adds to a unique Quad. Unlike any I've tasted. And the high ABV never shouts at you. Ommegang scores again.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 I don't know for sure, but I have this feeling that reviewers tend to rate a non traditional beer market's attempt at a traditional beer without direct comparison. So for example, here is an American attempt at a Belgian style and wow, that is pretty good for a US attempt, so 4.25. As I said, I don't have proof of this but I have read that type of review and I must say that it is rather unhelpful.   Allow me to compare this to St. Bernardus, Rochefort or Westvleteren and no, this one is not even close. Of course elements are there, of course it is a fantastic attempt but this is not among the great Quadrupels, no matter how we want it to be. It is strong and yet watery, missing the full body and all its intricacies.   It is absolutely worth a try, but for me here in Toronto, why would I pay the same amount (for an extremely limited time at that) for something that costs as much as St. Bernardus (available year 'round)? That would be ridiculous.  So if Three Philosophers is all you can fetch in this style, go for it, this is decent. If you have access to the real deal, don't bother after an initial trial.

Caramel malt and toffee sweetness followed by some yeasty baked bread.    Finishes dry and chewy with a good amount of carbonation. Excellent blend of flavours making an interesting but excellent take on the style.

He told me it would make me happy about the state of American independent brewing again. He was right. The added 2% blend of cherry ale in this amazing blend won me over right away--and so began my infatuation, nay, obsession, with Belgian style ales. Thank you Ommegang!

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a single-serve bottle    Look--The classic dark strong look. Murky brown with ruby tinting. An initial two-finger head with khaki mottling that quickly dissipates to a persistent sticky lacing.    Smell--The phenols and alcohol are perhaps a bit stronger than I would have liked. Not off-putting, but somewhat strong compared to the "standard" of the style.    Taste--A rich blend of spice, anise, dark fruits, and a boozy/dry finish (most likely the kriek coming through). Not as malty-caramely as typically found in the style, but again, not offputting. Perhaps a bit too medicinal, however.    Feel--The carbonation does not personally bother me, but this is too carbonated to be true to the style.     Overall--I've yet to be let down by Ommegang's takes on the Belgian styles. This is a nice American take on the Belgian dark strong. It doesn't measure up to the "originals," but for the price and pedigree, it is excellent. I would compare favorably to a Sixth Glass or other superior American version of the Quad.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 An excellent value! Imports are hard to come by in the UP, and I'm glad to have found some domestic craft brews that get the job (well) done. Three Philosophers is one of my standbys. It runs for about $16 for a four pack 'round these parts. If I could be functional while drunk, I'd drink this all day, every day!    Pour: Deep reddish brown with a thick tan head  Aroma: Yeasty and fruity  Flavor: Heavily roasted malt with a hint of fruit and sweetness. I also get some caramel and toffee    Frequently poured into a tulip glass.

There's some nice silky lacing on the glass with every sip, but it doesn't stick around very long.  Smell - cherries, dark fruits, clove, bready malts, and some notes of brown sugar and booze.  Taste - cherries and raisins are strongest, but these flavors are rounded out with a sweet malt backbone and a touch of booze.  Feel - great carbonation, chewy body, rich and smooth finish.

Smell: It has a high level of fruit with includes raisins, fig, and dried cherries. There is also a rich, bready malt aroma as well.     Taste: There are additional flavors of spice and alcohol. There are high fruit flavors blended with rich malt. The fruit flavors include raisins, plums, figs, and dried cherries. The malt is mostly bread. There is also a moderate level of spice and some alcohol.     Feel: It has a moderate feel to it with a high level of carbonation. It has a moderately high level of bitterness with some alcohol warming.     Overall this is a complex blended beer with the fruit flavors blending well with the malt and spices.

Little bit of yeast floating around. Hazy hue.     S - Cherries, raisins, licorice, hint of pinot noir     T - crushed cherries, hint of cask, licorice, molasses, cranberry skin, watermelon Cabbage Patch Kids    F - thin body, smooth drinking, little bit of the booze side. No booze lingering, fruity at best.     O - this is a delicious beer. Not into the Belgians much but this one brought me back into the fold. Not dark and strong, but the blend of Kriek gives a nice tart and fruity taste around the strong malt and booze background. Must have for any beer geek. Cheers!

Look: Dark brown with reddish hues around the edges of my glass. Thick and lasting head.    Smell: Deep fruit, hints of malt and an anise tail.    Taste: Much bolder than the aroma. Same flavors as the aroma with the addition of a slightly sour note.    Feel: Thick, slightly creamy with a sight alcohol bite.    Overall: I am very impressed with this brew. Yet another in the great line of beers this company produces, even if they are slightly over-marketed.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 The cork popped quite loudly, so was prepared for a foam fountain on the pour, but not so much. The liquid is a red/brown almost mahogany color with a dense tan head that subsided quickly. There was some lacing, but not much. About 1/8 inch of foam persisted.    Smell - felt it a little weak for such a big beer. Cherry with a whiff of vinegar, yeasty, a brown sugar/molasses component, sweetness, and it stops.    Taste - much bigger taste. It is very wine or cognac like in character. Clearly fruity with the cherry kriek, but ever so slightly sour balanced by a moderate level of sweetness. A bit of peppery spice on the finish, breadiness from the malt. As I drank more, it seemed go further into the wine/cognac experience.    Feel - a little hot kick from the alcohol, a bit tingly on the carbonation. Seemed to feel think initially, but actually ended up quite thin, so will go with a medium body. A bit dry but not overly so.    Overall, this is an enjoyable beer that is worth trying at least once.

The bottle image is also different. This is my first review and if I can upload a current bottle photo I will. Overall, one of my new favorites. This review comes from one who's base and all time favorite beer is Bass Ale.

I found the taste to be a bit bland, but that might be the actual reason I enjoyed it so much.

Taste is super sweet, hints of chocolate, grape, and the with warmth alcohol. Mouthfeel syrupy with bubbles and tingles all over despite being very lightly carbonated. Finishes malty and sweet with residual fruit remaining on the palate. A fine example of a Belgian style.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 (single bottle, purchased last week off a room temp shelf - 2015 on neck label... poured into a teku glass)    L: crystal-clear liquid, beautiful shade of ruby... some foam builds on the pour but crumbles into a sad, spit-y collar... gave final mark because of the gorgeous color... final pour dumps in a light sediment dust, neither adds nor detracts    S: powdery cherry bubblegum, moderate port-like booze... perhaps some chocolate malt poking through... suggestion of a thick, almost syrupy sweetness, however, against the other aromas it's not a potential outlying flaw, one can understandably anticipate boozy richness... subtle hint of banana peel later    T: the core is surely thick malt/sugar, highlighted by a sharply-spicy, phenolic, perfumy-alcohol, which along with the fruit skin aftertaste, seems to cut any depth or definition in the malt - so the malt, though thick, candyish and wort-like, comes off rather bland and arguably one-dimensional... little bit of chocolate and cherry (w/ pit) essence in the aftertaste...     F: medium-thick wave up front, whoosh of moderately-hot booze follows, mostly glassy finish with less residual matter than expected... so it ends up being slightly top-heavy, weightless, and dry (and sort of altogether dull)... could use a bit more warmth toward the back (instead of 'tween my side teefs)... based on drag, one could drink as many as 3-4 in a row and not slouch... I wouldn't protest a higher rating on this element, but it does end up feeling flat    O: I've had this a handful of times over the years - it always leaves a little to be desired, for me, primarily in the malt department... for the blend it is, it's not necessarily bad (it's still one of the better domestic quads I've had), but I'm quite curious to try the quad part by itself, not that it gives the impression of matching the quality and character of say a La Trappe or Abt 12    (EDIT - bumped up grades on 27 Sep 2018 tasting of 2017 bottle, poured into a snifter)

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 I have Had this quad with many desserts ranging from very chocolate cake to dark fruit pies to bitter-sweet chocolate chunks and too much in-between. Three Philosophers goes well with rich desserts.   I also bought a 4 pack with the intention of having one a winter since Three Philosophers improves with age, carbonation mellows and the fruity flavors meld.    6/6/17 Had the 4th bottle of a 2015 4-pack... one and a half years ahead of schedule. The 4th was the best. The high carbonation modified and didn't try to steal the show from the dessert. The quad's cherry played nice with the strawberry/rhubarb pie. And I was happy. Now, if I would just pace myself...

The towering head quickly recedes to a thin ring. Lacing is absent.  S-The beer smells of caramel, charr, and alcohol. Just behind the initial wiff, the faintest hint of the kriek's cherries can be detected.  T-The taste is similar to the nose, with the cherries being slightly stronger in the taste vs the nose. The cherries get stronger as the beer warms, but never become the dominant flavor. They serve to take some of the alchohol edge off the beer as well as toning down the charr. Overall the kriek added to the beer has made it easier drinking than I was expecting for a quad.  F- The carbonation is prickly, but not overly strong for the style. The mouthfeel is thinner than I was expecting.  O-A good, but not great beer that I'm glad I tried. Still it's probably not something I would shell out the cash for again.

Spicy, sweet, and savory, this beer offers some stone fruit, fig, nutmeg, peaty scotch, licorice, bubblegum, and all sorts of other cool things on the nose. So much going on! The taste is similar, but with a few more sweet notes than expected. Can't tell if the 1.5 years of aging in my cellar has made it better or not, but it's a glorious beer no matter when you drink it. And yeah, you can definitely taste those cherries. Smooth and refeshing enough that it doesn't just make you thirstier when you drink it, and it can even pair well with salty foods, which I normally recommend with paler ales - impressive considering it's close to 10% abv.

Pours with a beautiful ruby hue. Excellent malt nose with pleasant, modest cherry and caramel taste. The 2015 seemed lighter vs. previous years, particularly 2012, 2013..but I did pick this bottle up at bulk commercial store in Florida named Total Wine...have enjoyed controlled pours at beer venues that tasted much better.  Overall, I have consumed this beer many times and it never disappoints.

Tastes herbal to medicinal with cherry pit/skin flavors. Some yeastiness, earth and slight spice and herbal character before getting a solvent feel in the finish.    This is medium in body with modest carbonation. A solid brew but starting to show its age.

My other experiences with Ommegang were fantastic and Cooperstown is fairly close. Popped the cork and took a sniff. Smelled fruity and sweet and poured darker than you'd expect just from the smell. Taste of fruit and some malt, maybe caramel. The sweetness of the fruit is more subtle when tasting but it was very carbonated which I loved! If I had the money I'd sip on this 24/7. Definitely recommend to those like me who are newer to craft beer.

The smell is cherries, yeast, caramel, honey and a sour smell from the cherries that is vaguely reminiscent of vinegar. The taste is sweet and peppery. There is bread, cherries and caramel along with the sour that was present in the nose. The beer finishes with a tart bitterness. The beer has a medium mouthfeel and a decent amount of carbonation that stings the tongue slightly.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Found a bottle from 2010 in my liquor cabinet. Chilled it and opened it today 1/2/2016. This is a seriously complex beer. A ton going on from the spicy opening through to the almost sour finish. This is a beer to be savored as it changes as it warms and oxidizes. This reminds me of almost of a prosecco with the grape overtones but the alcohol reminder at the end elicits a nice warm fuzzy that will keep you coming back until the bottle is empty. I do not know how often I would drink this but I am particularly happy I am doing it now. Consider this a beer you should try at least once. I am very interested in how a fresher one would present.

I've been wowed by their double, but this Quad is more difficult to embrace. Wonderful color and nose. A very malty taste with funky layers of spice and nut. Maybe its the strength, or the warmth it creates, or perhaps Three Philosophers is too deep a beer to contemplate on a hectic New Year's Eve. It is worthy of further study and I do have one more.

As I drank the beer, the body color became more red over time (most likely due to more light going into the beer). The head is a creamy brown that started as one finger width and slowly reduced to a thin film.    S: Amazingly fruity yeast aroma full of cherry, plum, raisin, dark malt, caramel, and spices like cinnamon and allspice. I wish I could rate it higher than a five, it's that good.    T: Starts with spicy malt and caramel, then transitions to tart dark fruits, and ends with an alcoholic kick.    F: Medium / full bodied and really foamy with medium carbonation. There is some warmth as it rolls across the tongue.

This is an excerpt from a review below that describes the taste exactly as I tasted it.    this beer is quite nutty and the dominant flavor profile is malty. It has a medium-full body that definitely doesn't leave you wanting more body, which is to say there is something in this glass that your tongue can get a good grip on. It is moderately carbonated with a light hint of cocoa, and after a swig, there is a noticeable but unhindering amount of bitterness that rests on the back of the tongue.     However, the bitterness was too much for me to handle. Absolutely awful. Ruined the rich mouth feel and malty/chocolate notes. Could be a great beer if I grab an previous year's bottle.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Pours either a dark auburn color with some real red highlights that shine through the edges. A smooth khaki colored head resolves itself back into the beer fairly quickly.    Aroma is of wood, cedarwood predominantly, alcohol, tart cherries, and red cabernet wine.    The flavor reminds me much more of wine than it does anything else. Red wine, most likely either cabernet sauvignon or pinot noir. I'm not a big wine person so I'm not sure which one to call it. Alcohol is present in the flavor, as is some kind of grain. Occasionally has a slightly bready aftertaste. Oak, or some other kind of wood is also present. In fact, the flavor profile here is mostly oak, alcohol, and red wine. The flavor REALLY has a strong barrel-aged or oak-aged presence, yet I don't see that noted anywhere on the beer's label so I'm assuming it's not. Hard to imagine.    I just don't think this is my favorite style. If you have a significant other who loves their wine and you're trying to sway them to the other side, this would be a lovely introduction beer for that person.

The beer pours with moderate head, releasing a nutty aroma. Upon whiffing the beer, A malty sweetness with a mild toasty scent was noticeable. Sitting in the glass, the beer is copper red with low-medium head retention.     Authors note: One of our expert tasters is dealing with allergies at the time of this review.    Eric believes he can taste the high abv. What isn't up for debate is that this beer is quite nutty and the dominant flavor profile is malty. It has a medium-full body that definitely doesn't leave you wanting more body, which is to say there is something in this glass that your tongue can get a good grip on. It is moderately carbonated with a light hint of cocoa, and after a swig, there is a noticeable but unhindering amount of bitterness that rests on the back of the tongue.

Murky coppery brown color with a thick beige head with decent retention and leaving a constant plate.  Delicious aroma with notes of chocolates in creamy, dark and cocoa forms, cherries, lots of nuts, figs, raisins and plums.  Similarly, flavor with notes of chocolates, cocoa, sour cherries, prunes, cloves, cinnamon, peppery yeast, toasted and roasted malts, grapes, orange marmalade, earthy and herbal hops, figs, wood and candied sugar. Dry and bitter aftertaste.  Medium bordering full rich body with appropriate carbonation. Alcohol of 9.7% is well disguised.  Quad with excellent malt and fruity complexity. Perfectly executed. It did not feel heavy despite of style and alcohol, but also did not feel as rich as the top traditional references. Recommendable.

F- on the thin side, but still very hard to drink. that may have been because of the taste though.    I did not enjoy this beer. First bomber I've ever had to just dump out part of (more than half).

Gotta get on that. Nonetheless...    Appearance: Pours a somewhat hazy brown color that really isn't all that pretty. There is a faint copper tinge to the beer, but nothing astounding. The head is off-white bordering on dishwater brown.    Smell: Dates, raisins, currants, prunes, molasses, sour cherry, and alcohol    Taste: Very similar to the nose. The cherry flavors are not as prevalent as I would have imagined based on other reviews or the description. There is definitely a soft, tart cherry presence to the beer but it is by no means the main note of the beer. Flavor notes include sweet dates, banana esters, brown sugar, honey wheat bread, cherry, and a faint booziness. The booziness is noticeable but not overpowering or astringent.    Mouthfeel: Medium-high body.    Overall: A great beer from Ommegang and one that I will anxiously try again. I doubt bottle format will matter at all, but I would like to split a bomber of this with someone just to see if there are noticeable differences over the 12oz bottle I had. Recommended.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 The Quad style is not one I am not massively familiar with. I've been keen to delve in so here goes. Three Philosophers pours a deep brown-amber mix with a light redness in there, looks like it should hold a mosquito being used for dna samples in a Jurassic Park franchise movie. It is a seriously fine looking beer. The aroma has a waft of sherry in there. Carbonation is fast and bulbous, tight also. Enjoying the cherry and fig notes that come through as this beer warms. English bonfire toffee and an element of clove come through. The complexity is outstanding, each sip opening something new up, much like listening to one of your favorite Kraftwerk albums on vinyl. The high ABV does not so much give you a burn as much as a warming sense. I wish I had a fireplace to enjoy this next to but to be honest I would drink this anywhere. Top notch.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Ruddy brown with a finger of tan head. Somewhat muted aroma of cherries, dates and clove. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Same flavors as the nose, with cherry the most prevalent without being over-powering. There's a fair amount of hop bitterness for the style, as well as some warming alcohol and red wine and sherry notes. While not as complex as the Trappist quads, it does have a very nice creamy, medicinal cherry aftertaste.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This is a great quad. I wouldn't rank it with the standard bearers of the genre such as Abt 12 or Rochefort 10 but this is damn tasty.     Poured from a 12 oz bottle, with a formidable fingers worth of tan head atop a hazy dark brown/bronze body.     Belgian candied sugar on the nose as well as cherry and a bit of something like dates. Flavor follows suit, but brings additional yeast esters and a spiciness that is really pleasant. Mouthfeel is full, the sweetness definitely comes through. Again not quite as rich and lavish as an Abt 12 but this is still great. Recommended.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This was poured into a chalice.  The appearance was a dark hazy brown to dark purple color with a nice one finger white level foamy head that dissipated within less than about a minute. Light lacing spider webbed nicely.  The smell was full of cherries, had a light apple aroma, Belgian sweet malts, an ample amount of Belgian spices and a light cocoa flavor underneath.  The taste was blended nicely between the sweetness and the spiciness. There's the lingering sweet to spicy Belgian aftertaste.  The mouthfeel had about a medium body with that back of the throat tightness gripping my tongue I normally associate with quads. I'm not exactly sure if I described that well to anyone reading this, but I think it might be somewhat hard to explain.  Overall, with my lack of word knowledge, I might want to use the word "throaty" in the mouthfeel, maybe that's what I meant. Other than that, I still liked this one and would have it again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 2014 bottle, poured into goblet at a warmish room temp: This quad/cherry ale blend is a good combo. Deep, clear ruby/brown color with a persistent tan head. Boozy smell tends to overpower the other aromas, but isn't overpowering itself. Malty, wine, & quiet cherry the major flavors. Would like a heftier body, but the medium heft is smooth. Overall, it's a taste quad blend with a distinct wine profile that bears repeating.

A: Classic quad aromas, dark fruits like raisins, some sweetness and tartness, caramel, toffee, picking up a lot of booze, smells pretty good.    T: Like the nose, raisin notes with some sweetness and a hint of tartness, not as sweet as the nose, black grape forward, hint of the Belgian yeast, finishes with lots of raisin like characteristics and dry.     M: Medium body with a very dry almost wine like finish.    O: Not as impressive as other quads, lacks complexity, picking up a lot of raisin like notes, Belgian yeast does not come through as strong as I expected, and I got lots of booze. I'm wondering how this might age. A good solid representation of the style.

S - Caramel, booze, and some unknown tartness. A foreshadowing of what was to come.    T - An immediate wave of delicious Belgian caramel malts hits hard, a multi-faceted web of caramelly flavors, followed by an increasingly intense yeast character, mainly of phenols and solventlike esters. Then, on the back, comes this oh-so subtle tartness, accompanied by a quiet sweetness from the kriek.    M - Nice and creamy, just as dry as you'd want from an ale like this.    O - Has a similar character to the classic Belgian quads, but with an added complexity from the kriek and incredibly powerful yeast character.

The finish is a quick hit of yeast sourness lingering.    Feel: quite smooth and almost dangerously easy to drink.

Little lacing. Nose was of light malt and cherry like the old safety lollipops. Initial sweet malt with cherry on the end and almost no hop kick. Toffee and a bit of pepper in the mix. Carbonation was a bit crisp at first but mellowed later . . . or perhaps that was me mellowing. Feel was a bit thick for me. This is a very filling beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 355 ml bottle served fairly cold into a Amsterdam Bonehsaker snifter. Purchased while in the US a few weeks ago.    Appearance - a dark, hazy, muddy brown coloured beer is poured. Topped by a finger and a half of tan head, it doesn't last too long before coalescening into a small thin layer of foam that rests on top of the beer. A little sediment rests in the bottom of the glass.    Smell - butterscotch comes to mind right away. Some caramel, vanilla and maybe marshmallows too. Then the cherries bring up the rear while a subtle but steady fruity aroma. Delicious and complex.    Taste - cherries up front, cherries in the rear. A little treacle on the aftertaste with the caramel and butterscotch flavours mingled in with the cherries in the middle. Really tasty and really refined. Reminds me of a slightly different Chimay Blue with the steady cherry presence.    Mouthfeel - smooth and fairly light for a quad, nice soft carbonation, and the booze is reasonably well hidden, drinks more like a 8% ABV beer than one nearing 10%.    Overall - absolutely top notch beer here, a great quad that stands up with the best of the class, very delightful and relatively light with a huge cherry base. Really enjoyable and while pricey, worth the treat once in a while.

A good looking brew.   Nice complexity n the nose. Raisins and dark bread are at the forefront. There is a slight citrus zest that tingles the nose and a whiff of alcohol spice. There is even a touch of cherry tartness.  In the mouth, several of the flavors reflect the aroma. The dark fruit, raisins in particular, provide the middle, while the tart cherry lingers in its backbone. Sweet malts are balanced by just the slightest hint of clove like spice. The alcohol is well masked. Smooth, velvety and creamy with a finish that is slightly dry. Big bodied, supple but wholly drinkable.   An excellent American made Quad.

Fantastic brew on all levels, never heard of it and decided to give it a go. High abv is completly overshadowed by the depth of flavor.

Per the request of my dear brother, I have renewed my enthusiasm in this Quadrupel ale by one of the greatest brewers around which is, of course, Ommegang. It boasts a powerful 9.7% ABV and a rather rare one at that, as it is not even. It promises depth and beauty, it tells tales of flavors unspoken, and qualities rare to find in the world of beers dominated by tree-swinging monkeys with zero palate and even less brains (hello Coors, Bud Light, Miller, and Milwaukee).    Look-This beer pours an enigma of color. This means to me that it has a plethora of hues available to those who wish to gaze upon the beauty of this brew. In its natural state, it has a cola-dark and brown ale primary hue. However, in different lights, it will shimmer with a variety of flavor colors. You get copper and amber and also dark freckled beauty with hues that make you want to jump into a syrup tree in Vermont. It leaves thick foamy off-white lacing on the glass that is so heavy that it droops under its own weight.     Smell-I get toffee, nutmeg, spices, brown sugar, and of course a smokey oak and cedar. I get a malt-forward aroma that is laced with a smokey pleasantry that shows up again in the flavor. The smell tells no tales of any alcohol content to speak of. This spins silky tales of deception, for the tongue picks up a different story in the alcohol department.     Taste-The flavor is dynamic and dynamite and complex. It has no hops that are discernable, and a malt-forward medium-bodied complexity that does well on the palate. It plays a game with your nose, but the flavors can be captured by the following description. It has a candied cherry, sherry wine, molasses, smoked cedar, brown sugar, candied plum, red wine like a pinot noir, an earthy pepperiness, nutmeg, cinnamon, chocolate, fruit, and for the holidays a strong note of fruit cake. It was not overly sweet nor distractingly syrupy.     Mouthfeel-The feel is creamy and sweet with a tinge of tartness. It has a high carbonation content that results in a perfectly effervescent component that plays well with the variety of flavors. If you have no tongue to taste, then don’t even bother with this one because it will only tease you.     Overall-This brew is absolutely off the hook. If you normally drink the beer of a moron, then don’t even bother for you are not even close to worthy. If you want a beer that is drinkable and crisp, then this one is for you, but give it a chance and a cold glass to pour into. I think that this one will give a different variety of flavor in each sip so treat her well and pay attention. Cheers!

S: Moderate caramel and chocolate. A hint of sour cherries complements the aroma nicely.    T: Medium caramel and brown sugar take a strong presence in the flavor with a moderate note of chocolate. Sour cherry taste comes through more heavily on the tongue, almost so much so as the chocolate.    M: Relatively thin for a quadrupel with very little carbonation. The lightness goes well with the cherry flavor, leaving only a bit of creaminess to be desired.    O: A slight departure from your typical quadrupel, this one is well-crafted with a cherry flare. Very drinkable with almost no medicinal qualities.

Nice dark amber, two finger caramel head.  Nose: Smells just like Port wine. Caramel, cherries and port wine. I could just sniff this till it evaporated it's smells that good.  Taste: Brown sugar and caramel up front. Lots of cherries on the middle of the tongue. Nice malty bread finish.  Overall: This is a fantastic beer. A Lil outside the box for a quad but we'll executed. If this was rated like wine I'd give it a 95. One of my new favorite and now in my top 5. Go get one, you won't be disappointed.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 750ml cork and cage into a stemmed chalice, the beer is a deep, ruby-tinted mahogany coloring with a foamy, bubbly, dense, off-white head. Aromas of date, fig, tart cherry, molasses, caramel, toffee, nutty highlights, and a spice blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and all spice, all on a bready backbone. Flavors are very rich and sweet forward, with toffee and rich caramel blending with a tart and slightly sour cherry character. The old world fruit richness comes in shortly after, providing depth and layering alongside the spice blend and a slowly building booze warmth. As you continue to drink, you start to pick up some earthy tones, as well as subtle funky yeast characteristics. Heavy beer, with a full, slick feel. The aftertaste is more of the old world fruit notes, slightly cloying but very balanced, lingering on through the slick, slow finish. Great beer!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 After doing some research I decided to give this one a try. I poured it from a 750 ml bottle into a goblet. The bottle was dated 2014 so this is a relatively fresh example of this beer, which can be aged like wine.    Look: It pours a dark chestnut but when held to the light it shimmers a plethora of the finest amber hues; ranging from dark ruby to light clover honey. The edges shine like an eclipsed sun. I witness a lively stream of bubbles coming from the base of the glass, as well as some that flutter around erratically. The lacing left distinctive and amorphous rings down the glass. Beautiful.    Smell: Candied banana, brown sugar, caramel, yeast, fig, and plum are present in the exquisite aroma of this high quality brew. As it warms to around 50 °F more overripe banana becomes apparent as well as flourishes of spiced rum. It is an absolutely delicious smell.    Taste: The taste is robust and full: candied banana, dark fruits like plumb, and lots of fruity yeast characteristics. It has a touch of tartness at the end from the cherries accompanying a bourbon-like sweetness. The alcohol reveals itself in flashes of warmth like sunlight peeking through the branches of a tree. Exquisite.    Feel: The texture is satiny smooth and full bodied, luscious and satisfying, luxurious and rich. There is coating that lingers as long as the taste itself does. The carbonation is there to support the richness of it all.    Overall: This is definitely one of the most exquisite beers I have had. It is amazingly complex and the cherries are extraordinarily well integrated in the overall flavor profile.

Smallish bubbles form a thin layer of khaki cream across the brim. Moderate stay power to this one with only a few light swaths of lace left hanging around.     S: Deep dark fruity malts invoke a mélange of darkened breads and plumy fruits with dried currants, cherries, and figs. Not super aromatic I would say but fairly pleasant and inviting. I get some weak chocolate and dark caramel or molasses like sweetness to this. Finishes with a dusty mineral quality and earthy spices. Definite clove there and more dark fruits shown in the close.     T: Bready dark crust soaked in rum and molasses with raisin, fig, and mild cherry or dark berry. The Belgian style yeast conjures up some nice clovey spice flavors with a touch of bubblegum and light smoky phenols. Earthy minerals and more spice with a moderately low amount of bitterness. Alcohol is well masked only asserting a touch in the finish. What’s here is nice but is most certainly restrained. I am not getting a real deep dive to this one at all.     M: Fairly full bodied with a moderate amount of heftiness to it. Could use to have a bit more carbonation. Rests a bit heavy on the palate for the style these are usually more bouncy and soft. Slight drying attempts in the finish. Pretty clean balance overall.    D: A nice year round offering that is easily obtainable but just doesn’t hold up to its Belgian counterparts. And I really wanted to love this one however it falls a bit short of expectations and mostly in the flavor department. Not nearly as complex or in depth as it should take you. That said I found the beer to be well crafted with nice balance and some tasty flavors. Not going to be my favorite Quad, nor will it be my last go with the Philosophers of Three.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 2 | overall: 3.75 Pours hazy copper with a large head.  Aroma can be described as rum and raisin chocolate fudge, with some rose-like perfumous notes too.

Flavors of near-wine grape, with less sweet than the style typically, with bitterness and tartness starting mid-sip and lasting with a dryness. As this warms, the cherry is detectable, but it seems more detrimental to the style than beneficial. I'd like to try exactly this without the kriek.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 On tap at Oliver's in Madison, Wisconsin.    Appears medium brown with a purple hue, half finger white head that dies down quickly. No retention, no lacing. After a while, it looks quite still. Smell is of plums and figs, sweet toffee, yeasty esters bringing forth banana and clove. Minerals. Sugary sweetness, caramel. Flavour is pronounced dark fruit, of figs and plums and dates; sugary sweet toffee, banana, cloves, spices, a slight bit of sulfur. Mild ground peppercorn. Mild dry tobacco. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slick, sticky, lower carbonation, a bit hot, nice intense sweetness and dark fruit flavours on the backend. Overall, a solid Quad that packs a lot of flavour and complexity. If I was more into Belgian ales, this would be a staple beer, although I don't think it compares favourably to Westy 12 and Rochefort 10.

L: Pours a dark mahogany, cloudy/opaque with a moderate creamy white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Mild lacing of the glass.    S: Belgian yeasts and dark fruits on the nose. Cherry and plum... sweet and alcoholic.    T/F: It tastes like it smells... dark fruits and toasted bread. Complex yeast flavors abound, and there's a nice warmth from the alcohol. Moderately carbonated. Thick and smooth... very nice on the palate.    O: A very nice quad from Ommegang and a solid American interpretation of the style. It's not a trappist offering, but it doesn't need to be in order to be a great beer. I'd seek it out again.

The taste is complex with cherry, spice. Quite tangy and slightly sour. Medium bodied and pleasant to drink. Overall, this is a very interesting beer. I'm not very familiar with this style and cannot readily compare Three Philosophers to other Belgian quads but I enjoyed it and would drink it again as a change of pace.

T: medicinal dark cherry up front, filled out by caramel and toasty malt notes.     M: medium bodied, with accurate carbonation levels for the style. Can't complain, but not particularly noteworthy either.    O: not a fan of the medicinal, buckwheat honey-esque theme; but then again, also not a fan of buckwheat honey. Not bad for what it is, just doesn't suit my palate.

Also picking up notes of caramel, fig, and alcohol.    Taste is sweet fruit, cherry but no plum followed by a mix of malt, subtle hops, and boozy warmth.    Mouthful is medium to heavy with low carbonation and a lingering finish.    Overall a wowzer of beer. Very complex but very easy to drink. Definitely an after dinner sipper.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 L: A deep maroon, brown with a beautiful lacey head that doesn't go anywhere. No head retention.     S: Dark, dried fruits. Malt and biscuit    T: Much the same as the smell with a subtle hit of alcohol. Just the right amount of carbonation to pair with the fruity finish.     O: One of the best quads made in the States. A great example of this classic belgian style.

Old    Aroma (11/12)  Wonderfully complex aroma, with dark cherry and sweet malty goodness up front. A lot of dark fruit aromas contribute to the sweet smell – plum, raisin, prune? Date? Very low perceieved bitterness with potentially some floral hops contributing to boquet, but not very apparent. Strong fruity esters are fairly powerful and mask the alcohol well – a slight alcohol presence (med-low) noted. No noticeable ‘breadiness’, no diacetyl. No off scents detected. Heavy inhales catch the high alcohol that is otherwise subdued.     Appearance (3/3)  Beautiful Medium Brown/Chestnut hue with a slight maroon tincture. Large luscious light tan head that persists, great clarity, can see the underside of the head from below. The head sheets very well along the side of the glass as it retreats.     Flavor (18/20)  The beer’s full range of flavors are released as soon as it is moved about in the mouth. The many dried fruit scents noted in the aroma manifest as a backbone for the malt-balanced but alcoholic flavor left on the tongue. Again, the dark plum and cherry flavors, along with the high alcohol content balance the maltiness out. Not much apparent bitterness, potentially a floral addition somewhere in the complexity. The finish is moderately sweet maltiness with apparent alcohol which dissipates to leave the sweeter fruit notes. The very complex flavor is hard to describe but definitely malt balanced with some very slight astringency. No other off-flavors apparent.       Mouthfeel (5/5)  High carbonation is apparent with no stinging bite, very smooth but alcoholic bite comes on fairly strong toward the finish. Body is fairly full, malty, and creamy.       Overall Impression (9/10)  Overall, this is a very complex aromatic quadrupel which masks it’s alcohol well. The beer has a beautiful appearance in both color and head and dances around the mouth. A complicated mixture of aromas and flavors will keep you delighted and guessing all the way through. A wonderful sit-down beer for beer lovers to contemplate the way others will study a glass of scotch. Top notch quadrupel I would drink any day of the week.     Total (46/50)

Leaves a milky ring of lacing around the edges.    Aroma is a complex mix of caramel malts, fig, dark licorice, and booze.     Taste follows the nose. Leads wig fig, cherry and dark licorice. Joined by the caramel malts. Sugary. A slight hint of lightly roasted chocolate. A little bit of fruitiness. The fruit combined with the carbonation gives it a bit of a lambic feel to it. Taste transforms a bit after it warms. Dark fruits and sweetness start to come on a lot stronger.    Silky and creamy, like a good quad. Not much bite from the alcohol. Medium bodied, fairly easy the drink.    Overall, not he best quad I've had, but still very good. Would've liked to have seen a slightly larger malt presence.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured from 12 oz bottle into snifter. Instructions say to pour this slowly, and you need to do that, or else you're going to be left with one giant head. I did it very slowly, but there was still significant head to it. I let it sit for a bit, and once it settled, the head was a beautiful brownish-white layer of fluff. It retained itself throughout the drink, and provided the ale a nice creamy element. Lacing was superb. The ale is smooth, with the cherries providing a very nice touch. This is overall a tremendous beer, and I think absolutely a top-ten quad.

Cloudy like the yeast was jostled because in this particular bottle there was no caky sediment at the bottom.    s: malt, licorice, pumpernickel, medicinal herbs like a Ricola, caramel    t: Fruity and sweet malts. Earthy with slight grain.    mf: thick and smooth...swished around it becomes light and soothing with a slight bite from the alcohol.    o: I love all the offerings from Ommegang and this is one of my favorites. Comforting in its familiarities and exciting in it's differences.

A little too much tannin for me.   Kind of a licorice flavor late in the swallow  Overall: 2.5/5 The bottle says that it is a blend of Belgian Ale with Kriek and Cherry Ale, but I don't get  any cherry at all. It's not terrible, but I wouldn't pick it up again.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours a ruby brown with a billowy head that settles into a constant lace, good carbonation. Aroma has lots of kriek characteristics - dry yeast, tart cherry - along with some muscovado sugar & warm raisinbread. A tad sweet but otherwise enticing. The taste lacks a defining identity - it has some warm phenol flavor but without definition, the cherry is there but less pronounced than on the nose, same with the yeast. It is good, but missing something to elevate it to the next level. Finishes pretty dry for a quad but that is the kriek blend coming into play.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Pours a hazy, dark amber body with a big creamy head. Smells of dark fruits like cherries, dates, and raisins, and at almost 10% alcohol it makes an appearance aswell. Taste is essentially the same as the smell would imply, very sweet, fruity and the alcohol packs a punch but is still enjoyable. Has a very thick mouth feel, it kinda leaves a film coating your mouth, and it has fairly low carbonation. Overall pretty good beer, but is a bit on the pricy side.
