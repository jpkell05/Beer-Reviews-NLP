Finish is slightly effervescent but fairly balanced with just a bit of lingering herbal spice.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 I have drinking this craft beer classic for a very long time, so imagine my surprise when I realized I never reviewed it! Long over due:    Pours out a clear Amber with golden highlights. A soft and subtle white foam forms high, settles down fast but leaves plenty of coverage and a bit of sticky lace.    The nose had aroma's reminiscent of an English pale ale and Belgian Amber. Exactly how the description states, sweet and toasty style malt, buttery, honey scented with some subtle spice from the yeast. The hops are very subtle in the nose but give off some pine and cedar style effects.     A medium body, crispy and then long and slick malty feel gives this a bit of extra hefty, but deep down it's pretty crispy.    A combo of slightly spicy Belgian-inspired yeast with the honey-soaked bready effect of the malt makes for a very unique amber ale. A little, Belgian, a little English in all the ingredients and American in overall style. Malt and spicy yeast with a subtle hop taste of pine and grasses rounds out the flavor spectrum.    Overall, it's a classic. Unique and fun. Not mind blowingly complex but a nice choice if your in a pinch.

It pairs really well with fried chicken, burgers, or steaks. I also used to bring it when I went fishing - I'd be particularly happy if I could find the variety packs as I always enjoyed 1554.    It's still a solid beer, but I've fallen sort of out of love with it.

Something of an amalgam between an English bitter and an American amber, only vaguely suggestive of Belgian ales... And that said, I've had much better bitters and ambers and Belgians than this... Herbal and floral, with some light shellac and a bit of muted, deep citrus; smooth and rather flat-feeling... Not particularly bitter, but did have a mild coating feeling to it; and maybe mild-to-moderately sweet... A decent enough drink, but nothing that makes me want another...

look: 3.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 12 Oz bottle poured into glass (Disclaimer on this one, been sitting in fridge for over a month, so not as fresh as ideal)  Look - bronze, copper colored with a medium foam head, some lacing on glass  Smell - Somewhat weak aroma, Belgian yeast with the malt presence and its fairly sweet. Some spicy fruits.  Taste - very fruity, its actually quite different that a typical Belgian style. Less banana or orange flavor and really no coriander. It's sort of like a pale ale to be real about it. Hops are certainly part of the flavor. Its fairly drinkable. Medium carbonation.     Well, it's hard to tell if this would be drastically better if it was freshly bottled but its a good beer overall. Not what i expected when i saw the words "Belgian style" but didn't know it was an amber ale. So i will give this beer a B+

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 From notes 9/6/14: Pours a clear medium amber producing a huge 3+ finger, off-white somewhat lasting, frothy head that leaves a nice coating of chunky, spider webby lace. Aroma is fronted by toast and biscuit malts with hints of caramel and cocoa, faint honey, fruity and floral hops. Taste is toasted bread/biscuit malts, honey and caramel with a hint of roast. Hops fruity and floral are otherwise mostly in the bitter finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate-high carbonation. This brew pairs well with many foods.

Drinkable, but nothing special. I'd call this beer alright.    The label on my bottle looks exactly like the one pictured here on BA, except that it says "Belgian Style Ale" instead of "Amber Ale." I couldn't find Fat Tire Belgian Style Ale. Is this new? or did they change the name?

Ever so subtle touch of hops that chills at the corners if the mouth for a short time. Web-like lacing coming after a half-finger, white head. Would probably go very well with a good steak and shrimp. Doesn't jump out at me, but a good, solid brewksi.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 12oz bottle served cold into a pint glass. One of the last reminders of a shopping trip a little while ago. Enjoy by May 20, 2018.    Appearance - pours a very clear, amber coloured beer with a modest amount of bubbles and a big creamy cap over a finger in height. Pretty good retention and the lacing left behind is an interwoven spiderweb.    Smell - clean and grainy, with some grassy aromas, a hint of leafy hops and a subtle nuttiness. Mineral notes on the nose too.    Taste - mild, very mild with some grainy bits and the slightest suggestion of Belgian style yeast and candi sugar. Could use a little more punch.    Mouthfeel - easy drinking, middling carbonation and moderate finish.    Overall - a solid example of the style with a slightly Belgian twist. Worth a try.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12oz bottle bb 6/17/18 poured into a tulip pint glass at fridge temp 5.2% ABV. The beer pours bright light amber in color with off white head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is a bit of bread and yeast. The taste is cracker like, slightly toasted malt with a bit of nuttiness and an almost imperceptible tart on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. Overall, very good. Not my particular style of red ale, but it's really well made.

Appearance- Big fluffy white seafoam head with lacing appropriate for the metaphor. Clear gold-amber body with faint bubbling. 3.5  Smell - Nutty and malty with faint hay. 3.5  Taste - Nothing is hidden. Malt, hop and alcohol all on the forefront. Balanced but has a decent kick. 3  Mouthfeel - Malt helps smooth out some but not all of the astringency in the aftertaste. 2.5  Overall - Balanced with a slight kick. 3.5

What I have learned from this beer is that style is rather boring & not very tasty. It's okay and worth a try but definitely not something I care to revisit. I will probably sample a few other amber ales from a few other breweries to see what they have to offer in the style. Cheers! C

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 The clear dark amber beer pours out into a shaker pint glass with a 1/4" layer of white foam that some small patches of lacing as recedes to a small ring around the glass. Sipping creates a few scattered patches of lacing.    The aromas are mostly all about the lightly bready malt with a touch of toffee and only a light floral touch from the hops being noticeable.    The flavors are much as expected from the nose with lots of rich lightly bready malt flavors, some light malty sweetness and just a hint of bitterness.    The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly smooth with the soft and moderate carbonation. The finish is basically a slow sliding away of flavors to an almost dry ending with little or no bitterness    A nice, easily drinkable beer that I'd be fine with having again but which I'll not go out of my way to find again. It would be a good beer to serve as at a summer BBG or outdoor party where the focus is on socializing with friends rather than drinking beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into one of my pint glasses, this beer pours a clear, medium amber/copper color with lots of little streams of bubbles fairly rapidly and continuously rising to the beer's surface. Has a fluffy looking, white head that's about a half inch thick when first poured that settles fairly quickly to a fluffy surface coating of a film layer of foam along with a nice thick ring lining the inside of the glass. Good lacing. Aromas of somewhat toasted, biscuity malts with some caramel sweetness and also a hint of brown sugar. the taste is pretty much the same, with a heavy, somewhat toasted, biscuity, caramel malt sweetness with a hint of brown sugar followed by some earthy, piney hop notes that lend some bitterness. The sweet malt flavors certainly dominate the flavor profile, but the balance from the hops is well implemented here. Has a crisp, yet smooth and somewhat frothy, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish with a sweet aftertaste that lingers on the palate nicely. A very nice beer here all around.     Eric

This gives a 1 finger aromatic head that fades.  The color is a copper medium dark amber.  There is light aroma from malt but not much floral piney hops.  There is a moderate taste from hops which is a balanced mild citrus/pine throughout the palate.  Bitterness is mild throughout the palate with a hint of malt which offers a smooth finish without any bitterness at the finish.  Overall, love the balanced flavors, but lacks richness and aroma.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter via a friend from work--Thanks Kevin  This one time highly sought after amber ale pours a nice clear glowing   amber with a nice head of white foam that settles to a thick ring, thin   pooling layer, and showcases nice light lacing. Nose of toasted caramel  malts and a hint of hops. Flavors follow but present themselves well with   toasted malts and light zesty hops that are balanced and well presented.  Nice mouth feel; medium high carbonation is quenching and lively, medium  light body, and a sweet hop tinged finish.    Overall, a solid ale from a very good brewery. While more macro than micro  it is still pleasant to enjoy. Nothing to hate, more to like.    Cheers

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 12 oz. bottle poured into a willibecher.     A- Amber, nice clarity. Very light tan head, holds a little less than a finger. Decent lacing.     S- Malt. Sweet bread, toast, a little caramel. Not really a noticeable hop aroma. Maybe some earthy notes.    T- Grainy, with some light toasted notes. Subtle sweetness, a bit of caramel. Mildly metallic.     M- Body is medium. Very faint bitter crispness in the end.     O- Average. Despite it being the flagship, I think this isn't their best.

Probably one of the primary beers we were drinking for taste other than the standard Budweiser products in high scho....er, I mean, college. So this and Schlafly were good introductions to the fine art of beer. Taste is a nice malt heavy back bone, some candied sugar, vanilla and almond.

Deep gold, nice foam but it fades in minutes. Lacing is present but minimal.  Aroma is deep dark dry caramel.  Taste is same but with a dry rye hit at the end. Well balanced.  Carbonation seems just right despite appearance of minimal.

Starts off with the light Belgian yeast which gives some dark fruit and light phenols. Caramel and chocolate in there as well    M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation    O: A decent, easy drinking amber that is definitely Belgian-influenced

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Poured into a wine glass    A - Dark gold color with a dense 1 1/2 finger head. Slowly subsides. Some tracings on the glass  S - Bright malt, Crackery  T - Off the bat, the hops - not the bitter kinds, but rather a milder, I guess one could say "floral", kind. Some malt flavour, but largely finished by a peppery bite  F - Not a lot of body, but I also didn't expect much to begin with. Goes down clean and smooth with little residue or effervescence on the tongue    O - Overall, a very good beer. Might go for again, but it's nice to officially say I've tried a Belgian styled beer, even if it's only an American copy   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.25 Pours out a nice clear copper color with a persistent head. Smell and taste are primarily malt with just a hint of hops. Decent carbonation level with a smooth mouthfeel. Overall a nice average beer. Considering the price point a good value and worth the extra buck over any macro.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 3.75 This beer tastes like what it is. It's turned into a "craft macro brew". Similar to one of my favorite craft macro beers which they no longer make. American Ale by anahasuer beusch. Except this tastes like a water down version of it. More malty and a bit of caramel malts. Watery flavor, but high carbonation. Not very sweet. A bit dry.    Nothing really special here. It's not a session beer, and it's not a craft. I don't know where it belongs. Perhaps I out grew this ale.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 The appearance was a clear amber colored body that yields a nice lumpy yet foamy one finger white head and lasts for a good minute and a half. No carbonation is seen rising. Some light spider web lacing is left. The smell has some sweet light hints of caramel coming in and out with each different sniff. The taste is toasty and brings back the caramel really strong while adding a decent yet subtle flavoring of hops. A very nice crisp aftertaste adds to this. The palate is about a light to medium with nothing harsh on the tongue, and is very sessionable. Overall, this is a pretty good beer for its style that I could have again with its respectable food.

look: 3.5 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.5 Look - Pours a crystal clear light copper color, a finger of crackly white head quickly dissolves, no lacing.  Aroma - Faint honey, lager-like, mild grain.  Taste - Very mild, light toast, subtle grainy notes, bubblegum sweetness and a very quick and clean finish.  Feel - Light body, ample carbonation, finishes wet.    Overall - Inoffensive but fairly sterile and one dimensional.

T: Richly malty with caramel and toffee notes and only light and balancing bittering.   M: Medium bodied with moderate persistence of effervescence.   O: Enjoyable. Would certainly have again and try other New Belgium offerings.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 Very traditional, lots of chewy malt flavor - mostly caramel malt - with not much else to round it out, but it sessionable and inoffensive in a respectful way.

They changed the packaging a bit to so I wasn't sure if this was actually a new beer from the brewery or not, turns out it is. I like the bottle shape and bike label a lot. Its a fair amber that goes down smooth but a little too much caramel malt for my taste to drink a few in one afternoon. Cheers!

Good retention and healthy carbonation.  Caramel malty aroma, some spice and faint floral notes follow.  Sweet caramel flavors up front, biscuit following, balanced by the hops. Not much change with warming, but not a sipper anyway.   Smooth, medium mouthfeel.     As a cyclist, the bicycle back story appeals. Looks like this will be one of the beers I'll be drinking at group functions, chain restaurants, sports events for the rest of my life. If this is lowest common denominator among craft curious drinkers, I can live with that. Infinitely better than adjunct lagers.

Smells fantastically very hoppy and very rich in its aroma. Tastes quite malty sweet with a hearty myriad of different floral flavors and overall it's a fun beer to experience.

look: 3 | smell: 2 | taste: 1 | feel: 1.25 | overall: 2 Holy cow... easy drinking beer? In my opinion, no way.  Initial taste is similar to an extremely watered down steak sauce, AKA rusty water with hints of citrus-like old meat Chinese food that you leave in your car overnight.     I find it mind blowing that this is one of New Belgium's signature beers.

A crystal clear, brassy-amber beer topped by a thick, two fingers tall cream colored head.    This is a very natural beer thats good for meals at restaurants or when you just want something with just enough substance while still being very easy to crush in large amounts. Very good beer. I drink it frequently now.   
look: 3 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 3.25 Weird, I used to really like this beer and drank it all the time. Now that I'm into big flavor profiles in craft beer, this was a little underwhelming.  Pour is clear clean amber without much head but with a lot of lacing. Aroma is faint caramel malts and a muted grassy earthy farm scent - I kept thinking about horse farms and cow dung! Not as bad as that makes it sound though. Taste is mostly malty with a burnt coffee overtone coming through, some herbal hops to balance the malt, and a strange sort of rubber taste (the fat tire?) but there was nothing really exciting. There is a bitter aftertaste. The feel was a bit watery with moderate carbonation. Overall I guess somewhat enjoyable and maybe I'm being unfair to it, but for me it fell short.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 1st review here, lots to catch up on...The New Belgium Fat Tire, 12 pack of bottles for the box collection! 40F poured into new Innovation Brewing (Sylva, NC) pint glass.   A little bit lighter than I expect for an amber, but nice and clear for an ale. Head dissipated quickly, leaving a perfect coating, but little lacing.     The bright, but warm aroma has a perfect mix of floral, citrus/lemon and mildly clover or honey? And faint malts come in nicely after...followed by a balanced mild hop perk....    Medium-light mouth feel, with medium carbonation... Yum! Fat tire cruises down the middle of the road nice and smooth, and puts a smile on your face. Taste follows the nose, with a little hop "donkey kick into a malt bag" ending, like popping a small wheelie on a fat tire. It finishes nicely balanced, and inviting you to take another ride. Seems to get maltier and more awesome as it warms, and finishes rich and smooth without ever becoming too sweet, though it temps you to think it will. Well done! I see why it is served everywhere.     Tried this at Brixx in Asheville a few years ago, and now that I've had a bunch of craft beers, it's even better than I thought back then.     Since I love some of their others, I will definitely be dropping by their Asheville brewpub for a tour and tasting soon!

The head has solid retention, leaving a fair amount of lacing before settling into a thin film that rests gently atop the beer. Looks absolutely gorgeous under the light.    The aroma is very doughy and yeasty, with subtle notes of caramel.    The taste has lots of sweet caramel up front, with some biscuits not far behind. The finish is very clean with the faintest hint of hops.    The feel is medium bodied with pretty good carbonation. Incredibly smooth and drinkable.    Overall, am I missing something here? This beer is really good. It's extremely drinkable and well-priced. It isn't the most complex beer by any stretch but it's tasty and well made. Glad to finally have this in NH.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 The average score indicates that the beer snob is strong with this one...    I cannot believe I didn’t review this beer during my seven years in Arizona from 2005 to 2012, which involved a lot of Fat Tire consumption, especially in the early days when this specific beer was all the rage. So now that it’s being distributed in Massachusetts, I had to drink it again. Really happy to see it make it all the way to the East Coast, considering it was distributed in only a few states when I first drank it back in the mid-2000's. Update: had it on-tap during the 2017 Boston Marathon weekend and it was even better than I remember. Sweet, sugary, roasted malt without being too bready or cloying. Easy-drinking. Just delicious.    Isn’t the goal of craft breweries to distribute in nearly every state and be as ubiquitous as the major brands?! People are such haters and have such short memories. I guarantee most of these low scores are from people who, just a few years ago, wondered why Bud and Miller were the only beers at their local store. This is a legendary beer and brewer that put craft on the map! People realize that this is an Amber, right?! Hops aren’t supposed to be the main aspect of this beer. Malt is the key player here! Sweet, tasty malt. Remember malt, one of four key ingredients in beer?!

Nose is mostly malt as is the flavor profile. There's a touch of hoppiness to keep it honest, but it's not very prevalent, overtones of caramel - at least it's not overly sweet. It kind of reminded me of what a cross between Yuengling and SA Boston Lager might taste like. It's a well made beer, but I just find it kind of boring.

Aftertaste is somewhat redeeming with a slight caramel.    F - Light and thin on the mouth feel    O - Going to preface this by saying Ales are my style of choice. This however is seriously underwhelming. I expect much more out of an ale than what this could provide. Entirely undeserving of a 80+ rating here on BA. Lager swillers looking to branch out might enjoy this.

Toast and biscuit on the nose, with a slight vegetal note and faint floral scents. As expected, the first sip brought a big biscuity and bready malty flavor. The bitterness appeared on the back end, accompanied by floral notes that played well with the malt. Easy-drinking and medium-bodied. A great drink if you're in the mood for biscuit, and interesting if you slow down and sip.

Next comes a mild sweetness from the bready malt. Not much of a roasty finish like the beer seems to suggest.  F- could have more body but nice carbonation to present itself.  O- a little hoppy for an amber but malt flavor clearly there. An overall good beer that I know is a good "transition" to craft brews.

look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.75 This is a very common "craft beer" so I thought I'd give it a review. The aroma is malty with little else to speak of. Pours a one finger head that dissipates quickly. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh - possibly too much carbonation. The taste is thin maltiness with a tinge of hops and sweet caramel. I am not a big fan of ambers but I am pretty sure this is not a good example of the style. Overall I gave this a 2.75 which is rather low for a New Belgium - normally I like their beers. It's an okay beer, nothing offensive but nothing impressive - better than drinking Bud.

Diminished head did stick around though with very minimal lacing.     S - Biscuity malt & that signature New Belgium yeast. No real hop smell     T - Very biscuity. Shortish linger with a nice very light malt and mild hop aftertaste. There is a little mild grape skin in there as well as some faint bitter baking cocoa.     F - Medium mouthfeel. Very dry all around. A little drier than I prefer though. Carb is crisp    O - Definitely not New Belgium's best offering. I remember liking this a lot more years ago which surprises me seeing how dry this is. Worth trying for the pronounce biscuit thing but I'm on the fence about recommending.

A crystal clear, brassy-amber beer topped by a thick, twofingers tall cream colored head, that falls to a film, leaving fairly copious spotty lacing.    Aroma has notes of bread, toffee, very light fruit notes (banana, apricot) and slight musty hops.    Flavors are dominated right up front by bready, biscuit-y malts, with some slightly toasted notes and grain working through the mid-palate and towards a finish with dry nutty notes and just a touch of herbal hop bitterness.    Mouth feel is medium, slightly creamy, and at a modest 5.2% ABV this one is very sessionable.    Fat Tire is nearly everywhere these days (at least in my area) and it's easy to see why. It's not particularly outstanding at any one thing- the flavor profile is a bit one-dimensional, if we're being honest- but then again it doesn't miss the mark at anything really. That lack of complexity does make for broad appeal, and also makes for a beer that pairs very well with most any foods. This is a very natural beer for meals at restaurants or when you just want something with just enough substance while still being very easy to crush in large amounts. Solid.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Light copper in color. Inch of white head drops quickly to a film on top of the cloudy brew. Carbonation is visible and there is a very light speckling of lace on the sides of the glass.    Moderate intensity malt is the main aroma to start- biscuit, slight toffee and caramel. A whiff of cooked cabbage (tad of DMS?) and veggies whaffing upward. Unfortunately this nearly out-shadows the quite affable smell of stone fruit that more readily appears as the beer is warming. When its nice and open, the strawberry and biscuit are quite pleasant.     Rich biscuity malt is the first note on the tongue. The beer's backbone becomes more of the grainy-sweet type, especially on the last half of each sip. O.k. finish of more grain. Slight herbal quality to the hops that has to do battle with the less pleasant vegetal-grain hybrid that is increasing in intensity. Still quite nice in spite.     Medium body. Solid finish- not too dry or sweet.     Bonus points for being one of the OG craft beers for me. Finish really could've done with a bit more yum, either from the elevation of the stone fruit or perhaps more of that homey biscuit impression. It's only that inkling of DMS worth knocking in this brew. Solid overall.

One could easily drink a few of these and not realize how much they have drank. The mouth feel lasts only for a moment and is rather welcome with more crisp notes off the nose.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Smells nutty and bready, with a little caramel and copper.    Immediately tastes really satisfying. Nice depth of malt flavors - caramel up front, bready/biscuity middle, and then that signature nuttiness. Finishes dry, despite the medium-full mouthfeel and caramel notes, with lightly floral hops.    Nothing groundbreaking here, just a solid amber ale with a nutty twist and a caramel malt backbone that never gets too sweet.

You aren't happy about the vines but the flowers look pretty nice, the battle will continue in the fall.

It looked OK from above, but it was tough judging clarity, etc. Honestly, it was a little on the sweetish, bready, caramel end of the spectrum for my tastes. Little if any hops presence. Mouthfeel was medium - about what you should expect for an amber. Sweet and bready characteristics carry through the finish. It was OK, but I won't go out of my way to find it.

Smell: Sweet, malty, toffee, biscuit, caramel  Taste: Again, sweet, malty, toffe, biscuit and caramel. It tastes almost exactly like the Erie Brewing Rail Bender Ale. It tastes like an old ale, or Scotch ale to me. It is surprising with the slightly lower abv.  Overall: I can not dislike this beer because to me it tastes like one of my favorite beers which is the Erie Railbender ale, but it has less alcahol in it.

S: Bready, a little bit of caramel, slightly hoppy, nothing really attention-grabbing.    T: Unfortunately, same as the smell in my opinion. Doesn't really have much that separates it from other beers. Not bad, just not great either.     F: Clean, crisp and refreshing. Does not overstay its welcome, just a tiny bit sticky but not bad at all. Texture is this beer's finest point.    Overall: If you want a no-frills, middle of the road beer that tastes nice without overwhelming the senses, drink it. I'm not a big fan, but it's okay every now and then. I would not pass it up if I saw it on tap at a place that didn't cater to my particular tastes.     To good health and good beer.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 2 | feel: 2 | overall: 2.5 Ordered on tap, it was a nice Amber color with almost no head. First sip was so flat that I thought the keg was bad so I returned it and got it in a bottle. Once again a nice Amber color with almost no head. Smell is sweet malts and some caramel. Taste is grossly disappointing with malt, caramel and nut notes. Minimally carbonated, flat and light bodied. Grossly disappointed, will not have again.

If you are looking for a lot of flavor this may not be the right beer, but if you just want to quench your thirst in the heat then it is the right beer.    F: It's light, crisp, and easy drinking in the heat.

Taste is up front bread, rolls to toasted malts and caramel. Flavor does linger for a while after drinking. Feel is light to medium body with no carbonation to it. Overall a solid beer, easily drinkable and meant for all around use. Flavor is probably strong enough to pair with red meats, may overpower poultry save for game meats or bbq. Certainly something I wouldn't have any issue with throwing in the cooler for a bbq.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Just an outstanding beer. It is so refreshing and smooth. It isn't trying to be some over the top powerhouse of a beer. It is malty, low bitterness (IBU), and sessionable with a modest 5.20% ABV. I had this beer sitting in my den and before drinking it I didn't have great expectations because I just figured I wouldn't like this beer style very much. I was pleasantly wrong! I'll be coming back to this beer. I haven't drank Bud Light, Coors, Miller, etc in years. I'd drink this any day over those. This reminds me of a much evolved and better version of light thirst quencher beers.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A clear reddish gold beer with a white head and lots of lacing left behind. There is a nice caramel aroma with some yeast and toasted malts. The flavor is pleasant with a good toasted malt, fruit and caramel taste. This isn't the greatest beer ever brewed but it is tasty and accessible. I like it.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Pours a filtered Amber color. 1 finger of head.    Aroma is of toasted malts, barley, some citrus. A bit vague.    Taste is light and citrusy with a moderate malt backbone. Nothing complex... Very simple but easy to drink. A bit of oatmeal.    Overall, the beers okay but not special. I see this pairing well with Indian curry. It gets a 78/100.

Musky and bright malt aroma. Flavor profile is light, with notes of musky, bread malt, and dark fruit. Mouth feel is carbonated, fizzy, a little watery. It's all tied together with a medium-thin consistency. Overall, it's an alright brew. It is easy to drink and pleasing, but not something to seek out.     Served in a 12oz snifter.

The mouth is light with a trace of a mineral texture.

Interesting sweet smell of sweet honey and malts.  T: Some crackerish and bread malts. I mostly taste notes of honey and caramel. There are some light citrus orange notes as well.

I would recommend this one, especially since it's so easy to get.

This is a fantastic beer cold and out of tap, my local bar always has on tap and its just refreshing. Price is very good and always available, great every day beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 A: [4.25] Nice amber honey colored beer. The beer forms 1 full finger of thick white head. The head clings to the glass and leaves nice arcs of lacing. The bottle lists the ABV (5.2%) and there is a born on date of (04/12/16)    S: [3.25] It seems impossible but I am getting coffee. Then I get corn and some grassiness.    T: [3.25] Very mild flavor. Corn flakes, sweet bread/crackers, honey. Mild grassiness.    M: [3.25] Lower carbonation and below medium body. Nothing lingering on the finish.    O: [3.50] This is an Amber Ale but to me it has all of the telltale signs of a lager. The corn forward flavor seems very lager-esque. The beer is trivially easy to drink. I could put away several of these without much effort. Not the greatest beer ever but it would be a great dock beer.

Biscuity with a crisp hop. Soft and earthy with subtle fruitiness. The malt expands softly to the palate with a freshness to the hop in the middle. Nuts. Sweetly nutty. Earthy dry finish with a resounding hop bitterness. It did drink a bit thinly for the style but I enjoyed the hop presence and the light bubbly finish.

It starts out looking good in the glass but it's a downhill from there and rather steeply I might add. Smells of wet dog fur - very musty and dank. The taste up front is solid and gets your hopes up only to disappoint with a stinging dry bland follow. If this is a benchmark from New Belgium my enthusiasm for another one of their offerings has fizzled just like their Amber Ale did half way through my pint. Just an average beer in a cool bottle and hyped beyond deserving.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 One of those beers I've always wanted to try but could never find.    Look: Pours an orange hue with a one finger, beige head. Laces the glass okay.    Smell: Loads of sweet caramel malt, a touch of slightly bitter grassy hops and a hint of roasted nuts.    Taste: Rich, yet smooth and restrained flavors of caramel and cornbread upfront. A very nice, dry, grassy, European noble hop note on the end to round it all off. The beer goes down easy and as you become accustomed to the taste, hints of toffee, molasses and toasted nuts emerge.    Feel: Light and supple. Low carbonation. Silky and thin. A little too watery.    Overall: I was expecting a more robust flavor from this but it did not disappoint. This is a very enjoyable, easy drinking amber ale.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 A fresh review for a beer I've had countless times. Pours a nice clear amber. Good head retention. Aroma is fairly subdued: a hint of floral hops and bready sweetness. Unobtrusive and balanced taste. Not too much going on, just the right proportion of biscuity malts and hops. A bit light bodied. It's Fat Tire: you know what you're getting. No huge flavors here, but just a tasty and well-made amber ale. Despite saying "Belgian Style Ale" on the can, there's nothing Belgian about this at all.

Fair lacing down the glass.   AROMA: Sweet bready malt, caramel, a little nutty, some dried dark fruit like raisin and prune.  TASTE: Just as aroma.  FEEL: Good level of carbonation, medium thin body, a little slick up front and slightly drier on the finish.  OVERALL: Not bad. Not a ton going on, overall, but, would be good while watching a couple of football games. I'll take this over the usual 'football' brews any day of the week, and a 6'er on Sunday.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 12 Oz brown bottle with a raised ring around the neck. I enjoy almost all labels, but for some reason I just don't like this one. Poured into a Belgian pint glass.    A - light amber in color with a slight hint of haze, but minimal. Tight white head quickly fades to a ring of thin lace leaving a few splotches of stick.     S - bright fruity hops with rose pedals and an excellent suggestion of watermelon? Biscuit malt rounds out a very nice nose.     T - fruity hops and biscuit malt blend very well. Some Belgian sugar and mild cherry.     M - a touch on the light side and usually I want thicker and stickier from this style, but Fat Tire has an unusual quality going on and makes for not only a bright flavorful amber ale, but one that's very refreshing.     O - I had Fat Tire years ago, and while that review was lost in time I once again stumbled across this while out of town for work in the beautiful state of WV. This is a very good ale and one I can add to the list of introduction into the craft beer world. New Belgium have stood the test of time thus far and rightfully so. Their flagship is one of those special ales we sometimes forget about.

Lacking complexity but the style isn't a complex one. Very malty, hops just keep things in check here as one would expect.   
look: 3.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 I don't think I've ever had a bad amber ale. I also don't think I've ever had an amber ale that blows me away. The style always seems to be pretty good, but not amazing, and Fat Tire is no exception.     Had on draft and yeah, it looks sorta amber, sorta light brown. It smells mild and unassuming. It tastes malty and bready and ever so slightly nutty and spicy. It feels pretty light, you could drink a couple of this without any issue. Overall this is a standard, solid beer. It's what I'd order at a bar if there's nothing better, as was the case for me today.

Aroma was pretty much absent, mild malt impressions at best.     Taste gave a woodsy, malty experience. Dark biscuits, super mild hops. This offers some malt flavors that you don't get with lagers and BMC that often, so it has some good gateway properties to it.

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3 Clear copper body, thick malleable light tan head, plenty of coarse carbonation. Nose is toasted malt, raw wet grain. Taste is also malt-dominant, adding tree bark and mild cardboard, with some spicy pulpy hop flavors on the finish. Feel is coarse, medium bodied, yet a bit watery.   BEER. Unrefined grain and unpleasant bitterness is somehow not very offensive to most palates in the USA. I'm scratching my head, but hey, go for it.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 The colour is amber (30 EBC), the liquid is clear. The two finger head is compact and warm white; it sinks slowly leaving some lacing on the glass.    The smell is smooth with nutty sweetness, hints of pine wood and some raspberry jam.    The taste is balanced and smooth with notes of hazelnuts, toasted bread and some passing citric fruits. Medium body. The aftertaste got growing candy sweetness, light fresh bitterness rustic rye bread and some alcohol. Hints of unripe fruits in the aftertaste.    The carbonation is strong and lager-like, the many mid-sized bubbles long-lasting. The liquid is semi-smooth.    Balanced with some nutty flavours, not that far from a Vienna lager.

It hangs on the same level of stuff like Guinness Extra Stout and Hoegaarden as an easily drinkable, and like the aforementioned, works well as the "background music" of beer.

The beer is clear, with a lot of carbonation, and a soapy lacing. The odor for me is malty, bread like, slightly spicy, slightly herbal, a little citrus orange or lemon. The taste for me is bread like, spices, dry, slight lemon, malty. Not much bitterness at all.

Looks great in the glass. Nice deep amber, great head retention. Nutty, great balance and finish. No need for a glass though, this drinks great from the bottle. Leaves you wanting another. This ale has replaced a. Couple of my favorite Euro lagers. A great crowd pleasing ale.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Appearance: Deep Topaz Amber, white cap with good lacing.    Aroma: Caramel malt, toffee, some hop spice.    Taste: Rich malt entry, caramel, toffee, much like the nose. Just a dusting of hops.Finish is clean, crisp, and no bitterness, just rich malt.    Texture: Toothsome, as if you could chew it. It's really not that heavy but conveys that sensation.     Overall: Crowd pleaser of the amber sort. Family and friends admire it much. On paper this beer has some of the stuff I like most and the execution brings those elements together rather well. Wouldn't change a thing.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 DATE: April 10, 2016... OCCASION: recovering from a sleepless cub scout night at Liberty Science Center with The Force Awakens... GLASSWARE: Barley Creek pint.. APPEARANCE: brilliant rush of active effervescence busies a bright copy body... head is thick, cambered like fresh snowfall, and off-white, creamy... AROMA: thick, toasted bread malts that hold this sense hostage... a soft, flowery bouquet celebrates aromatic hops, while slight spiciness--pepper and vanilla--gives dimension to the experience... PALATE: medium-bodied, welcoming and sessionable... bears a crunch at the teeth and a lingering patience in its leaving... a dry creaminess pervades... TASTE: .a lot happening in this one: biscuit, toasted malts, chestnuts, and some toffee make a back-end treat, while the light hops provide an aromatic, garden fragrance that softens its impact... then, pepper, vanilla, orange zest and ginger root... OVERALL: a worthwhile standalone, or a session ale at 5.2% that is decidedly American... the balance is tough to argue with, even though the malts are front and center...

This is probably the first "real beer" my lady finally tipped back and really liked. This is one of the first beers that also opened me up to the "micro brew" style o beers and took me away from the macros. Always will have a soft spot in my heart and is absolute great beer to drink. Enjoy...

Smells of sweet grains. Taste deliciously simple with a mildly sweet yet hoppy balance. I could drink this all day. Slight effervescence that makes the finish pleasant and clean. Definite do over.

I've been on a kick of anything amber, red, rye, etc., and with a recommendation from the guy at the store, I just had to try it. Had it ice cold with some Korean BBQ and thought it was alright. A perfectly average beer. Just had it at about room temp (a little lower), at which I enjoy most beer, and was not happy at all. Biscuit-like malt: sure. Hoppy freshness? No. The aftertaste was something nutty but not in a very pleasing way. Body was pretty light and way too much carbonation. All in all it tasted watered down. Perhaps I was simply expecting something I would love and didn't get exactly what I wanted, but I'm staying away from this beer going forward.
