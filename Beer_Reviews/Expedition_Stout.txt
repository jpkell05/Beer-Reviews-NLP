look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 No other beer has the balance of being a thick and hearty body, and just a bit of sweetness. The sweet flavor isn't forced, and it isn't too much. It is obviously naturally a residual essence from great ingredients and brewing - not like other beers that throw blobs of coffee, chocolate, or whatever, and rely upon them for the primary taste.  I should point out that this is not a beer for the meek. If you have ever had a bud, miller, coors, ... and thought "this is refreshing", this beer is too much for you to even watch someone pour from across the bar - and definitely too much flavor for you to handle.  I discovered the beer decades ago, and haven't found a better beer since.  #1 beer in the world.

Smells like licorice, big bold dark fruit, black grapes, dark berries, blueberry, black cherry, toasted graham cracker, dark chocolate, caramel swirl, a little smoky, hint of vanilla, touch of herbal hop notes and a lingering dark coffee roast. Tastes rich and savory with dense dark baker’s chocolate, dark coffee roast, smoky, dark caramel, dark molasses, slight vanilla, toasted graham cracker, dark fruit, black grapes, blueberry, dark berries, black cherry, licorice, with a big herbal earthy hit from the hops. Feels medium bodied, creamy with smooth moderate carbonation. Overall a really nice Russian imperial stout.

Aroma consists mainly of dark chocolate and fudge. Notes of cream, leather, licorice, char, dark fruits, wood, and espresso. Very pleasant.    Roasted notes and coffee beans upfront. Notes again much like the aroma, in the order of leather, licorice, char, and wood, while the sweeter malts are least prominent. Hops dominate and provide a pleasant spiciness. Feels really smooth and balanced.     Excellent stout.

I wasn't really expecting much but that's usually the time when the unexpected happens. The unexpected was simply what I got with this - from a beautifully dark beer with late forming, tan head (another unexpected surprise) to the roasted malt smell with chocolate notes - all of this was a very good first impression. Mouthfeel was a bit watery but still medium-bodied with a taste that matched. Yes sir, this is something unexpected, and good.

Prominent chocolate and licorice taste. After a year of aging, it still has a strong alcohol taste.   I think another year or two of aging the stout would mellow it and make it even better.  I would recommend buying a few bottles. I will buy again.

As the head slowly shrinks to a cap, layers of lace appear. Opaque polished ebony, just a hint of brown.  Roasted malt and alcohol control the bitter smell with a fresh opened can of coffee and bakers chocolate in the background. The taste is bitter, dry and malty throughout as alcohol, chocolate and coffee blend in the rich middle without a lot of carbonation. The finish is dry and bitter. The malt, chocolate, coffee and boozy heat plus moderate spicy hops linger a while. Almost full bodied, smooth towards the end. Big, bitter and rich.

Charred chocolate with hints of espresso and black licorice in the nose. Full bodied with an oily, viscous mouthfeel. Rich bakers chocolate, over-roasted coffee beans, and a robust intensity on the palate. Finishes with lingering chocolate and hints of booze, licorice, and char.    About as good as a non-BA stout gets. Quite pricey though at 3.60 per single.

Maybe its just me, but there is a slight tart/berry aroma as well. This beer smells like a delicious RIS.   T: Full of roasted malt flavor with notes of chocolate, dates, figs, molasses, coffee and toffee. Bitter finish with lingering malty/chocolate sweetness.   F: Thick and chewy consistency with a heavy body. Carbonation is spot-on for the style. Creamy smooth finish with just a slight fizz.   O: This is a delicious brew. I am glad that it is starting to see some distro out in CA. I think I am appreciating it more among all the love of pastry stouts. It is nice to get back to the basics. It's delicious and is not boozy. It is full of character and flavor and lives up to its name. I am very glad to have tried and would buy again. Cheers!

Aroma is big and malty, hitting roasty, toasty, nutty malts along the way. There is a little herbal and spicy hop action that livens up the aroma a bit, although it's still heavily focused and centered on dark malts. A light addition of chocolate and dark fruits rounds out the aroma. Flavor profile is caramel, toffee, dark chocolate, and dark fruits with roasted, toasted, nutty, and bready malts behind. Hops are more of a whisper here, but hit notes of herbal, spicy, and floral. Mouth feel is dense and thick with a velvety texture. Overall, a big stout with big malts and still perceptible hops. It's not overly complex or loaded with additional flavors, just a great straight-forward stout.    Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.

There's also a earthy,wood,and dried fruit aroma hidden deep in the aroma  Taste is boozy, bitter black coffee upfront and it takes a while for that to subside to let the other flavors come through .

Not viscous or oily feeling. Overall I will try to stash a few bottles of this gnarly elixir. Intense experience but worthwhile.REVISION: After 90 days in the bottle there is a noticeable improvement in feel and taste.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Bottled on date is '08/31/2016'.  Black colored body, with a very thin mahogany edge when back lit. Half finger of tan head blooms at the end of the pour. Leaves behind an oily sheen of lacing that coalesces into scattered small spots.  Aroma of deeply roasted malts, dark chocolate, peat, smoke, and tobacco.  Taste is silky and spicy, with dark roasted malts, a range of chocolate from milk to dark, with a bit of smoke and a hint of dark fruit. Has a bit of peaty char deep into the after taste.  Mouth feel is thick, mouth coating, and creamy. Some felt alcohol but certainly not a burn. Appropriate carbonation.  Wonderful beer drinking experience, with rewards all through the taste profile (which is long and deep). This is a sipper beer because of all the nuances that can be discovered and savored, not because it is a challenging beer to drink.

Near black appearance. Smell of dried dark fruit, unami, some coffee bitterness, vanilla, and chocolate milk. Taste is of coffee bitterness and finish with some of those dark fruits and a nice milk chocolate flavor.     At three years, I can see this lasting at least another three in the bottle. Still a little bitter for my liking. Will revisit next year. I do not think unami flavors will over take the complexities of this beer anytime soon.

Sampled October 20, 2018    It has a deep dark brown to almost black appearance with a small, silky, fading mocha head.    Despite it's higher ABV percentage the aroma em its little in the way of alcohol. It does bring out sensations of bold, dark roasted malts with some milk or vanilla and a mild burnt character. Low hop profile.    Full bodied mouthfeel. Smooth.    Along with the roasted sweetness in the flavor I pick up a hint of the 10.5% booze. There is a charcoal like character too and a semi-dry finish. A wonderful Imperial Stout.

Nice thick oily black color with minimal head and no lacing, but still looked great. Smells deeply of dark chocolate, roast coffee, dark sweet fruit and vanilla. Tastes of dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, plum, raisin, molasses, vanilla, caramel, malt and something else...graham cracker? Delicious. Nice smooth, sticky, creamy mouthfeel. Good amount of carbonation. The high ABV doesn’t hit you upfront and this beer is dangerously, deceptively easy to drink. Truly a fantastic beer, and I will have to circle back, buy a six-pack and keep it in the beer cellar to see what happens after aging for a year or two.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 this is the freshest bell's beer in the area and probably one of the few i wouldn't give a damn if it was fresh or not. heavy pour into a tulip showed a thick puddle of black mud with a slim tease of a head. immediately a ton of roasted and charred malts hit, ton of chocolate and vanilla. flavor is dense, lot of different things happening from chocolate/coffee roastiness to some sweet vanilla and bits of fruit, all wrapped up in a blanket of an earthy hop bitterness. fills the mouth and leaves a bit of a boozy warmth but not enough to stop it from going down way faster than a 10.5% stout should. gonna pick up a couple more to hide away for a few years. that unlimited shelf life is going to be put to the test

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Date: Bottled on 09/10/18, sampled on 10/18/18.    Apperance: Pours inky black with no real head to speak of.     Aroma: Brownie batter like fudgy chocolate, sweet roasted malts, and tons of vanilla. I mean wow, there is a lot of vanilla here. It smells sweet, a bit like Prairie Paradise, just to that level of sweetness. I also gets some milky caramel notes.    Taste: The taste is big sweet vanilla up front with some chocolate hitting as well, but then the beer just does a swan dive into dark malt roast and bitter coffee char that really lingers. The mouthfeel is correspondingly thick and a little chewy. I like the duality of this one, one side keeping the other in check... or not. Dr. Jekyll's brew? As the beer warms even more, a marshmallow flavor rises up. Also, I have previously had this beer with about a year and a half on it and it was fantastic, with all of the above plus additional notes of dark rum soaked dates and raisins. So kids, by a six pack and be sure to tuck at least three away for 2020.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Had this tonight as part of a four year vertical tasting. Each pour was into a wine glass with a rich dark body and not much of a dark tan head which may have been caused by the bottles being opened earlier. Smell was richly chocolate and roasty malt with a slight bitterness that faded with each successive year. Taste followed the smell and was very enjoyable; with each successive year the bitterness faded and was replaced by dark fruit flavors while the chocolate was unabated. Mouthfeel was just fine.    I bought a six of this to age previously and, after drinking the current year, was wondering why bother not drinking it now. The vertical tasting answered that and then some.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I'm a bit late to enter this into my New Beer Sunday, so I guess I'll just give it a good ol' straight-up review... I've been a big fan of Bell's darker beers that I've been able to get my hands on since we've started to see distribution over in New England. This is a beloved RIS, and one that I've never before been able to weigh in on. Super glad to get my hands on a single bottle! I had Black Note last week and thought it was great, but I definitely felt like I didn't quite know where it was coming from. This beer is the missing piece that I need to experience to put it all together!    Pours an intensely-dark color with a thin but very retentive mocha-colored head. Solid lace forms as I sip, giving this a really solid appearance. It reminds me of the very first few batches of Clown Shoes' Blaecorn Unidragon, a similarly huge RIS that went straight for the style.    The nose is incredibly roasty, with a big chocolate and caramel aspect that inevitably falls behind the roast. Caramel maltiness and Belgian chocolate round everything out. There's very little dark fruit compared to other Russian Imperial stout beers... this is all about the cocoa and earthiness! Hops seem relegated to backing up said earthy elements, but also seem to give off some herbal and floral character. Mostly sweet caramel and chocolate, though... a very decadent smelling RIS.    The flavor profile is sweeter than expected, with strong elements of Belgian chocolate, earthy hops and caramel/toffee. My tongue is utterly inundated by the intense roasty cocoa flavors here... it's almost too much; beyond the realm of what I want in this style of beer. Just absolutely decadent with pine-like bitterness following through and a bit of a floral element kicking around toward the finish. I'm unsure of whether or not this beer is really what I want in the RIS style, however. It tastes quite excellent, but it does have a bit too much roast for my taste.    The feel is moderately heavy with a bit more carbonation than I expected. Once again, this betrays what I assumed it would be... it is a large beer with an appropriately done body, and I get that, but it's just a little on the nose for me. I've known about this beer for a long time, and having now had it... I'm somewhat nonplussed. It's excellent for a strong stout, but maybe I would feel that it's even better with some time on it? Black Note is great with a year on it, so this is probably in the same realm.

Chestnut highlights give it a little glow, and a thin espresso foam barely shows itself off despite a heavy hand.    Heavy roast is first and foremost. A combination of over toasted bread, dark roast coffee, and for the first time in my life, I'm finally getting what I have heard over and over again with some aged stouts...soy sauce. Brown sugar and a little savory spice top it off.    Very rarely do the aroma and flavors seem to match perfectly for me, but Expedition Stout does just that. With a little addition of dark chocolate and a splash of clean booze, this is really enjoyable. This 'soy' experience is working for me, especially thanks to my love for and in this case perceived salinity.    It feels right. Rich and smooth, sticky, sappy, with a nice roasty bitter finish. The alcohol warmth is perfect. Not too intense, but makes itself known.    Most of Bells offering I think are great. This one is in their top tier for me. With so much attention going to bourbon barrel aged and adjunct stouts, it's always a pleasure to enjoy a true imperial stout in it's intended raw form. Cheers, and thanks again Craig.

The beer pours dense black with mocha brown head that recedes to a thin ring and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is dark chocolate and roasted malt. As it warms, the fruit and raisin aroma comes through. The taste is dark bitter roasted and chocolate malt. There is a bit of dark fruit and booze in there as well. Mouthfeel is full bodied, adequately carbonated and surprisingly dry and clean in the finish. Overall, excellent. This beer can be what you want it to be. Very bitter and raw fresh or mellow as it ages. Recommended.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I’m feelin’ buzzed and it’s all because... Yep! Raul got himself some Bell’s Expedition and he is ok with that.     Dark like the lump of coal I got in my stocking in the 4th grade (it was a bad year, my peeps) yet aromatic enough with bitter chocolate and coffee... Raul is like, “ok, let’s dig a bit deeper.”     So the Raul man digs, and he sips, and he’s like: yeah, it’s aite. But it ain’t no FIS. Flavor is there, but like my baby mama, it’s also a bit ornery, hot, and insipid.    Throw Bells Expedition Stout out of bed for eating crackers? No no no. But if I had my first choice in who I’d like to invite, FIS would get my vote instead.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Bottled 8/31/17. Reviewed 1/18/18. Rich, malty, aroma; dark fruit and chocolate. Deep black color with a 1/2 inch tan-to-brown head, receding fairly slowly, leaving thick lacing down the side of the glass. Thick, creamy feel. Chocolate and dark fruit (but less fruit in the taste than in the aroma), mild start with a nicely bitter middle and finish. You can tell this is a strong beer, but the alcohol is well-controlled in the taste. Just a very slight burn in the finish.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a single-serve into a stout glass    Pours opaque and motor-oil thick with a fantastic, two-finger, tan, foamy head and outstanding sticky lacing.    The aromas are super and complex. Multiple types of chocolate (cocoa, semi-sweet, and cake batter at various levels); dark fruits; toasted marshmallow; char; and just a hint of booze.     The flavors may be even more complex and nuanced than the nose. Chocolate on multiple levels, sweet, semi-sweet, and bitter, with hints of coffee (but not too much); dark fruits (fig, raisin) and dark cherries steal the show. The char is less pronounced on the palate than it is on the nose. The booze is definitely there, but it's a pleasing warming note, not a burning one.     The mouthfeel is simultaneously thick, chewy, and viscous, and eminently drinkable thanks to some extra carbonation and just the right amount of dryness. It never gets cloying or too sweet.     This RIS is right there at the top of the list. I've had RIS's that are better at certain attributes than this one, but the total package here it tough to beat. It is one of the best beers I've had lately, if not ever.

Nice and plummy dried fruit aroma.    taste is quite strongly molasses. medium roasted malt on the back end, dark fruit and faint chocolate notes. ever so slightly smoky and bitter. excellent taste.    mouth gets pretty close to full. finish is slightly sweet with roasted malts around the edge of the tongue and faintly bitter in the back of the mouth. 10.5abv isn't all that noticeable.

Pour is a jet black color with several fingers of thick, rich mocha head. Lots of spidery lacing left behind. Aroma is dark and roasty, with a boozy tinge. Flavors are big on roast and figs and plums, with a bitter bite and boozy undertones befitting the style. Thicker feel. Quite a nice companion to the Breakfast Stout I had earlier.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter. This is a fresh bottle. September of 18. This beer pours out thick like motor oil. It's black and forms a beautiful mocha/caramel colored crown about a pinky width. The smell is roasty and sweet. The sweetness brings in nice notes of chocolate and molasses. It also has a detectable hop bitterness. The taste comes in the same way. Full of roastiness with a slightly creamy body. Hop bitterness there and the sweetness remains. Just always an amazing treat and such a classic.

Smells of dark roast coffee with dark fruitscarmalized brown sugar, cocoa, and earthy hops. Alcohol notes are ther in aroma, but not hot or solvent. Tastes dark & chewy with notes of burnt chocolate, coffee, cocoa, and dark fruits. Feels full bodied with a lingering bitterness and a lastin dark chocolate aftertaste.     A strong, intense RIS that is full of complex flavors but could use a little aging to let the flavors meld a little and mellow out a bit.

Still an awesome beer when consumed during it’s earlier stages!     Jet black beer in a glass, tan head.     Smell of dark chocolate, black coffee, smokey with a bit of vanilla and dark fruits (mainly fig and raisin). Taste follows in suit, although I get a kind of beef jerky flavor that is not present in the aroma. This brew is complex!     Overall a very smooth brew, one that I enjoy very much and will come back to. Can’t wait to have one this thanksgiving with a slice of pecan pie.

Nose is quite roasty and a little smoky, with good malt character, solid baker’s chocolate, a little sweet cream, a little (but not much) bitter coffee. Good, but for the style, nothing too special. Taste is a little more interesting to me, with a little leathery licorice and some fleshy dark fruit complementing the predominant slightly chewy chocolate, and a zippy hoppy edge that affects the feel more than it does the taste. A little smoke lingers. Fairly light feel and not very boozy, considering the abv. Can’t believe I haven’t rated this before. Solid offering, and more than well-well worth a shot.

Tastes of bitter hops, heavily roasted malt, burnt coffee, chocolate, cocoa powder, a lot of alcohol, and some very light sweetness. Medium-heavy body with medium carbonation. Overall it's a very good RIS, I just wish the alcohol were a little less apparent.

It tastes like dark chocolate, rasins, prunes, and smoke. The smoke taste stands out to me. This beer feels heavy due to the abv. Overall this is a world class beer.

They say it ages well and I would expect so. It could go for a little smoothing out and just seems like a beer screaming for a year on it. I don't know if I can make any bottles last that long though, as it's already very good fresh. Good job bell's, keep the good beer coming.

By far, the beer with the most flavor and depth is the one that was aged for threee months in the bottle. The other 2 felt thinner. I’m glad I tried the bottled version from this year; this beer was a little disappointing other at the 2 other stages of aging.     Drink at 3 months!

The head is brown and creamy, very thick and mocha-like. Retention is very good, and a fluffy ring remains 20 minutes later. The edges of the head leaves sheets of wiry, creamy lacing.  The nose offers deep savory umami, dark chocolate with caramel, cocoa butter, some more bitter cocoa powder, gingerbread, molasses, licorice, espresso beans, raisin, allspice, prune, date, and fig.  The palate immediately opens up with that soy sauce, beef broth, umami impression. A salty meatiness that causes mouthwatering. Tons of spices, dark fruits, and a huge bready presence follow. The molasses, licorice, and star anise give way to gingerbread, fruitcake, and rye bread with lots of raisin, dried fig, prune, and date. The massive bready malts of the mid-palate give way to a rich dark chocolate and bitter cocoa flavor with intense dark roast coffee. Finishes slightly sweet at first with rich dark chocolates, but the bitterness lingers, tasting continually of bitter chocolate and coffee beans.  The mouthfeel is super smooth and creamy throughout, almost like a milkshake saved for the medium-minus to medium carbonation that pushes the beer along the palate fast enough to make it insanely and dangerously drinkable. The balance is both bitter and sweet, but enough of either to enhance the drinkability and noteworthiness of flavors.  Overall...yes, this is a world-class stout. It's damn good and worth every penny.

If you're a hophead then this may be a beer for you, but I prefer more sweetness in a RIS. I figured 2 years in the cellar might have reduced the bitterness, but I really don't think it has. Let's give it one more year and see what happens. I'd rather spend my money on Old Rasputin if you're after a true RIS, personally. It's plenty good, but overpriced.

The flavor is intensely bitter dark roasted malts with a big dark fruit and chocolate coming in midpalate. It finishes dry with bitter burnt malt that seems a little stale.  The mouthfeel thick and coating, probably the bright spot of the beer.  Overal, this is an overrated beer. It's one of the few classics I just don't get.

My favorite beer    Pours black. Thick, short, light brown head lasts a little while. Lasting ring.    Smells dark fruit, roast malt, dark chocolate, earthy hops, mollases, light coffee. So complex    Tastes very roasty and dark fruit, figs, molasses. Followed by earthy hops, dark chocolate and touch of coffee. Finish is dry with a roasty Linger. Full body and creamy, smooth medium carbonation.

Exciting pour. Very nice color, really up on this beer. Then the taste. Plug tobacco. Thats the overwhelming taste here. I enjoyed chewing plug tobacco working at an orchard in my youth, and you spit. This was waaaay too reminiscent for me, of a good plug of tobacco. Gave a second bottle a pour a couple weeks after my first - still the same. Glad I tried it, if you've chewed plug tobacco, this may not be the beer for you.

One finger of thick mocha head that disappears half way through. Very little lacing. Some legs.    Nose is assaulted by deep dark chocolate followed closely by big expresso coffee. Dark fruits. Plum and apricot. Alcohol. Very rich. Some molasses.    Deep dark chocolate on the palate followed by expresso coffee. Huge dark roasted malts provide the necessary bitterness to offset the sweet chocolate. Dark fruits. Black walnuts. A little boozy but the creamy texture and flavor overwhelms the alcohol easily. Very earthy.     This brew is smooth as silk. Excellent carbonation.    This is a massive stout. Very complex. Impossible to describe all the aromas and flavors. Without a doubt one of the best available.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This was poured into a mini snifter. The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a less than a finger’s worth of foamy tan head that dissipated within less than about 30 seconds. The smell had a big roasty to semi-smooth bitter coffee bean leading into a delicate cocoa and light vanilla to round it all out. The taste was pretty smoothed due to the date, I’m guessing, still a nice roasty smooth coffee and cocoa delicately weaves together to lead to a decent sly roasty aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a good sessionability about it. Carbonation definitely smoothed a bit with a nice drying edge leading into a rounded out stickiness over my tongue. Overall, an absolutely awesome RIS well worthy of coming back to.

However, with a beer drinking session cut short (I"m out of beer, good beer that is).. A half intoxicated beer drinkers mind wanders to a thought of a dark over grown cellar. The jungle of OHio has overtaken a cellar I haven't been in for a year or so. So, sitting thinking about a time I bought this beer and stuck it in a cool dark place,Thinking did i leave a bottle or two in there.. Apparently, my nostrils have sucked in something. Or lack their of, no micro in the frig.,,Hmm... any options  Getting up from my wooden couch and hacking thru some vines, yee one finds expedition stout. Wow , date reads Oct. 2014.

A manly-man stout (and for the appreciative woman, too). Rich and luscious with a bitter, dry roasted edge. A meal-in-a-bottle, if you will. Satisfies the senses on many levels...

Aroma of leather upfront, pipe tabacco, licorice, char. A little hazelnut. Subtle chocolate taste and roasty malts upfront. The rich leather and licorice in the back end. A slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is soft, creamy, and low carb. Glad to try a 3 year aged expidition stout. Always heard how well this ages, which could've contributed to the lack of sweetness. Very good.

The head settles into a thin collar, leaving some random splotches of lace as it goes.    The aroma brings tons of coffee, char, and vanilla cream up front. Then comes a wave of dark chocolate and roasted nuts. The back end is slightly boozy, with plenty of fruity notes and just a whisper of hops. Nice complexity here.     The taste is all coffee up front, with huge waves of dark chocolate not far behind. The middle brings notes of vanilla and black cherries, as well as some fig and raisins. Finishes charred and slightly leathery. Big and bold flavors here.     The feel is full-bodied with slightly higher carbonation for the style. Thick, chewy, and creamy as all hell. Has some slight alcohol warmth, as to be expected.     Overall, this is one beast of a stout. It's bold and complex, with tons of flavors and aromas to keep your face in the glass. It's a bit higher in carbonation than I would like, but otherwise this is a world class brew. Well done.

As a fresh beer there is a lot of hop presence but that obviously smooths out over time. Aroma still vestiges even on a nearly three year old bottle, but there is also robust milk chocolate, slightly curdled cream (but in a good way!) and dark malt. Tons of bitter chocolate & smokey coffee dark malt on the tongue, along with vanilla creme and almond. Still some hop flavor floating around but adds a nice bitter kick and doesn't clash. Super silky mouthfeel. Sounds cliched for this beer given its reputation but definitely does better with a couple of years on it, which is pretty impressive for shelf stout.

Mouthfeel is full-on heavy & silky, and Expedition Stout finishes medium wet/dry and bold.   RJT   
look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Bottled 9/8/16. Guinness pint glass. Can't believe I have never reviewed this.    A: pours a completely opaque black with two fingers thick, frothy tan head. A little carbonation sticks to the sides of the glass.     S: fruity and hoppy right off the bat. Where some RIS's are malt and roast forward, I get a heavy dose of hops, followed by a dark, roasty, and flinty malt backbone. That head retains a one-finger cap seemingly forever. Nice lacing.    T: arrival is, not surprisingly, sweet. Complex blend of dark fruits, hops, and a good bit of alcohol. This is pretty much how I remember it. There is tremendous complexity here; layers of roast, fruity esters, and hops; but something is off-putting in the alcoholic finish. Bell's signature house yeast maybe isn't so hot (or is too hot?) at this ABV.    M: thick, chewy, low carbonation, slick.     O: for what is probably my favorite brewery, and one of my favorite styles, this beer has always been a miss for me. I think it is one that really needs to be aged. The really high and noticeable alcohol detracts from the experience for me. It is beautiful to behold and smell, and fine in texture, but something in the taste is just not my cup of beer.

A: The body is pitch black. The head, being very minimal and only existing in the sides of the glass, is browny to caramel-y. No carbonation is visible.  S: The aroma has a big blueberry profile, mixed together with coffee, roasted malts, a too prominent profile of alcohol and I guess lactose. With the exception of the alcohol that is very noticeable, this aroma is great.  T: The taste is incredible, as it has a fantastic and very intense aroma of coffee, a slight one of toffee and dark berries. This is my kind of beer.  M: The body is high. Carbonation is a bit higher than perfection, which should be a little less. Alcohol almost goes unnoticed.  O: This is MY kind of Russian Imperial Stouts. Please world, make more of this.

Taste is also very rich, with lots of chocolate fudge...very creamy and thick...and dried fruits with a barleywine-like sweetness. Damn that is a good beer. I wish other breweries would get their base beer to this level before they started worrying about BA programs. This is goooood.

F: Smooth and complex with lots of coffee and roasted malt flavors. Mouthfeel is thick and warming but not heavy.     Wow, what an imperial stout.

A very complex stout full of Chocolate, dark fruits, dark cherry, some vanilla, and a vinous character presents it self as it warms. Roastiness & notes resembling coffee are on the lighter side. Not too bitter, not too soft. Silky actually, and it tastes so damn good, I realized that I needed to pace myself. I was near finished with this 10.5% 12oz bottle in 15 -20 minutes or so.     This beer at a few months from bottling already has all the characteristics I look for in the more common West Coast Imperial Stouts I have easy access to after they've aged 2+ years. THIS was very impressive to me.     While not quite a perfect example of the style for me, it sure was as close as it gets.

Aroma is very hop forward along with some roasted malts and hint of dark cherry. Taste follows the nose. Roast qualities are far more pronounced along with a strong hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium plus, a little thinner than I'd expect from 10.5%. I can see why people say this beer needs to be cellared. The hops really dominate, suppressing many of the roasted coffee and chocolate notes that this beer could offer. Time to sit and mellow should allow the hops to take a back seat and the roast to shine. 90.25 points.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 Look: Oil slick black with a quarter inch thick volcanic ash colored head. Short retention on the head. Has the look and viscosity of motor oil. Awesome!  Smell: The usual stout culprits with caramel, dark-chocolate, and espresso. A bit more nutty and oaky than typical stouts. It reminds me of Ben and Jerry's salted butter pecan ice-cream. This might be a remnant of the licorice from the Kalamazoo Stout.  Taste: It begins a little sour with a sweet and salty finish like a mixture of soy sauce, bourbon, hot chocolate, and raspberry soda. The malt character is moderately starchy. The aftertaste is not as dry as I would have hoped for a high ABV beer but it has a salty and sweet finish that is fantastic.  Mouthfeel: The initial taste is rich and noticeably carbonated while the body is only slightly thicker than a porter. The finish leaves a long moistness in the front of the mouth with a more dry texture in the back. Similar to a root-beer float.  Overall: This beer makes keeps me guessing with every successive sip, which means it is either really good, really bad, or really weird. I think it lands somewhere between weird and good.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Bottled 11/6/2015  Poured 1/20/2017  A - Pours a pitch black color with a 3 finger, coffee colored head. Phenomenal head retention and lacing. Full embodiment of a stout.    S - The most overwhelming aroma that hits right off the bat is chocolate and sweet malts. Dark sugar and molasses are notable as well. An amazing and incredibly sweet scented beer.    T - Although not as present in the aromas, the bitterness of the dark fruits comes out in the flavors. Chocolate, malts and sugar are present as well with a sweet, mild chocolate aftertaste. Fairly bitter but very pleasant and will definitely improve with age.    M - Full bodied beer, well carbonated (especially given the age) and smooth. Creamy texture with an ever so slight booziness to it. Very enjoyable.    O - The stout brother of the Hopslam ale. As an avid stout lover, this brew definitely ranks amongst the best I've ever had. The aroma and aesthics are as near perfect as you can wish for. The flavors are robust and delicious and I am excited to see how they shape themselves with age. Very drinkable and enjoyable and simply one of the best stouts you'll ever find.    Poured 5/20/2018  Characteristics as a whole seem in-line with how I remembered it over 1 year ago. Perhaps changes will become more pronounced with a few more years.    Nevertheless, some changes to note-  A - Same as before, less head  S - Somewhat more muted. Chocolate is still must noticeable aroma. Molasses seems more pronounced.  T - The biggest change I note is the dark fruit flavors have become more prominent. The bitterness appears to have faded and the lingering sweetness enhanced. Booziness and coffee flavorings slightly more pronounced.  M - Less carbonation, more creamy and smooth texture. Continues to improve with age.  O - Was meaning to have a few months ago and never got around to. First time cellaring and having the willpower to wait to consume one of my favorite beers, and although I plan on cellaring the others for a few more years, I am pleasantly surprised how distinguished and refined the beer still is, albeit better!

You can see some alcohol legs sliding down the glass and good looking carbonation when I rock the glass. Nice aroma of molasses, leather, chocolate, minor coffee, dried dark fruit, earthy, and just a slight alcohol note. The flavor matches the smell, just bigger. The blend of the molasses, chocolate, and dark dried fruits is working, and the alcohol is there, but less so than the aroma. Fairly thick on the feel, smooth, with just enough carbonation. Slick and sticky, and rich. A slight bit of soy sauce going on, but not off putting. Real nice Imperial stout.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 The 2016 iteration of Expedition Stout is a slightly effervescent, impenetrably black beer with orange footlights and a medium, slightly rocky brown head; lacing is good, consisting of tattered bands, and head retention is modest. The aroma is medium in intensity: milk chocolate, cocoa and more subtle molasses notes, topped by distractingly strong antiseptic alcohol overtones. The flavor is a moderately bitter, somewhat understated, seamless blend of baker's chocolate and cocoa with more subtle molasses and toffee notes, all over an assertive undercurrent of booze. The finish is a good hit of chocolate, molasses and booze; the linger is a modest, thin chocolate bitterness backed by a solvent-like alcohol bitterness, and lasts for a good while. Mouthfeel is a bit light for the full body, and is warming; the texture is sticky/creamy, thick, and slightly peppery from the well-expressed carbonation. (12 oz bottle, 42 days after pkg)

As it nears the finish, highlights of dark cherry and walnut pop through, with just a hint of piney hops creeping through, linger of chocolate and espresso    M- thick and viscous body with moderate carbonation produces a creamy and velvety mouthfeel that seems to fold in layers of cream, before finishing silky smooth with just the slightest trace of alcohol warmth on the linger    O- a classic that is one of the best easily available straight up RIS out there. I believe that this one will get better with age.

Smells of blackstrap molasses and earth. Molasses upfront, with chocolate and dark malt. Light smoke. Semi-heavy on the mouth, with a bit of tingle from the carbonation. Not chewy. Great beer. Probably would benefit from ageing.

This is clearly a world-class beer.

Pours medium viscosity and black, with only a tiny head on a careful pour, so no lacing noted. Nose is coffee and roasted malt. Taste follows, with bitter close. Carbonation seemed higher than average, so an OK mouthfeel. Overall OKish, but pales in comparison to Ten Fidy.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Note: I've reviewed this beer before but I didn't like my review so I'm gonna write a new one. Also this was bottled 9/2/15 so just over a year old.    Look: Pitch black creamy brown head tons of glass lacing when you swirl the beer.    Smell: Right away I get dark fruits rasin and plum especially. Then you get some of that sweet milk chocolate and dark chocolate. Also the more I smell it I get charcoal and really big roasted malts. The beer smells great though.    Taste: right upfront you get that milk chocolate and big dark fruit notes rasin and plum middle of the mouth big roasted malts dark chocolate burnt wood charcoal in the finish you get a big hop biterness it's like chewing on pine needles. That biterness lingers in the aftertaste to.    Feel: full body it's verging on chewy but it's not quit there. Very smooth silk like on the tongue.    Overall: This is a super complex beer. Just a lot going on and it's amazing that it's not even barrel aged and it's this complex. The barrel aged version of this beer is pretty awesome though. But so is this. The huge hop presence makes this a beer you can age for years. I only see this beer getting better with time. But still now at just over a year old it's quit a treat.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Once again I am thankful that this is being distributed to SoCal presently, as this certainly wasn't always the case. Bottled on 9/2/2015 - poured from a 12oz bottle into a 10oz nonic. Served lightly chilled.    Brownish/bistre body - totally opaque with a fine layer of buff foam up top; sandy lacing, no legs, good retention.    Malty, vaguely boozy aromatics suffused with roast notes and hints of molasses.     The flavor profile is impressively complex with abundant layers of stewed fruit, charred/roasted/toasted grains, and heady esters. Bittersweet, earthy finish draws you back in for repeated cautious sips. Low bitterness and only vague hop flavors throughout.     Thick, full bodied, nearly oily mouth-feel but with sufficient carbonation and attenuation. Warming from the alcohol.    While not as unique or memorable as the top tier of RIS - this is a generous, classically crafted, flawlessly executed example of the style.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 2015 bottle near cellar temp. Pours a thick chocolate brown with an espresso head. That is a rich aroma! Roasted malts and tons of chocolate, a bit of sweetness. Taste is mostly a mix of dark chocolate and dark fruit. Good balance of richness and bitterness. Char, caramel, coffee also present. A warm and bitter aftertaste. Nice and thick. A classic standout imperial stout.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 From a 2015 keg, pours a deep black with tan head. Smell is rich dark fruits, cocoa and coffee. Taste is all that, immensely complex and delicious. Sweetness/bitterness balance is just right. Feel is medium-plus. Overall a wonderful RIS.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours a mostly pitch black but with a hint of mahogany. Nice fingernail length mocha head, disapates to a creamy swirl. Ring like lace is slightly sticky.  Aroma not too overpowering; hints of roasted malt, dark fruit and dessert liquer.  The taste takes on many different variations of flavor. At first, roasted malt taste with an esspresso like, hoppy and raw cacao bitterness in the finish. The aftertaste lingers but pleasantly so. Dry enough to make you want more. As it warms, the dark fruit; prunes, raisins etc come out and it becomes sweet. The ever present alcohol also becomes bolder but not overpowering. Big body, viscuous, smooth and creamy. Robust yet easy to drink.  I thought this one was great! I have another one that I'm considering aging in order to compare the difference. Let's see if I have the discipline, because it is that delicious!  P.S. I was unable to age the other one as I was too tempted. I broke down after a week.

It's everything one wants in an Imperial Stout. The combination of roasty-toastiness with the earthiness reminds me of some Baltic Porters I've had. Overall, it's fantastic and one to sip. I'm in a good place.

Smells like dark roster malts with some oak in there. Tastes like burnt caramel and chocolate. A tiny hint of sweet like marshmallows as the beer warms. Medium to heavy mouthfeel with low carbonation. If you told me this was barrel aged I would believe you, or at least oaked. But this is the non barrel-aged version. I can't even imagine what barrel aging would do to this. If you have an extra...

It has a sweet milk chocolate type sweetness and the bitter hops faded out to barely noticeable. I can only imagine what this will taste like when it is bourbon barrel aged. I adjusted my previous scores after trying it last night.... Just opened a bottle from 9-15.  The look is black and oily looking as I poured it.It had a small dark brown head.  The smell is roasted malts, chocolate and sweet cherries.  The taste is sweet up front from the dark fruits and a bitter malt finish with the alcohol clinging to your mouth.  The feel is nice and thick.   This Stout ages nicely. I have two more which I will let them cellar for at least a year from the date.  For a 10% Stout, this is tasting sweeter as I let it warm. I served it at 53 degrees.  I will definitely will buy another six pack.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2016-05-31  12oz bottle served in a snifter. Packaged 02/02/15. I've had this once before, long ago (I think before I started rating beers), and it was too intense for me then (based on recollection). We'll see how I experience it now.    Pours black with almost no head, very little fine carbonation. Looks like an RIS. Smell is chocolate and roastiness, a hint of sour cherries. Something yeasty.    Taste is intense -- surprisingly fruity, though. Some nice bright cherry and plum notes, very nice. Huge roast bitter finish. Majorly sweet up front, majorly bitter as it finishes. Nice demonstration of extremes. Coffee, a little chocolate. This is an interesting and very enjoyable beer.    Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, mouth-coating, with just a bit of graininess. Superb beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This is a ballsy stout, like Port Brewing's Old Viscosity. It's not a sweet one, it's very much on the bitter chocolate, winey dark fruits, roastiness. It stays with you for a very long time. I would have wanted tobacco, or smokiness to really push the boundaries. As is, it's a bit too much on the dark fruits for me.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Various bottles ranging from fairly fresh ( < 2 months) to about 10 months. Have yet to try a truly aged Expedition, but it's on my list! Never have enough patience to keep aging them fully.    Look - Very dark, almost black, very thick. Hardly any head retention, but maintains a small ring around the edges.    Smell - Chocolate, almost fudge or cake, small hint of chili, roasty notes (more so on the very fresh version).    T - Really excellent balance between chocolate and roast with pleasant bitterness that makes you want to keep drinking more. Very slight dark fruit notes.     F - Thick! Very smooth and creamy drinker.    Essentially the perfect example of an Imperial Stout.

(T) It has a really nice balance of flavors, coffee, chocolate, banana, dark fruits, and it has a nice lingering bitterness and alcohol is almost not detectable.

Jet black pour with a thin toffee brown head and heavy lacing. Smells of dark malt. The taste is one of licorice, coffee, and molasses. Very creamy mouth feel. Overall, I enjoyed this, but just not my favorite stout. I'm sure this is sacrilege, but just one novices opinion.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 Aged 6 months from bottling date in the dark.     The pour : Total inky blackness, straight 5,000 mile oil change black with brown tinges from the bottle...you know the kind. Head forms a finger in the snifter and fades to a firm creamy moss on top. 100% opaque. Totally on point for a RIS.    The smell : From the bottle I get smoky lactose and ripe bananas; from the snifter with some agitation I get (a 5 star appearance with an almond head!) more ripe bananas, black cherry, dark figgy notes, raisin, a touch of milk chocolate, and a small hint of metal. Complex, deep aromas with focus on fruits but not quite linear. Solid.     The taste : Less powerful than it was fresh, but still fabulous. I get a mishmash of oats, chocolate, lactose, raisin, banana nubs, with a significant stale metallic note permeating the whole profile. I know this metallic presence was not there before, perhaps it's infected or these 6 months have been rough on poor Expy.     The feel : is beyond amazing. By far the creamiest, substantial, deep stout I've had. Excellent.     The skinny : So basically I think this bottle was an unfair trial as my first one from the pack was totally amazing. The metallic bitterness presented here almost ruins the experience but I know for a fact this was better the first time through. Perhaps the best thing to do is to age the rest of them another 6 months to shave off whatever might be mutating in there.

Thin espresso colored head that quickly fades.    Aroma has so much going on. I get chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, wood, leather, cherry, and booze. Wow.    Taste matches up. Boozy, chocolate covered dark fruit with some leather and wood. The intensity builds as it moves through the mouth, finishing with a huge, stinging bitterness.    Motor level oil thickness on this one with light carbonation. Not quite the fullest I've ever experience, but in the top three without a doubt.    Expedition Stout belongs on the Russian Imperial Stout version of Mount Rushmore. The only issue I have at this stage is the massive bitterness on the finish. This is one of the few beers I think would benefit from some mellowing, so to the cellar the rest of the six pack will go!

Smooth as silk with a nice head that recedes nicely while maintaining very gentle carbonation and creamy texture. Seriously, this stuff is crazy smooth with little alcohol burn.    The nose has a lightly charred, smokey flavor with some coffee and chocolate notes, and just a hint of black cherry and port wine. Flavor is also bitter on the front end with some coffee, cocoa, and molasses, and just a hint of that savory, briney, soy sauce flavor that many imperials stouts come with. Mild black cherry flavor makes a return here too.    As good and accessible an example of the style as one could ask for!

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured into snifter glass. It pours a rich, dark mahogany, nearly black, with a one-finger, mocha-colored head and extensive lacing that didn't dissipate throughout the pour. It features that classic RIS smell: chocolate, coffee, caramel, dark fruit, and and enough booze to get your attention. The taste is truly outstanding with lots of roasted malt, dark chocolate, burnt coffee, caramel, and one of the best dark fruit profiles I've ever experienced. The tastes blend magnificently. This stout is rich and very creamy, lightly carbonated, and easy to drink despite its 10.5% ABV. Overall, Expedition merits its lofty rating. It is exceptionally well-crafted and delicious. This is just a notch below Parabola and right up there with Ten Fidy, Narwhal, and some of the other big name RIS's. I'm hooked!

This is right up there with all my favorite stouts - speedway (can't believe I never reviewed this one, but easy 5), ten fidy, a Stone IRS...Chocolate, coffee, motor oil-esq nectar of the gods. This one lives up to the hype for me.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 6 month old bottle from date on label, maybe too young, couldn't wait. This is Bell's after all.     Look- Black as night, it is like motor oil, tan thin head, quick run lacing. (Doesn't last)    Smell- almost too much to describe, so much going on at once- pine, tar, resin, chocolate, coffee, wine.    Taste- dark Chocolate, coffee bitterness that lingers, possibly some very ripe banana, noticed that after many tastes.    Feel- Smooth, light carbonation but the effect here is so appealing for the style, the ale just lingers on the tongue and the palate, you'll feel it sip after sip it's right. Bitterness will sit on the back of the tongue for a while in such a pleasant way commanding another taste.    Stout's are not my favorite style-but- now this Stout is one of my favorite's how's that for a change of pace!?  Only Bell's could do something like that-     It's a massive Stout and I recommend anyone give one a try regardless of palate preference- it's simply an amazing ale.     If you come across this- it's a must have.  Cellaring would be damn fun if you have the patience.

Aroma was deep bitter roast, chocolate malt.    Thick consistency and viscosity, coats the mouth, enveloping mouthfeel. Covers the alcohol well, imparts heavy notes of chocolate without using it as an adjunct. Very chewy, but yet not heavy relative to every other aspect of the beer.     Remember when the Bros gave this beer a C-? Those were the days.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Acquired this vintage bottle from my gracious neighbor. Will give him homebrew and other beer to compensate! Also need to figure out how he stored the bottle.  Bottle has date of October 2012.   Poured into a goblet-style glass at 40F.     Look: Opaque black with no head.    Smell: Sweet stone fruit, soy sauce, concord grape-like vinousness, coffee grinds, overripe bananas    Taste: Dark plum sauce, bakers chocolate, leather, spicy white pepper. Has a 'soily licorice' roasty aftertaste that is extremely pleasant and reminiscent of Kalamazoo stout. Moderate nondescript bitterness at the back end (the ghosts of hops past) keeps the syrupy sweetness in check. Combination of earthy, vegetal hops and soy-sauce style umaminess in aftertaste not bad, but not great either.    Feel: Thick, luscious, and creamy start with a surprisingly dry finish. The moderately low level of fine carbonation is pleasant.    Overall: A great stout. I'd be interested to try a fresh bottle and compare, seeing as this is my first time trying this beer.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottle, dated 11/6/15. Pours black with a medium sized khaki head. Smells of mostly dark roasted malt and earthy hops with some dark fruit and cocoa. The taste follows exactly with lots of malt and hops, some more reserved cocoa and dark fruit; very good intensity. Moderate bitterness and slight dryness in the finish. Above average body and carbonation. Overall, it's a pretty straight-forward RIS. It's advertised as being cellarable which makes sense with its strong malt and hop profile.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bell's Expedition Stout - Bell's Brewery, is one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts I have ever tasted. My beer was pour after sitting in the basement for almost a 16 months after purchase. Yummy.  Super dark pour. A nice foam ring hangs around for quite some time. Thick , malty and delicious. I find the 10.5 ABV is well hidden as compared to others.  This is a quality beer and yes, you pay for the quality as you do with all great beer. Another fine product from one of the best breweries out there.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Awesome brew. Super easy to drink for 10%. Nice chocolate/roasted malt notes with some dark fruit that comes through as well. i drank some bottles that had aged quite nicely. What is great about the RIS is that over time, the flavors come together more harmoniously over time. Unlimited shelf life for these bad boys.

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a wide Belgian-style (Duvel to be specific) glass.   I gather people drink this beer at various levels of aging - this one was about 5 months old.     A: Very dark and little to no head. This beer has a strange viscosity to it, which some people think is a positive, but to me, it's a bit strange! It really does look like motor-oil, as one of the previous posters suggested - if you look at it up close it even has that same sheen.   S: This is where this beer really shines. The aromas are incredible, with all sorts of excellent roasted malts in combination with all the dark fruit / raisiny smells you might expect. But what's so impressive is you don't just get that ethanol smell overriding all that subtlety, even though the ABV is quite high. To get those aromas to come through at that level of alcohol is extremely impressive to me.   T: Very good. This beer is drinkable and delicious, but can also be appreciated with small sips. The level of bitterness vs. malt is nearly perfect, at least at the aging that I had this bottle. They got the balance right. The only reason my rating isn't higher is just because the excellent aromas don't quite come through fully in the taste.  M: Similar to what I said regarding smell, it's impressive that you don't get hit with any overwhelming alcohol burn or anything like that, despite the high ABV. You can really enjoy the beer. And, although I thought the viscosity was weird for the appearance, it's totally pleasant as far as the mouthfeel.   O: I don't think there's really any way to dispute that this is one of the top high-alchohol stouts out there. It's an exquisitely crafted beer and really my only knock is just that I personally think the oily/not-too-carbonated appearance is not great, but if that doesn't bother you then really there's no faults with this beer at all.

Aroma initially was of mild birch beer then dark chocolate and coffee. The first sip blew me away with the thickness of this brew. This is heavy stuff! Thick and chewy with a bit of oiliness. Low carbonation. The taste is complex and hits you in waves of malt, dark chocolate, coffee, caramelized sugar and followed by black licorice. And . . . that is only in the first half of the glass. As you savor the complexity, you may notice dark cherry and raisin flavors too. Watch out for the alcohol. At 10.5 ABV, you do not notice it at first. It sneaks up on you. Sip this one slowly while listening to some of your favorite classic jazz, country or oldies. You will want to roll this on your tongue and savor every drop!

Not as much chocolate as some, can taste the alcohol, some ash, smoke   M: not as smooth or as silky as some other RIS but not bad.  O: It is a very good RIS but I like Plead the Fifth or Yeti better , alcohol hidden better and more silky mouthfeel. This was bottled within the last 4 mounths and is a young stout.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a 12oz longneck into a tulip. This beer is absolutely inky black - no light whatsoever penetrates the glass - and is topped by a huge thick khaki head that falls slowly. Lacing is thick and sticky.    Aroma is dominated by sweet malts, dark chocolate notes, and alcohol, though not to a nose-burning degree.    Flavors hit the palate with a huge wallop of semi-sweet chocolate along with hints of blackberry and caramelized sugar. These are soon followed by espresso and toasted grains, licorice, and smoky notes. The finish is strong coffee bitterness and pleasantly warming booze, and lingers for an eternity.    Mouth feel is thick, syrupy and chewy, coating the mouth as you drink. This is a beer that pours huge and drinks huge... luxurious. Given that body and the brawny ABV of 10.5% this is certainly one you take your time with.    I had heard little about this this stout, and after drinking I have no idea why more people aren't totally geeking out about this one... this is a deep, huge, complex monster of a RIS, completely world class, and should be talked about in the same revered tones as Old Rasputin, Ten FIDY and other paragons of the style. Yes, it's a trifle expensive (I gave a shade over $16 for a six pack) but for a stout enthusiast it's money well spent. And even as good as it is now, this one should cellar excellently. A true tour-de-force.

I'm cellaring some, but wanted to try a fresh one because I had never tried Expedition (Bell's just came to TN this year) and couldn't resist. Look is black and thick and a beautiful dark brown on the edges, with a creamy, thick hot chocolate head that slides down the glass almost glacially.    Smell is dark chocolate, grainy cereal, hot chocolate espresso, molasses, fig, plum, licorice, and dark wood -- big, and bold and earthy.    Taste is deep, dark, bitter, toasty, roasty chocolate and molasses, with a touch of peat and licorice. So rich. There are some wonderful dark fruits in the background, as well, that add an additional complimentary decadence to the beer. This isn't an overly-sweet dessert beer, by any means. Just beautifully deep and dark and drinkable, but highly sophisticated. This beer on a cool night by a campfire? Near perfection.    Mouthfeel is thick and chewy and extremely creamy. The residue of the bitter chocolate with a little bitter hops is wonderful.    Not sure there are many better non-barrel aged stouts being produced. Look, smell, taste, texture. Just a fantastic stout. Highly under-appreciated given everyone's tendency to focus on barrel-aged stouts. Cellar some (update several years later: I'm sipping on a 2-year-old bottle that is every bit as good as your typical barrel-aged stout, with incredible depth and still a wide range of flavor characteristics) but don't pass up on the fresh offerings -- you'll never be disappointed with this beer.

A very interesting stout bcuz it involves so many complex flavors in one. I agree that providing this brew some age would make for a whole other great analysis/taste. For some stouts, the alc% is well hidden, this one, not so much. However, make no mistake my friends; I rated this beer as high as I did for a reason. Enjoy

Chocolate and fruits, absolutely delicious flavor to go with the nose. This is probably the best stout I've had, and my only concern is how I'm going to get all these bottles back to Texas with me. I'll figure that out, and I can't wait to see what they do with some age.

Great lacing of dense little bubbles, and the head seems to stick around forever. The smell is super roasty. I can taste chocolate and coffee notes, but mostly it's roasty malt and some bitter hops. It's dense and chewy. A well-made stout.

Interesting looking raspberry/brown head. Small amount of lacing.  S: Salty Jerky, Chocolate, Raspberry, smoke, hint of coffee.  T: Follows the nose a lot. Strong chocolate and coffee flavors. Very sweet upfront with smoky roasted malts. However, very fruity taste. Raspberry and blueberry flavors come through with the sweetness.  M: Very heavy. Strong, smoky aftertaste.  O: Very sweet and strong beer. The fruit flavors (not sure how they got there) threw me off a bit. Flavors reminded me a lot of their Old Coast Ale.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This beer pours a dark black with a small head. The first thing that strikes me about the aroma is it's booziness - not in a bad way. This is followed by dark chocolate, very mild unbrewed coffee, licorice, cassia cinnamon, cherry blossom, rose petal, and a host of other unnamable scents. Dark chocolate and licorice lead the way, with the floral notes playing a wonderful background flavors. The sweetness is very present in the aroma, but the flavor is quite dry. The mouthfeel is sticky and full. Overall this is an awesome beer to sink into.

Taste is super rich roasted nuts, deep deep molasses, cocoa infused ginger snaps, and a very distinct hint of black licorice.

The taste is full and smooth with a rich dark malt flavor with hints of cacao and coffee. The mouthfeel is perhaps a little thin for this stout. A good stout that should age gracefully.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Pours like pitch with a copious tan head that resolves very slowly – smells strongly of roasted and charred malts, cocoa, coffee, citrusy hops, earth and hint of leather. Tastes sweet malts forward with hints of molasses, caramel, some coffee, transition to a dark chocolate, hint of dark fruits and a smoky, earthy note and a rather clean finish. Well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, milky and chewy with pleasant finish with only the mildest (not unpleasant) tacky texture.  Very smooth stout, thoroughly enjoyable – easily one of the best RIS I’ve had – and the price point is reasonable for a beer of such high quality.

Great looking RIS with a deep obsidian color accompanied by a thick dense, dirty brown one finger head.    Smell of dark roasted malts with a hint of char and sweetness.    The taste is excellent, with a great combination of bitter notes from the hops and dark malts, and deep rich complexity one would expect from an RIS, topped off by healthy amount of sweetness to balance out the taste.    The feel is thick and viscous, coating the mouth, and accented by the frothy head of foam from the original pour, which holds on for about 1/3 of the beer's consumption, and further enhances the feel.    Overall: This is an awesome beer on tap, with an amazing balance of characteristics for an RIS. If you're a fan of the style, then I would strongly recommend it.

look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottled 10/16/15, so it's still a young RIS: pours pitch black with a menacing looking darkness which produced a huge 2+ finger brown head that was full of bubbles of all sizes that crackle and hiss as it faded very slowly, leaving outstanding foamy lacing coating the sides forming foamy rings as it went down. The head was like a brown cloud that didn't budge for a pretty long time. Very impressive looking stout.    Smells of dark chocolate, coffee beans, burnt malts, charred wood, cocoa powder, toffee, brown sugar, light piney hops and earthy notes. The dark chocolate is the star of the show, almost dominating the air and really standing out. I like the char and smoky aspects, but don't get much fruit or hops and was a little let down by it's simplicity. It smells good, but not great.     Tastes much better than it smells, wow it's complex and gets better with every passing minute. Initial flavor is molasses, bitter coffee grinds, toffee, dark chocolate and maple syrup, then it turns fruity and sweet with dark fruit such as raisins, dates, red wine and black cherries. Mix in some brown sugar, cocoa powder, port wine, espresso and charred wood or a s'mores that fell into the campfire ashes, and you've got this very complex flavor profile to enjoy. Everything works well together, dare I say in harmony, and it is so smooth for a big beer that it's almost dangerous to drink. Really tasty, naturally getting better as it warms up.     Mouthfeel is slick but thick, chewy and almost viscous like syrup; the sweetness is tamed by the roasted and burnt malt bitterness which gives nice charred notes mixed with coffee grinds and a bunch of chocolate. It's like a dessert in it's richness, fading with a nice mix of chocolate sweetness, faint booze and complex roasted malts that seem to turn fruity and let out more dynamic flavors.    Overall a really damn good beer that hides the 10.5% ABV masterfully and is a RIS I could drink all the time. This is the type of beer I'd love to have in stock at home year round. I imagine this would age with the best of them so I will seek out more of this, as I suspect it will get better with age and drive up my rating. This brew lives up to the hype.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 12 oz. bottle, bottled on date 09/11/2015. Finally getting around to reviewing this one from Bell's, acquired a single bottle from the local beer store.    Poured into a Big Eddy snifter glass.    A - Pours an impressive opaque dark black body, around one finger of dark chocolatey mocha head, bubbly, that leaves behind good scattered strands of lacing. Looks excellent.    S - Big roasty charred malt aroma. Huge complexities of vanilla, oak, wood, chocolate, roast, & cream, with perhaps even a slight touch of fresh piney / fruity hop presence.    T - Taste follows the nose: big dark roast, chocolate malts, notes of vanilla / cream / wood / earth. Big notes of roasted barley malt & notes of char / coffee. Very robust and delicious. Chocolatey roast / malt bitterness.    M - Robust & roasty malt bitterness on the palate. Very smooth & creamy, extremely drinkable stuff for the high abv.    Overall, an extremely drinkable and delicious RIS from Bell's. Definitely a beer I will be adding to my rotating line up of beers more often, and a surefire contender for some serious aging. Highly recommended stuff.    Bell's Expedition Stout -----4.5/5   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Did a 10-year vertical with friends. Below are our general thoughts on how it changed each year.    2015 - tastes young, woody, bitter, chocolate  2014 - cherry, milder, sweeter, lost its bitterness  2013 - got more complex, a "flavor punch" as Matthew said.  2012 - smoother, milder, back to a 2014 taste  2011 - deep cherry flavor, dark fruit, fig, chocolate, chalky, back to the "flavor punch"  2010 - "I can't tell if this one is my favorite or if I'm just buzzed," says Megan. Lost its fruitiness, more date, salt, 7UP, minerals, not as mild  2009 - a small swig tastes like nickels or loose change (oxidation), but a big swig is like chocolate goodness "going through my body."  2008 - super woody, smoky, "the flavor is back!" says Griffin. Matt ranks this one in the lower 50%. "Pretty metallic with no strong flavors to cover it up."  2007 - "Ooh, very chocolatey," says Megan. Smooth. All the metallic taste is gone. Really good. Michael is debating if it's the best of the bunch.  2006 - Smooth, oily, almost like a bourbon barrel aged beer. Salt, no bite, strong flavor of everything that's come before. It's like "a concentrated version of the current 2015 stout," if they put it in a saucer and boiled it, it would be a chocolate or mole sauce. Very little alcohol bite.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Poured from a bottle dated this year.  L: An aggressive pour led to very little head and head retention. Beer appears jet black both during the pour and in the glass. Looks like a big stout in the glass.  S: Sweet syrup, dark fruit, chocolate, and a little alcohol on the nose.  T:Follows the nose with lots of sweet syrup, carmel, and dark fruit flavors. The finish brings on roasted malt, coffee, chocolate all balanced with some nice bitterness. Slight alcohol warm and heat.   F: Interestingly, lots of carbonation in the mouth leads to a creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Easy drinking for its ABV.  Overall this is a somewhat sweet imperial stout which brings more syrup and dark fruit flavors than other RIS. Am interested in how this will taste with a year or two on it.

Not overly complex I find chocolate and dark fruit easily and at 10.5%abv it's smooth and highly drinkable. I'd like to age a few and see what comes of it. A great take on a RIS that I can't wait to find on tap. I will pick up regularly..

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Poured into an Abita Pint glass. My bottle was brewed in September 2015.    Pours with a very thin head, very little lacing to speak of. Nice deep black color. A very nice looking beer in the glass.    It has a rich, sweet smokey smell with a hint of pepper.    The primary flavors are very well balanced between the malt and the chocolate, with the chocolate winning out by a hair. This beer presents both sweet and bitter tastes with the slightly dominant sweet being offset by a light peppery finish. The alcohol in this beer is almost completely hidden.     Very smooth, rich mouth feel. This beer is, to me, the perfect pairing of taste and texture. Every sip pleases on multiple levels.    The overall drinking experience associated with this beer is excellent. A beer you can sit and savor, take your time with and enjoy slowly and steadily. Definitely among the best in its class. I will definitely be putting some of these up for a year or two to bottle age. If you find yourself with the opportunity to try this beer, I strongly suggest you do.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 **  11/21/2015  Go Lehigh. Lafayette Sucks. 2014 Bottle (13 months old) to goblet. Aroma is a lot of roasted barley. Hints of coffee also. Appearance: Dark black color, very thick, with thick light tan head. Taste: bitter dark chocolate, roasted barley, maybe a touch burnt. Excellent beer though. Feel is thick and meaty. Not quite as tasty as some other stouts, but all the peripherals are on the mark. Excited to age a few of these further.  **  03/25/2016  Picked up a younger bottle. Bottled 9/11/15, so about 6 months. Very nice. A tad less bitter than i remember the 13 month old bottle.  **  10/19/16  Bottle to pint glass. Bottling Date=10/23/14.    At just under 2 years, this is still sublime.    A truly expeditious stout.  **   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 I decided to do a taste test between a newly released bottle and a bottle cellared for a year. I found the 2014 to be slightly less carbonated as the head was a bit less than the 2015. I also found it to be a little creamier than the 2015 variety. Head to Head I can't really say I have a favorite, we'll see what another year brings to the 2014. There was not a tremendous difference in taste but the alcohol may be a little more subtle in the 2014. Keep in mind, I usually start at 10% ABV and work my way up, if it is under 10% I won't usually bother.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 From a 355 ml bottle (packaged September 2, 2015) to a snifter.    A-The beer looks heavy as it pours into the glass. A nice, dense head of khaki foam starts at about one fat finger tall and lasts a good while. The beer is black and opaque beneath the foam. Good looking stuff.    S-The aroma is pretty intense with higher levels of roasted grain, bittersweet baker's chocolate, coffee bean, a little alcohol warmth, and some vanilla bean that gives just a little creaminess. There are some hops here, but the beer is nicely balanced.    T-Wow, nice layering of flavors here. The beer opens with a little hit of roasted barley bitterness, then a waive of milk chocolate, raisins, black licorice, and sweetness kicks in. The next layer transitions back towards bitterness with baker's chocolate, heavily roasted grains, medicinal alcohol, licorice and coffee grounds. The finish is long on the palate.    M-The feel is medium in heft with a soft, almost imperceptible carbonation that gives the beer a nice creamy texture.     O-This is a really well-done beer. It looks pretty much like I think a stout should look, and it smells and tastes great. Very complex. A big beer for sure, but a really nice one to sip on this chilly November evening.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Black in color, fluffy khaki head, streaks of lacing, and brewed on 9/2/15. Two and a half months young and the bitterness is there but nothing that detracts at all. Aroma of dark cocoa and dark fruits but not much else. Huge flavors of chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, and a marshmallow sweetness. Quite thick and coats well. Smooth, yet vicious, and the abv is well masked. A truly spectacular RIS! Probably one of the best I've indulged upon.

Updated for 2013 on tap at MacKenzie's. Pine notes haven't mellowed and very roasted still.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Pours a motor oil black color. Has a slightly boozy aroma with moths of chocolate. Flavor is smooth, a little oaky and there is a presence of chocolate and malts. Overall a very solid stout. This could be drank any day of the week.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A: Dark black in glass. Mocha ring as it settles, and not much else resembling a head. Pretty nice legs on the glass though.     S: Straight forward with Chocolate. Vanilla. A muted nutty flavor in there as well. The alcohol in this big beer is well hidden.     T: Nice roasted coffee bean that wasn't there for me on the nose. Some chocolate. The vanilla I thought I had in the nose doesn't show up on my palate. Bitter bite on the finish. This isn't a complex stout, and that's okay.     F: A smooth 10%'er. Fairly creamy as well.     O: I have been wanting to try this one for a while. Recently received as an extra and was glad to try it. Bottom line: This is a no frills stout. That isn't a negative. It's straight forward and exactly what you'd expect. Is it exciting? No. But it's a well made example of a style we all enjoy in these cooler months.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Look: Oil black with a very dark tan, slowly developing head and lingering lacing and bubbles	  Smell: Sweet roasted malt and a bit of dark fruit	  Taste: bottled 9/3/2015. Sweet gentle roastiness, dark fruit, chocolatey, moderate bitterness in the finish with the lingering roasted malt. A bit tingly, but the alcohol is otherwise not too noticeable. Great balance.	  Feel: Full bodied, thick with light, fine carbonation. Excellent	    Overall: Given the reviews I read about Expedition I expected it to be much less balanced 2.5 months after bottling. It sounds like some people think it's too hoppy initially? However, I think it is already a very finely balanced beer, on par with Old Rasputin or Narwhal. I would say that anyone who likes those two beers shouldn't hesitate to grab a 6 pack of Expedition. I look forward to trying it with a little more age, but it's nice to know it's so good right off the shelf.

As it warms fig, prune and molasses present on the nose. Taste is dark brown sugar balance by aggressive hop bitterness with hints of dried fruit. The booze brings a rich fruitcake to mind. Bitterness lingers on the finish.

I tasted plum and cherry up front, followed by a nice building chocolate roasty flavor that lingered on the finish. Creamy mouthfeel and full bodied. Beautiful.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Reviewing a three-month-old 2016 version. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a 13 ounce tulip. I was able to get the whole beer in the tulip with the head. Pours deep black with about 1/2 inch dark brown head that dissipated quickly. There is a ton of cocoa on the nose and a very little bit of dark fruits. The taste is deep, burnt roasty malt flavor with deep chocolate flavor blending perfectly. There is also a slight hoppy bitterness and the dark fruit is lingering underneath. The mouthfeel is thick and silky smooth. Overall this beer is unreal, especially for how easy it is to get. I had a 2013 a week ago. The hoppy bitterness had faded and the score went up to a 4.75 for me.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 I bought two of these on 11/6/15. I opened one on the same day and poured into a snifter. Thick black color with no head but nice lacing. Smells of heavy roasted malt and coffee. The taste is very bitter just as Bell's stated it would be without aging. I enjoyed this "fresh" one, and I'm looking forward to revisiting my second one after its aged a bit.

look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A: [5.00] The beer looks jet black in the glass. It pours out with 1 finger of dense mocha head. The head looks like it could easily support the bottle cap. The bottle lists the ABV (10.5%) and a label printed packaged date (9/11/15).    S: [3.75] Dark fruit. Bittersweet chocolate.     T: [4.50] Really nice chocolate flavor up front. Hints of coffee. Mild charred hardwood. Toasted marshmallows. Finishes with malty sweetness.    M: [4.25] Thick, creamy mouthfeel. No alcohol on the palate but I get it slightly in the back of the throat.     O: [4.25] This is a damn near perfect stout. My only quibble is that I wish the nose offered slightly more. Visually it is perfect and very appealing. The taste is magnificent with chocolate, coffee and campfire all playing along with malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy. This is definitely on my short list for best stouts.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 12 ounce bottle dated 9/9/14, poured into snifter. Like most stouts, this one definitely improves as it warms. The distinct feature on this one is definitely the mouthfeel. It's got a noticeably higher viscosity, something of which I prefer in a beer. The thicker and heavier it is, the better. Above average flavors, though I don't taste many of notes others suggest (A little chocolate and coffee, but definitely not any marshmallow or caramel). It's a well balanced brew. Wish I had more to imbibe. Happy National Stout Day!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Current release poured into stout glass following 30th anniversary.    Pours black but slightly thin and with a lighter head.    Flavor is solid but not overly complex. Typical roasty malts, lots of coffee and some burnt chocolate.    Feel is a touch light and on the syrupy side.    Will be aging the rest and will revisit in years to come. For now, very good stout, fantastic. But 30th edges it out.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 Batch 13415 bottled 8/22/14.    Served slightly chilled into a goblet. Expedition Stout is a deep dark brown, almost black, color with thin tan head that settles fairly fast.    Aroma is full of dark roasted malts, cocoa, and coffee. There is also some dark fruits and black cherries.    Flavor is bold and intense. There are all the classic stout flavors of dark chocolate, dark roasted malts, and coffee. Also, more subtle notes of cherries.    Mouthfeel is wonderfully full bodied and perfectly carbonated.    Overall a classic verision of the style and perfectly executed. Really nice after a year of aging in the cellar.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 First taste of the 2015 batch and I am not disappointed. My first review will have to be somewhat biased because I am fully aware of what this beer will become with time.   From a 12oz. bottle into the snifter. It pours like thin tar, absolutely no light pierces through this beer. Holding the flashlight of my phone up to the glass, the light is completely obliterated by the depth of this stout. Almost no head exists with this beer. A swivel of the glass brings some foam to life that dissipates rapidly leaving a very roasted/espresso colored lacing crawling down the sides. It smells amazing! Tons of coffee and I mean that is about all I smell. Some chocolate, more heavily roasted coffee and some black cherries. And the flavor is just what I expected...COFFEE! Man, that is delicious! I scored this a little lower than it deserves simply because I know it will get even better, but damn I can't wait for a few years on this; it is very good right now. It was slightly colder than it should have been when I started, and now than its warming up the mouth feel is getting creamier and smoother. Tons of cherries and chocolate come through the warmer it gets and the bitterness that was all coffee fades into a dessert of sweet, sweet black deliciousness. It's like two beers in one. I'll have to review the 2014 in comparison. This is awesome...seek and destroy. Cheers!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from 12-ounce bottle (dated 9/18/14) into snifter. Opaque dark-coffee color, with aromas of burnt caramel and dark fruit. Amazingly complex, with flavors of roasted malts, burnt coffee, dark fruit, and even a little bit of sour cherry as it warms on the palate. Thick and syrupy in body, burnt coffee bitterness on the finish. The alcohol presence is evident, but nowhere near what you would expect from the high (10.5) ABV. One of the finest Russian Imperial Stouts I have tried and well-deserving of its world-class ranking.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Black very cloudy body, dark tan prodigious head with great sticky thick lacing. Nose carries roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit, coffee, hop acidity and pine. The palate turns up bitter burnt malt, a fair portion of vanilla (the only widely accessible flavor encountered), bitter chocolate mixed with hop acidity and bitterness, smoke, faint blackberry, and on an adventurous/bad note alcohol and faint acetone appear on the finish. Kinda messy, meaning every sip is different and none are balanced between the wide array of flavors, but spinning the slots with this one is damn fun. This brew is medium bodied, with a slight oily/resinous quality that coats the tongue.  I can definitely see the cellar potential, but right off the fermenter this is a pretty awesome brew. Lots of bold flavors that don't care to play fair with each other but somehow mix well together. Dope.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 12oz, dated 10/23/2014 (a year old); snifter. Pours like milk chocolate, with a nice light caramel-colored head that didn't last more than 30 seconds, but a smallish amount of bubbles remained around the edge, and when swirled it leaves a nice lacing effect that slowly dissipates. Strong aroma of dark fruits, with a bit of alcohol burn on the nose (literally!), together which somewhat reminds me of an old ale. The taste has everything I expect in an imperial stout: a tasty complexity of dark malts balanced nicely with the hops, with a dry/bitter finish. Full, creamy, and clean mouth-feel.     After months of first reading about it I finally got to try the legendary Expedition Stout, and I have to say it didn't disappoint. I had it hours after having had Bell's Neptune, and Expedition Stout is by far the superior beer. This beer is clearly one of the best imperial stouts I have ever had. I look forward to seeing how this ages.

Outstanding beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Bottled 9/18/2014. Very dark, nearly opaque stout. Light tan head with lots of visible carbonation floating up the glass. For a one year old bottle, the hop presence is still strong, mostly fruity which blends well with the dark plum/raisin characteristics to add sweetness. Subtle chocolate and roasted malt notes. Smells to me like a very big, thick black IPA. Perfect carbonation for a full bodied beer. The traits of a bold imperial stout come through more in the flavor. A bitter roastiness, burnt caramel, baker's chocolate, licorice, and dark fruit/earthy hops. Usually not a fan of the hoppy imperial stouts but this one is executed very well. Reminiscent of Victory's Storm King, just stickier, with more complexity and aggression.

Finishes with a smoky element to it, retaining a bitter coffee after taste.    Mouthfeel- Heavy in body, some carbonation. Alcohol warmth.    Overall- A fine stout with full flavor. This one really has a coffee chocolate blend to it. Well crafted stout.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I imagine this would be quite good with some age on it. I had only a sample on draft, and perhaps there was an issue with the line, but behind the malty taste was an almost medicinal flavor.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 A - Pitch black pour with a generously thick one fingered toffee colored head. Very, very sticky on the sides of the glass.    S - Deep roasted dark chocolate with some toffee, char, mocha coffee, and molasses.    T - Dark chocolate, mocha, some coffee bitterness, a little bit of cream, some char, but overall - dominated by dark chocolate roast, some booziness. The finish is extremely nice with a long lingering dark chocolate/mocha roast lingering bitterness.     M - The mouth is coated with a thick layer of dark chocolate and bittersweet mocha, big and full bodied, silky, slippery, lip smacking sticky.    O - Always a great stout, just wish the price on the six-packs were less.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 12 oz. bottle dated 08/29/13. Poured into a Duvel glass. Pours a very dark, syrupy brown and settles abosloutely black in the glass. An aggressive pour yielded a 2 finger heas of dense & sticky tan foam. Fairly strongly aroma of roasted malt, bitter chocolate, caramel, coffee, and vanilla. Heavy weight and very smooth and creamy on the mouthfeel. Bittersweet chocolate/cocoa and expresso up front on the taste with a slight bitterness. Middleways, notes of cinammon and vanilla are tossed into the mix with an increasing bitterness and a creeping alcohol burn. A continuing bitterness on the back end with strong coffee and expresso notes. Finishes fairly smooth and leaves a profound booziness behind on the aftertaste.    Weird beer. Great aroma ans flavors, but even at nearly 2 years old this thing is still bitter beyond belief. It honestly made my lips tingle a little bit. A bit off center from a traditional standard, but still damn good. I'd put this one up there with FIS and Old Rasp.

Smells roasty with some dark fruit sweetness. Tastes a little fruity and sweet at first but then there's a big rush of bitter. Aftertaste of bitter black coffee. Packaged 10/3/2016. I've got another one in the cellar, so I'll see how it tastes with a year of age on it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12oz bottle courtesy of LehighAce06 as part of his battery of (mostly) Michigan beers that he sent me as part of NBS BIF # 2. Another Bell’s beer that I had wanted for a long time! According to the label, this was bottled August 22, 2014. Hmm. Pre-aged for your pleasure…    Poured into a Jones Radiator mug, this is a very dark brown, with a big, foam head that is colored somewhere between tan and mocha. Said head left lots of lace on the sides of the glass, and fell rather quickly – not a surprise given the potency of this brew.    Big nose of molasses, coffee and booze, but the coffee isn’t nearly as pronounced as other reviewers indicate – maybe because mine has been sitting for nearly a year, it’s mellowed a bit. Still, the other aspects of the nose give it a suitably unsubtle but tasty aroma – like all good Imperial Stouts!    The flavor does more to convince me this is mellower than it would be when fresh. The mollassly-brown sugar thing leads the flavor charge, backed up by booze, dark chocolate and coffee (in pretty much that order). In the background there’s some figgy-pruny things happening as well, along with notes of pipe tobacco (Referencing a forum rant someone made - Yeah, I’ve smoked a pipe, mentioning that in flavor terms isn’t being pretentious, it’s coming from my own experience). There’s a mild, hoppy zap at the swallow, but it’s nearly buried in sweet and bitter malt flavors that give off a kind of coffee ice cream aftertaste.    Full bodied, with spot-on carbonation and a creamy, coating mouthfeel.    I really, really like this beer. It’s ridiculously drinkable for a 10+% stout, without seeming like a dumbed down version of the style. In a weird reversal of how things usually go, I find myself wishing I had a fresh, harsher version so I could compare it to this slightly-aged version. I may have to trade for this again (or pick up a few bottles if I ever get back to Michigan), so I’ll be leaving it on my “wants” until further notice.

Smells of coffee chocolate and roasted malt. Tastes of chocolate, licorice strong bitterness (which I expect would mellow out very nicely as the beer ages longer), alcohol present but not overpowering the other flavors, extremely smooth outbreak, rolls down your throat. I will definitely go get another one of these to age longer.
