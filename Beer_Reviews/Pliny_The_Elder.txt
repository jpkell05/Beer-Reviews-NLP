look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 July 27th, 2015 - The time has come for Pliny the Elder, straight from the font. It's a legendary beer, and looks resplendent in its throne here in Santa Rosa. With a slightly sweeter smell exceptionally balanced against hops, the flavor is immensely deep. Even though I tend to enjoy hoppy brews more for the bouquet than the taste, this offers plenty of both. Sweeter, like a broiled grapefruit, it plays with its ethanol quite well. In contention for my favorite California IPA, it is only rivaled by the Blind Pig. And as I try to determine which I prefer, I suckle on the aftertaste which is punching and long, with a slightly resinous note to enjoy. It is one of the perfect IPAs, rare best served chilled, straight here at the tap.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 510ml with a bottled on date of 1-22-19 (opened 2-2-19).  Golden, pale - clean. Active carbonation lifting a 1 1/2" white head. Good retention and thick, foamy lace.  Classic. WC aromas of pine, grapefruit, lime, citrus, hint of pineapple - clean, fresh hop aromas!  Bright flavors match the aroma, full of fresh fruit and citrus...  8% is undetectable, as delicious as this is I'd be on the floor before figuring it out.  Bright, clean entry with a medium body, medium carbonation, and a LONG and flavorful finish.   True classic and a pleasure to drink anytime.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25 Straight pour from a 1 pt 1.25 oz/510 ml pry-off bottle to a teku. This has a bottling date of January 08, 2019 printed in white ink near the bottom-left corner of the front label (“BOTTLED ON: 010819”), making this beer just under three weeks old at the time of consumption. Purchased cold, coming right out of the box on its way to the cooler.     Appearance (4.25): A solid three fingers of eager, whipped foam the color of custard comes right off of the pour, capping a crystal-clear, 24 ct. gold-colored body. The head dies down slowly, leaving a pock-marked cap and scattered legs of wide, foamy splotches that look like an archipelago of coral atolls. It dies down almost completely after some time, but still shows good retention.     Smell (4.25): A radiant, clean blend of citrusy fruit (even amounts of ripe pineapple flesh, navel orange zest, and kumquat) and a slurry of herbaceous and resinous notes (pine needles, fresh cut grass, and some ganja for good measure) dominate the nose. Very light, clean grain appears as well, offering a crisp, clean note of common crackers alongside stale, floury pita bread—just very clean, plain flatbread. This is all quite faint in the face of the bouquet of hops here, though.     Taste (4.5): Compared to the nose, the palate is (at first) dominated by ganja and pine, offering dank, resinous bitterness flanked by lightly astringent conifers and a hint of earthy spice, like rich tobacco leaf. It does have undertones of bright citrus, with a soft pineapple sweetness nearly obscured by the aforementioned resin while strong, pink grapefruit pith rises out of that bitterness and continues to ring loud and clear, long into the lingering finish (which itself trails off quite evenly and slowly, fading away with no sudden drop-off). There is a bit of grain hidden in here, again offering that plain but earthy feel of multigrain flatbread with a dry, slightly starchy, floury finish, but it really is dominated by the array of bitter notes that fan out from the middle of the palate all the way through to the finish. No sign of booze. It’s shockingly dry and clean, frankly.     Mouthfeel (5.0): Carbonation washes in with a soft, medium-grit body of gentle bubbles that tingle happily as they cover all surfaces. It easily holds up the body, which feels medium-weight but on the light- side of full thanks to just how dry and crisp it is. That carbonation foams up easily, floating all of the bitter hop compounds before they settle in and feel too astringent. Still, that bitterness really dries out the body, bringing it from medium-weight and crisp to almost vaporous. Again, no sign of booze.     Overall (4.25): What is this beer? The archetypal West Coast (D)IPA, in its most balanced, clean, crisp, and clear form. It’s not my favorite beer ever in that category, because I’ve had others that evoke bombast and utilize unexpected combinations of flavors and aromas—and those are the ones that typically stick with me longer. They may not be the best of the best within this substyle, because they often are prone to some imbalance and the more interesting they are, the more it feels like comparing them is an apples and oranges scenario. This, however, may be near the top of that substyle, thanks to its balance, very obvious technical precision in its brewing and production, and masterful use of hops to deliver a big, powerful bitterness without feeling too challenging (if you like hops). You don’t need me to recommend this beer. Of course you should try it. Will it change your world? Maybe not in 2019, but it’s worth trying to understand why it ruled the world in 2009—and it’s an amazing drink in its own right, even today, any day of the week.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Look: Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Very light coloring, head dissipates quickly leaving some nice rings.     Smell: Strong smell for the coloring. Initial smell of pine, orange, hops, and some underlying sweetness like caramel.    Taste: Outstanding. Bitter citrus at first, then the hops really come through. Tastes like your typical west coast IPA but with an underlying sweetness that is tough to place. There’s no denying the obvious quality of this beer.    Feel: carbonation is relatively high but pleasant. 8.0% ABV and very drinkable. Mouthfeel is a bit oily and sticky but it goes down very easy.    Overall: I wanted to try this because of the hype and was able to find it at a local health food grocery store. There was a limit of 2 per person. Typically, hype ruins things for me, but my first thought was ‘damn that’s good.’ If you’re able to find this mythical unicorn of a beer, don’t hesitate!

It pours a crystal clear, golden-straw color with a large, fluffy, bright white cap and copious, soapy lacing. Large numbers of tiny bubbles ascend the glass. The nose features lemon and grapefruit. It's extremely crisp and clean. This is as clean and bitter as they come. There is tart, bitter citrus. The Amarillo, Centennial, CTZ, and Simcoe hops are amazingly flavorful and provide a strong, bitter bite. It's the quintessential West Coast IPA. It is crisp and dry with an easy drinking 8% ABV. I don't know what more I can say; this is truly exquisite as fine an IPA as you'll find. I'm grateful to have tried it. Thanks, Josh!

Pours a clear medium, wedding band, gold.The pour produces 2+ fingers of fluffy, moderately lasting, white head which leaves behind clumpy, sticky lacing. Super aroma with kaleidoscopic hoppiness: Pine, grapefruit, and thin tropical; sweet caramel malt and a earthy, leafy, herbal tea-like note. Taste is grapefruit and pine from start to finish back by malty caramel sweetness, a hint of toast and the leafy tea-like hint is there too. Very resinous. Mouthfeel is lighter than I would have thought but still medium bodied with good carbonation, a little sticky and oily but smooth. Among the finest IPAs.

People compare it to Hop Stoopid, and while I'll readily admit that there are a lot of similarities between the two, I think this one is far more balanced. Here goes:    A: Very good. Relatively clear yellow-orange; body looks quite nice. It pours a large head that leaves a ton of lacing; the body carbonation is also decent. Again, very good.    S: Only OK part of the beer. Some dankness, but only very lightly so. Some pine and grapefruit, but not much else.    T: Very good. Refreshing and well-balanced. Lots of piney sweetness, some grapefruit (but not overwhelming), and a fair portion of tropical fruits. The sticky, sweet pine is the most prominent flavor. Great mixture of sweet and hoppy flavors. I liked it a lot.    F: Perfect. Very drinkable.    O: A great beer.

That's a scary thought. One of the best West coast IPAs out there!

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a medium straw color, very clear, lots of carbonation bubbling up, foamy head recedes appropriately. Nice piney hop aroma with a touch of citrus. Pretty flavorful, hops provide plenty of bitterness with a piney flavor, lingering bitterness on the finish. Carbonation is present but not overpowering. Overall a solid DIPA, but today there's lots of great beer being made locally that I prefer. I get the high rating, and I am sure 10-15 years ago this was sought after. Not so much anymore. Worth trying if you come across it, but not worth hunting down.    9/5/18  Bottle dated 6/29/18 - thanks Adam!  4 rating

Taste follows the smell with nice, strong citrus notes, mostly grapefruit because of the medium to high bitterness.     This beer was 10 months old sitting in my fridge and it was really fresh tasting. I can see why it has a following and this is among the best west coasts I've had. Being out east I feel privileged to get one. Thanks to my bro's ex gf who flew some back from a business trip :)

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Pouring from a 510 ml. bottle into a snifter glass. This beer pours out extremely clear (which I love) and golden in color, resembling apple juice. It forms a rocky and dense one finger white crown. The smell is a beautiful sweet smelling element like honey and comes in with slight resin and pine. Almost reminds me of hopslam based on the smell. The taste comes in a little more bland than expected. It has some "crystal" sharpness, if that's right. Seems like a lot of crystal malt was used. I wish it was either more dank/piney or had more sweetness. It has a sticky mouthfeel throughout but finishes dry. Overall, with no disrespect, can somebody bring me a Hopslam?   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Bottled on 07/19/18, poured into a sniffer glass. Looks like a copper orange combo. Smells like grapefruit, pineapple and a hint of pine. Has a slight hop bitterness up front followed up with grapefruit and pineapple going down. What I love about Pliny the elder is the smoothness, it goes down dry and easy. I would drink this every week if it was more available.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured from 510ml bottle into Guinness pint glass.    L - Straw gold pour with minimal white lacing on top.    S - Citrus peel. fresh pink grapefruit, slight pine notes.    T - Pithy grapefruit, spruce needles; bitter, but not oppressive.    F - Stinging hop oils in the front, with a dry finish.    O - A quintessential IPA (DIPA). It's powerful, but forgiving. Fairly well balanced hop profile. leaning on the citrus-y side.

Great aroma, good blend of citrus and bitter flavors from the hops. Definitely great, not sure it is as legendary as people make it seem.

Smell: Hops scent with heavy malty feel in the nostrils. Comes and goes and wish it was a touch more potent.     Taste: Citrus and woody flavor, you taste heavy grapefruit with a shuttle sweetness with doses of malt. It's good and real good but not the best I've had.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 In my opinion, Pliny the Elder is the epitome of what a strong IPA should be. What makes it great is the combination of a big character & taste, with unparalleled balance & restraint. A trifecta of piney hop bitterness with a touch of tropical fruit, a sturdy tasty malt foundation, and a slightly boozy & dry alcohol strength. This is not an extreme, experimental, or revolutionary IPA. Rather, it is simply an everyday, after-work strong IPA, made exceptionally well.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Can't add anything that hasn't been said, so I'll just put my thoughts in.  Smells of pine and earthy hops. Malts were subtle, yet present. Taste was mostly pine and malt. Carbonated, and bitter.. with the bitterness dropping off quickly. That's the best part about this beer.. it hits you and lets you enjoy the wham of bitterness.. yet lets you off the hook to get back to drinking more.

I have had this beer on numerous occasions and I will say that after about 30 days, the nose tends to open up more and that beautiful character really starts to shine.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Just perfect. On tap at the incomparable Monk's, in Philadelphia.    Look is gorgeous clear golden nectar.    Smell is bright with pine and grapefruit, with lingering citrus and a depth of dank hops.    Taste is bright and clean, in waves of pine and citrus, especially grapefruit. Malt is robust and really carries the hops. Finish is super dry with grapefruit pith dominant. That strong bitterness limits "drinkability," insofar as the beer itself sets your pace, encouraging you to wait, let the full flavor develop and dissipate on the palate, and then go in for another sip after due time. In this, Pliny differs from its best New England siblings (you know who I mean), which tend to invite you back for quick sipping. I appreciate Pliny's maturity on this front.    Feel is medium bodied but thoroughly satisfying. Beautiful carbonation lifting up all that intense flavor and aroma.    Overall: Supreme. A total pleasure to spend time with this masterpiece.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 As good as it gets, consistency is the key and this hits every one of the catagories hard. Aroma starts with a smooth pine smell. Taste has several layers that encompass pine hops, all the way down to some flavour of apple, lime and pine apple. Highly recommended. Easy to get in California. Love it on tap

Now I came upon this brew about 2.5 weeks ago, when my new best friend Daniel asked me if I liked beer. I informed him of my beer reviewing hobby, and he proceeded to show me two bottles of this rare beauty he had just gotten from a friend. I was flabbergasted when he gave me one, just to spread the love. Thank you, Daniel. This review is for you.    Unfortunately, I have no idea what this little bottle went through before he became mine, and the bottling date is 9/1/17, which is well over six months ago. Absolute sacrilege, considering the label decor which clearly emphasizes the importance of freshness to the experience of this beer.    L: It pours with an opaque orange body like a Hefeweizen. The goblet holds precious little lacing from the finger of head that rises from the pour. The bubbles are extremely fine. So is the haze.     S: This is a very mild DIPA. I would even expect that I would say the same of it when fresh. Peach, mango, banana, apricot, plum, lemon, thyme, cooked onion and some very mild bread character are detectable on the nose, but nothing jumps out.    T: This certainly does a fantastic job of hiding the alcohol. Nothing particularly striking in the flavor, but enough of it to hold an 8% brew together. The onion/garlic richness and some oxidized peach take the lead, followed by a building herbal hop bitterness from thyme that ends in sweet honey and wheat bread. Very much like Hopslam. Hopslam is better. Actually this brew doesn't even make my list of top 10 DIPAs.    F: The texture is thick and smooth, but a bit of cloying sweetness lingers on the tongue, exacerbating the nausea from its sweetness. For the reputation, I’m not impressed.    O: If this beer did not carry such a reputation, I would probably be impressed. That said, if this is the best the world of beer can offer, I am sorely disapppinted. Fortunately, it isn't, at least by my taste. For certain I still need to try it fresh, but I honestly doubt that even the day after bottling that it would be hands down the best in the world. Rather than seeking out this rare whale, I recommend trying something more available, like West Coast IPA. Or Hop Stoopid. Or Pure Hoppiness. Or Enjoy By. Or Hoptimum. Solid B (86%)

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 This beer pours a bright clear gold with a solid head. The aroma is classic through and through, with notes of grapefruit pith, orange peel, pink grapefruit flesh, and pine. The flavor is utterly clean and classic, with bold bitterness, grapefruit peel, orange peel, dry pine, juniper, and dry caramel. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with plenty of carbonation and a dry, bitter finish. Overall this is a spectacular beer. I have tasted before but this is my first full one. It really does live up to its reputation - there is nothing unique here, but it is instead a near perfect example of its style.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 I quit drinking 5 years ago, after having meticulously rated hundreds of beers. The white whale I could never catch was Pliny The Elder. But now I'm back, this once, for one last dance.    Pliny The Elder. 510mL bottled 02/12/18, 16 days ago. Poured into a Duvel snifter. Mailed in wine shipper by an amazing friend.    Appearance - Pours a big creamy off-white head with fine lacing. Swirling readily generates head. Deep gold body with slight, fine bubbling only at the snifter's etching.    Smell - Heavy grass. Bucolic liveliness appropriate for the coming of spring.    Taste - Very grassy hop with just enough malt underneath to balance the profile. The alcohol is impressively well hidden for such a high ABV beer. Aftertaste has a pleasantly bitter bite. No off tones throughout.    Mouthfeel - Astonishingly silky for the style. Crisp finish.     Overall - Extremely well balanced DIPA. No negative or conspicuous features of any kind. Best described as a standard DIPA without any faults.    5/5

It's still too hoppy. There's really no call for it, but at least they've managed to get it balanced so that you get an interesting, complex and still drinkable flavor. Equally hoppy beers exist, but they are almost always undrinkable. This one isn't. The hype surrounding it isn't warranted, but it's a good beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25 This beer is a classic. A trendsetting brew, the first double ipa.

Well, at least I suggested that to the guy outside who checked me in..

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottled 4/5/18.  Look: Dark straw color with unfiltered appearance. 1 finger worth of head from a very slow pour. Loads of lacing on the glass.   Smell: Nice hop profile up front, with loads of pine. Hops are present in an earthy/grassy fashion, with some floral aspects. Some citrus on the nose, but the hops and pine are dominant.   Taste: Follows the nose. Bright earthy hops with loads of pine on the back end. I do get a little more orange and lemon on the flavor than I do with the nose, which is pleasant. The hops are dominant, but very smooth and balanced. For a DIPA, it is very smooth and not overly bitter.   Feel: Medium in body and light to medium in weight, with moderate carbonation. It does have a nice full feel to the beer, and is somewhat soft, despite bitter fizz. Very enjoyable feel.   Overall: This beer is famous for a reason, and it is deserving of its notoriety. For a double, it is so darn smooth, and full of a nice hop/pine flavor. Each time I drink it, it always lives up to my expectations. I am grateful to have tried this beer, and to be able to find this regularly. Cheers!

I might prefer the more intense taste of others out there at times, but this is definitely one of the best.

Nothing really stood out. Had fresh at the brewery, brought home bottles and hosted a tasting with a nice assortment of Vermont IPA's, and two Tree House brews. Pliny was at the bottom of the heap, universally. Wanted to be blown away, but it just didn't do it. Granted the style is different from New England IPA's.

Light blond clear pour, minimal head and carbonation. Strong pine aroma, hops, mixture of sweet and strong hops. One of the strongest aromas from a beer I have ever had. Hops and pine predominant tastes. Strong mouth feel, firm, dry pleasant drinking. Overall excellent beer, thanks David for the tip!

You get a beer that is 8% + and doesn't have a bitterness....  THAT IS IT.    PLEASE STOP with this whole best beer ever crap.    This beer gives you not much flavor.  Yes it's lacking flavor. It's just simply not what you could imagine. I love that it has low bitterness at 8% that is great... but guess what. So do ALOT of beers at this level.  So pliny you are not worth the greatness in Oregon at least. Take a back seat..

Its an awesome beer when you can get your hands on some, and never let it age, the quality suffers quickly.

If you can understand the difference, and why that matters, then maybe we can all stop hyping Pliny so much. Still, if you can get your hands on this beer, do so. You won’t be disappointed.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Difficult to find fault with this one.    Pours a lovely golden with a finger of thick white foam which remains as a cap the whole way down. Bands of lace remain in the beer's dissipating wake.    Smells dank, piney of overripe fruit.     Tastes fruity, piney, resinous, dank. Slick mouthfeel. Great light bready backbone. Emphatically bitter. Smooth. Far too easy to drink. Alcohol not detectable until the long, bitter, resinous finish. Towards the end of the glass, the bitterness vanishes and it's just smooth hoppy goodness.    Epitomy of the West Coast IPA.

Its a DIPA thats smooth and not crazy hoppy while maintaining sort of a floral backend to it. Its light and easy to drink but I find myself wondering if this beer was easily accessible, would it still have the same ratings here?

No sticky lacing. Aroma is an even blend of pine and citrus. Taste is similar, nice and bitter, but no real juiciness to this. Feel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. My favorite part about this is the semi-dry finish. Overall, good, not great. Try it if you've been looking but definitely lower expectations.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Bottled a month ago and tasted alongside a 5-week-old bottle of Blind Pig    L -- Filtered orange body with a two-finger solid white head produced with moderately aerated pour. Good retention and great lacing. A little paler than Blind Pig, which was surprising. Bottle is like the Dr. Bronner's of beer   S -- Grapefruit, new sneaker, pine, pineapple, grass, and a touch of booze. Not too in your face, but clean   T -- Starts semi-sweet, with a pleasant honey sweetness and a wave of white peach and grapefruit hoppiness. This is abruptly followed by a robust, resinous bitterness that continues to the mildly astringent, herbaceous, black-tea-like finish. A hint of green coffee beans as well   F -- Medium+ mouthfeel, medium carb. Booze is a little perceivable. Long-lasting finish   O -- Glad to finally be trying this one. While it is definitely no longer king of the roost, it is beautifully put together given the date of its initial release.    84/100

Aroma is citrus, pine and stone fruit with a hint of candied fruit. Amazing taste. First sip starts bitter pine and grapefruit pith. Strong finishing bitter bite. As it opens up, sweeter citrus and stone fruit comes through. I get a lot of peach. It gets better with every drink. Mouthfeel is medium, smooth, well-carbed and crisp. Outstanding all around beer.

Heavy bodied but the flavours are lighter than expected. Earthy hops, citrusy fresh spruce tips, a bit of passion fruit, some floral notes, and a squishy body throughout. Balanced and well-rounded with a clean finish.

Taste is incredibly smooth. Goes down way too easy. Nice clean bitterness balanced by a very nice malt backbone. One of the most balanced IPAs I've ever had. Pine, floral, caramel, grapefruit taste. Excellent beer. Definitely one of the best.

But as I bring my nose over the glass I am immediately inundated with tart, tropical, tangy, and resinous goodness. Kiwi, key lime, raspberry, hint of pine. All of it is underpinned by a clean sweetness.    T: dank! Arrival is immediately hoppy, citrus, grapefruit peel, mild, crackery maltiness with a hint, just a hint, of sweetness. Balance? No way! But I am surprised by how not bitter it seems. Toward the end it becomes less citrusy and more piney, and then dank - more herbal tasting than any beer I have ever had.     M: lighter side of medium, modest carbonation, pretty darned attenuated and only a little slick.    O: I would say this lives up to the hype. It is a crisp, clean, and super hoppy DIPA with no presence of alcohol whatsoever and not much bitterness. It is the definition of the west coast IPA.     Basically every IPA (and most pale ales) I've had over the last year are trying to be this. Five years ago I can only imagine what this was like to the devoted hop head. Alas, I am not a devoted hop head. An extremely generous friend brought this home for me, and for that I am endlessly grateful. However time and travel do this beer no favors. I have had better Bodhi, and Mystic Mama that comes darn close. Hope to have it in Cali someday, for the sake of comparison.

TASTE: tropical fruit, hair spray hops, good, but not amazing.  FEEL: disappointed in the carbonation, knowing Russian rivers other beers. Medium body and smooth.    Certainly a very good beer. The aroma is my favorite attribute. Much like Heady Topper, I am similarly not as impressed as the general imbibing public.    Tasty nonetheless.    **

Drink it cold and fresh. I'd tell you where I found it, but I can't. This is my happy place. Though I'm 3000 miles away, I need to know there will be some left there on tap if I ever return. If you can find Pliny, drink it. It is the Holy Grail of beers!

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 This beer has a hazy golden look with a thin layer of head floating above that dissipates in about 3 minutes. The first sip was delicious in every aspect. It has an original thought out balance between a citrusy sweet and an excellence of hoppiness. It finishes with a hoppy finish on the back of the tongue going down and a spirited aroma going through the noise.     This beer by Russian River Brewing Company is a one of a kind brew that should be tried by all beer connoisseurs!   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pours a somewhat hazy golden color and leaves the same color body with a one and a half finger white foamy head that dissipates within less than a minute, carbonation is seen rising, light lacing is left in the wake but not that much as I thought I would have seen; the aroma has a combined citrus and piney hops up front and very powerful that it lasts through the entire drink, however, there are some malts that do come through ever so lightly as it warms; the flavoring is mainly bitter but has a light citrus sweetness comes through in the malts, strong bitter citrus/pine aftertaste, super dry finish; its somewhat easy on the palate or as much as a DIPA can be and assaults the palate as a superior DIPA should; overall, a superior DIPA that I would very much have again if available, but I got this in a trade and wouldn’t mind having it again   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 On tap to pint glass at Monk's Cafe (Philly). Clear amber with lots of retention. Lots of pine and sweet aromas in nose.   Bitter but well balanced. Citrus, mango, berry flavors. Sweet viscous vanilla and pine in flavor. Smooth syrupy finish. Lots of alcohol. Very drinkable. Excellent IPA.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Bottled 050517, after wanting to try it for several years now I was shocked to find a bottle.    One finger of thick white head atop a clear golden glass of ale with okay lacing. Resin, sap, chamomile and dandelion flowers, onion and garlic, pine, orange peel, prickly pear, tomato, alfalfa and the most brief scent of lilac fill the nose, with fresh bready malt in the background which smells a little more like sweet donuts after it warms slightly. It tastes extremely bright at the start then slightly malty, and very pleasantly bitter throughout, with a bunch of the orange, grass, and resin aromas coming through excellently with very subtle rosemary, kiwi, caramelized onion or fresh garlic, and lemon poppy seed muffin batter flavors. Big resinous, sappy, crisp and fresh flavors over top flaky biscuits which seems hectic for a moment before dissipating into a soft, very long-lasting citrusy bitterness. Creamier carbonation, but almost oily mouthfeel and frail influence from the alcohol all around, or at least until I reached the last lukewarm gulp where it showed a bit stronger.    An incredibly jubilant yet comforting beer, I can't get over how pleasurable it is to drink and it's phenomenal hoppiness and maltiness. An outrageous surprise from my trip to Colorado, not just because I got to bring it back home but also because of how marvelous an IPA it is.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Finally!! Picked up this beauty at Vendome Wine & Spirits in Beverly Hills, CA. Poured into a Bruges glass, Bottles On date was 04/24/17. 8% ABV.    Look: Deep golden hue, small head of foam, even carbonation flow from the base of the glass.  Smell: An incredible combination of sweet breadiness, bitter citrus, and piney hops. Beautiful floral balance.  Taste: An amazing hop explosion. Loads of grapefruit give a perfect balance to piney, resinous hops. Still a subtle breadiness, but just as a noticeable afterthought to the beauty that is Pliny!  Feel: Very smooth. Sharp, seltzery carbonation that is very smooth as it goes down. Incredibly crisp, the perfect summer IPA (that for many is a one summer in a lifetime).    Okay so as I predicted, this beer is far from overrated. Its balance is incredible, and true hopheads will be able to truly appreciate the bitter grapefruit, herbs, and piney hops all being perfectly balanced into an amazingly easy drinking DIPA. If you ever get your hands on this, don't pass it up. The fact that you can still grab it for under $10 is beyond me, because I would easily pay more to try this again.    UPDATE: Rating slightly amended on 2/23/18.. still an amazing beer but a 5 across the board is unrealistic, even for Pliny.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 On tap in a pint glass. Glad to finally have the opportunity to try this one (thank you Denver). Pours a straw yellow with a touch or orange. Dank and resinous. I expected more complexity from this beer - particularly given its pedigree - but it tends more towards one not, which it hits, and hits well. This beer trends more towards the blend of dank, thick, and piny that Heady hit so well, and did it well before that time. It's a great piece of craft beer history, and still holds up well, but though it's an exceptional beer, it's no longer one (in my opinion) that warrants a place among the best of the best. Though it may have been the first, many breweries have come along, duplicated, and improved upon what this beer had going. Excellent, but no longer world-class.

Pours a bubbly, soapy head that fades a bit but is easily coaxed back by swirling.  S: Bread and earthy, almost like a nice bread baked with basil and other herbs. Slightly sweet aroma with minor hints of ethanol, has a bright citrus zest note.  T: Repeat of nose with bread and earthy flavor. However hops come through here with notes of citrus, mostly a sweet grapefruit rind note. Finishes with a very soft bitterness. To me, its impressive that this bitterness is so soft, and this is coming from a New England boy.  F: Ridiculously smooth. Mouthfeel is soft, smooth, and easy-drinking. There's a bit of a crispness from the carbonation but its pretty balanced. Very refreshing. Only critique would be that its a bit thin  O: Extremely good beer, has a good malt/hop balance, very drinkable, very tasty. If this was readily available it would be a summer staple of mine.

Very floral nose with some pine and a touch of citrus peel. Won't know you're drinking a DIPA, as finishes much cleaner and lighter than most. I'll admit that for me it didn't live up to the hype, but a very clean, crisp and bright beer. Definitely deserves accolades, but by no means blew me away. However, it's a pioneer beer for the style and I certainly wouldn't turn it away if offered.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Well where to start with this one..... hands down one of the best beers if not the best out there. This one definitely did not disappoint. The look was absolutely beautiful and crisp like a diamond. The smell was beyond what you would get with a typical DIPA a semi hoppy and friendly scent. The taste was probably the best part about this because the taste was so fresh and so delightful that grapefruit and the fresh hops and pine flavors all go extremely well together. The feel and finish was somewhat on the dry and somewhat bitter side I almost couldn't tell that it was this smooth. Overall one of the most if not the most beautiful and freshest, crisp, and clean beers ever created and does more than check all of the boxes when looking for a nice and fancy beer. I recommend to all to try it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Had it a few times on draft and a few times from a bottle poured into a pint glass. I don't have much to add to the multiple exhaustive reviews. Currently drinking an extremely fresh one.  I've had to downgrade its rating slightly after trying many other IPAs and DIPAs. However, I still marvel at how complex, yet simple it is. If that seems like an oxymoron, allow me to explain.  It is complex in the depth of its layers. The smell is uber fresh, fruity and hoppy, citrusy and piney, spicy, grassy, woody, and even a little nutty. The flavor starts with a nice bitter grapefruit rind punch along with some apicrot, orange, lemon zest, and pine, and then you notice some grass and herbs, wood resin even. A faint malt sweetness comes into play as well as a dry cracker-like backbone that all serves to mellow out the bitterness, adding texture and body, like soaking up some lemon juice with bread. Finally comes a dry and bitter, fresh grapefruit finish, reminding you again of its primary mission and asking you to take another ride. I don't detect alcohol.  Its simplicity lies in the ease with which these layers are identified -- its lack of busyness. Its mission is singular -- to provide a bitter, fresh, yet balanced and ultimately extremely drinkable DIPA. Each individual attribute may be found to a greater extent in other beers, but its precise balance of attributes is unique and maintains it as the reference standard for DIPAs.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Pours a unblemished golden straw color with a thick frothy white head. Nose is floral, pine with a bit of light citrus. Beautiful taste transition, first you get that smooth light citrus, orange and grapefruit peel, fades to floral and then finishes pine like. Minimal malt profile here but it is still a balanced beer meaning they loaded up this beer on it's malt base almost to the tipping point with hops but stopped short at the Percy amount! Nice clean bitterness to it if you let it sit on your tounge. Mouthfeel starts out sticky but quickly transitions to a crisp bitter clean finish that leaves your palate dry and craving for more Pliny! Excellent beer.

Taste:  Fantastic balance of hops and citrus ending with pine notes.    Feel:  Crisp and clean.    This is a highly sought after beer in San Diego county and hard to come by at times. I've had it on tap and bottled, both have their advantages. If you are a fan of IPAs, Pliny the Elder will not disappoint

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottle dated 2/13 (one month old):  (Revisit 4/4 bottle dated 3/21)  Beer pours gold - like a perfect hue of golden - and very clear. The head buildup is significant on a medium pour, with a combination of soapy and frothy head adorning the clear body. Lacing is quite heavy.    Nose is of floral hops to me. There's a little honey-like sweetness with a bit of spice. I get a little evergreen note with some warmth and effort, not as obvious as others have noted. With this I also get just a slightest note of onion/garlic that some doubles give off.  Revisit: Little more citrus orange rind and light sweet grapefruit pith, and a little more power overall, up a notch    The taste is a little more evident, especially in the pine notes. The beer opens as the nose indicated with a nice honey cracker malty opening. The pine is light on a colder brew, but blooms nicely as the beer warms. A light tickling of the carbonation leads to some anticipation before dissolving into the pine notes. These start more woody, but slowly move up the tree from trunk to green branch to pine needles. Further warmth allows me to note a light tangerine citrus rind note right after the carbonation fades. The malt opening comes out the other side as the bitter flavors fade, though the lingering taste is a woody pine bitterness.  Revisit: maybe I took so long to analyze the first time, I'm thinking the same here, just a little easier to detect.    I honestly expected more from the nose, and my initial sips had me wondering about the hype. But as it hit a more proper temperature, there were some lovely nuances I started to notice. The interplay of malt and bitterness in the middle is fun. I also expected it to be more bitter overall, but I liked the malt component of this beer.

Smell: A bright and citrus smell with some hints of pine.  Taste: Bitter but without bite, if that makes any sense. Pine and grapefruit on the tongue. Finishes dry..

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 On tap, had this right after Pliny the Younger for a side-by-side comparison. Pours a golden orange with a half finger of head. Hops dominate the smell, notes of pine. Medium feel with plenty of carbonation. Taste is mostly hops, notes of pine and citrus, with a bitter finish. Compared to Pliny the Younger, this is more bitter and harsh. Very good, but I think there are other DIPAs that are competitive with this one now.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Bottled on 1/11, enjoyed 5 weeks later. Thanks, Jan! The bottles traveled a long ways to get here and I couldn't be more excited. Aroma of freshly cut citrus and pine needles bursts forth from beneath the cap. Orange gold pour with a frothy white cap that lingers. Taste is pine, orange rind, clementine, grapefruit, papaya over a biscuity malt. Not overly fruity or piney or resiny - just perfectly balanced. The 8% ABV is hidden until there's a bit of warmth at the end of the sip. A real gem.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Guess I'll just throw my voice into a crowded room full of high praise for this beer... this is the third time I've had Pliny and I always find it to be an incredible experience deserving of the laudation it regularly receives from those in the know. From the very first time I had this beer, I knew it was something special, yet so austere and seemingly "simple" that it really does exceed the sum of its parts. Here is potentially the single best double IPA in the world. A consistent, sublime experience captured in a pint glass to be savored and enjoyed. A sincere thank you to my buddy Joe, who bestowed a bottle of this (dated 1/20/17) to me as a quid-pro-quo for shepherding him to and from Logan Airport so he could attend a homebrew release party my buddy and I threw last weekend. Your attendance and contributions are appreciated!    Pours a beautiful, clear golden color with a tight, simple and hugely-retentive head of bone-white foam that laces extremely consistently and never relents throughout the whole pour. Carbonation rises steadily in small streams up from the bottom of my glass and each new pour re-rouses the head with an intense vigor. Pouring the entire bottle in yields a slight bit of haze. What a gorgeous IPA!    The nose is bright and citrus-forward; surprisingly playful and fanciful, with a slight papaya note along with some hay and pine resin. Simple, evocative, devoid of trends... PtE is an exercise in perfect balance and execution, and the nose is no exception by any means. Slightly grassy and even a bit earthy, with some juicy tangerine and clementine in there as well. I'm also getting a bit of green onion, which I know is a note that a lot of people have an issue with, but which I find to be a surprisingly great element that contrasts well with the citrus peel and fleshy, fruity notes here.    Flavor is, of course, heavily bitter and reliant on pine and grapefruit to nail down the palate, though the subtle workings of biscuity, bready malt and the even-handed juicy/tropical aspects really bring the whole thing home. The flavor is probably where the concept of "balance" that PtE stands for comes across the best, I feel. The initial flavor is shockingly bitter with grapefruit peel melding instantly with clean, golden malt just in time for the piney and tangerine-like back. Finishes dry... really dry, actually, with a lingering oily, fruity note.    Feel is slick and palate-coating, with a tempered carbonation and medium body that belies its 8% strength. Ethanol is mildly present but not at all overabundant or intense. In my opinion, 8 to 8.5% is probably the best DIPA alcohol range, and this represents the best-of-the-best of the lower-ABV DIPAs. If you haven't had this, you're missing out. A simply amazing, balanced drink. Makes a mockery out of many lower-caliber IPAs. Worth getting by (nearly) any means possible.

Outside of Whole Foods in San Jose, you have to walk out of the store and upstairs to this great beer drinking spot. The bartender was great and we were lucky to share a couple bottles.     L: A much clearer pour than I'm used to back east  S: Mmm. Pine sweetness, matched with some tropical goodness, with a pleasant grapefruit (cut in half, sugar sprinkled, and flame torched) aroma just waiting to be enjoyed  T: Matching the nose, which by the way, is a staple of greatness. Full of magic and depth while delivering a well balanced moment worthy of sharing at your biggest occasions.   F: The mouthfeel is light for such a big taste. Lighter than expected but says volumes to this remarkable experience  O: Whenever on the West Coast I will make this a go to beer. Among the very best in world.     When one has a life mission, lives the dream, creates a moment of enjoyment to all that shares your craft, you sleep with dreams that your life's work makes a difference.

In an age where there's so much craft beer out there that it all tries to be crazy and unique, this one just hits all the marks with out trying. I tried to put myself back in time as well to when there weren't a billion IPAs on the market and yeah, this would have blown my mind. Simply put, I think this set the standard for a reason, but people are out there now successfully making beer just about as good. Not knocking this beer at all, but if you're waiting for a beer to change your entire life, that's not what Pliny is doing (in my opinion). Nice yellow color, quite a bit brighter than a lot of IPAs out there. The pine in the nose is 90% of what comes through. Mild carbonation and just a ton of hops in the aftertaste. This is good drinking, and beer as it should be.

I'd first drank this 7-8 years ago... a friend at a liquor store turned me onto this...at the time, I could buy as much as I wanted! (Think it was $4.99 then, maybe even $3.99). Even then, before I even knew what an IPA was, I found them too hoppy and bitter. However, scarcity and an open mind makes me try it when I do see it retail.    I prefer lagers, wheat beer and belgian ales...more malt than hop, so these double IPAs don't do much for me. Really too strong and powerful to enjoy, though this is more balanced and clean than many.    Had a Far Out IPA on tap the other day that I enjoyed much more...    My advice: ignore the ratings and hype and trust your own taste buds. They're the only ones that matter!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Glad to finally get to try this one, not too detailed of a review there are 'Pliny' of those on here. One of the best overall beers I've had, if you haven't tried it you need to!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Bottle dated 12-22-16 poured into a snifter about a month old.     A: a clear and very clean amber color. Around 1-2 fingers of head and tons of lacing left as it faded.     A: The pine definitely dominant with a little grapefruit and a hint of some type of spice.     T: Multiple tastes in this one. An interesting flavor to start and then the pine really shows up. As I pause in between drinks I get a little more of the grapefruit and a little spice.     F: Hops and more hops with some bitter pine rounding it out.     O: A fantastic beer with an amazing hoppy taste. Left me wanting another one or two. Definitely hit the mark and lives up to hype. I really want to try the Younger version to compare.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Looks beautiful. Classy, almost fake looking advertisement contrived head. Two, nearly three fingers of firm, fluffy solid slightly off white foam provides a confident lacing that remains consistently about an inch high in design thoroughly across the glass.    Nose provides an equal portion of malt and hops invasion that results in slight pepper, a little bubble gum, mango, muted pine and a hint of vegetable earthiness.    Taste is equally satisfying, but departs from any sweetness that was in the nose while maintaining a solid attack of pine bitterness and alcohol bite that I was missing from drinking all the New style IPAs lately. With this one I can almost taste what went on to influence so many west coast IPAs I've come to enjoy. It truly is the"Elder".

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from the classic bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip    L: Clear light to medium golden pour. 1 finger of foamy white head... falls fast with great lacing.    S: Glorious hops... pine, resin, citrus and some herbal character.    T/F: Strong but light malts, some bready flavors and a ridiculously complex and delicious bitter hop kick in the ass. Strong pine and herbal notes with lighter citrus and grapefruit. Peppercorn... slightly floral... smooth and oily on the tongue. Sticky in the aftertaste. Medium in body. Grapefruit on the aftertaste.    O: A classic and a 'whale' for a reason. Just an all-around outstanding beer, and huge thanks to DEK196 for the hookup. One to savor and enjoy... and damn do I wish this had even occasional availability on the East Coast.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 I've heard so much about Pliny over the last few years and I finally had an opportunity to have it on a trip to San Diego.    We found it on tap at Toronado (great beer bar), and I was expecting something earth shattering, but for me the hype did not live up to reality. That's not to say I don't like it, but I was expecting more.

Piney aroma and taste coupled with slight tropical dry vibrant mouthfeel leading to a crisp clean very hoppy but so concealed with flavor and very little malty tone coming in a distant 4th dimension on this. Tried them all and still my amazing. You marry this kind of beer.    You cannot get tired of this beer. It will haunt you.    For those who like a juicy hop bomb!

I'd definitely drink this again, but after tasting a lot of what the NE is pumping out in the IPA world, I'd much rather the fruitier juicier varieties. Having said that, this beer is very well balanced. Creamy, bready flavor without bitterness. I favored the Blind Pig over this one, but this is a solid DIPA.

Smells bready and doughy with loads of bright tropical fruit and citrusy notes of passionfruit, guava, mango, peach, papaya, grapefruit, orange peel, with floral earthy herbal grass and dank resinous pine. Tastes like passionfruit, guava, mango, peach, papaya, grapefruit, orange peel, some bready malts, with bitter floral earthy herbal grass and dank resinous pine. Feels medium bodied, creamy and smooth with moderate low carbonation. Overall a real great and classic DIPA.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 This is it. This is probably the beer that will turn any beer snob snob into a beer snob (apologies, not really a fan of "beer snob" as a term but it sounds quite poetic).     The thing is I only had it twice, but it still remember it vividly. Among IPAs, it is by far one of the easiest to drink. The perfect analogy is Jennifer Lawrence wearing a dominatrix costume. Its powerful, fragrant, hoppy, amazing complex but it light and unbelievably easy to drink, lulling you to a state of wanting to drink it over and over (of course, responsibly)    After drinking a huge array of IPAs, you realize that complexity and power are different things, and most IPAs confuse overly powerful flavors with complexity and general deliciousness. This is one of few that manages to pull it off    Apologies it sounds ranty, just finished a bottle :D

A creamy effervescent mouth feel, a malty bitterness with citrus mingling and that same hint of honey emerging on the finish. As it warms, more is emerging. This seems like a simple beer at first but don't be fooled. There are subltle complexities here that need to be studied. That would explain the long run Pliny has enjoyed.

There's a pine crispness and a deep woodsy undertone that carries the mouthfeel... Lingers just long enough to appreciate the complexity of the hops but not too long as to have your mouth feel caked over. I'm very impressed with this... It was on my to-do list for a long time. Cheers!
