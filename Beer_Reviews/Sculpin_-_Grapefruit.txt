look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 L-Pours a nice looking one finger headed IPA with a golden amber body. Very clear in appearance as well.   S-Nice tangy hop aroma upfront. Crisp grapefruit is also present. Aroma is very nice, but toned down quite a bit.   T-Tastes great. What can I say? A nice bitter bite develops immediately, followed by a citrusy grapefruit and sweet blood orange. Toned down and surprisingly sessionable.   F-Crisp and bubbly. Light and fresh.  O-Extremely well crafted American IPA. It isn't as memorable as I remember, no pun intended, but it was just pure quality. Crisp, refreshing, and dangerously inviting.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 I can't believe it's taken me so long to get to this IPA...    ...Well, the more I think about it I do. You see, the last BP offering I had, their cream ale, tasted like a liquid ash tray and it just turned me sour on BP ever since. It's been a few years, I was feeling the holiday spirit so I picked up this IPA as I have hear it's pretty go - and whaddaya know - it is. Great clear and effervescent coloration, decent lacing. The smell is sweet and full of grapefruit, which is what I can say about the taste - a punch of puckering grapefruit. Mouthfeel is more carbonated than I prefer but lightly bodied and crisp. This lives up to the hype and sometimes good things do come to those who wait...or procrastinate...

Strong bright grapefruit juice scent; light pine, orange, pineapple  Juicy grapefruit, honeydew, stone fruit.  Soft initial mouthfeel with pleasant bitterness developing across the tongue. Dry finish.  I find a lot of variation across the Sculpins and put this in the middle of the pack. Definitely will buy again.

Pours with a golden orange-colour and a foggy, translucent body that is capped off with one finger of loose, off white froth. It fizzles off within a couple of minutes, scattering a modest amount of lacing about as it recedes down to a soapy collar; looks fine to me. It smells mainly of pine and resiny hop oils, with a strong undercurrent of grapefruit juice. Maybe a hint of honey, orange peel and light cereal grain sweetness in there too, but it's a pretty one-dimensional aroma - though I do like grapefruit, so I'm certainly not complaining.    Delicious stuff. The grapefruit is front and center throughout the sip, buoyed at first by a subtle grainy pale malt backing that soon gives way to juicy orange and grapefruit citrus, as well as peach and apricot. A pithy bitterness asserts itself nearer the finish, becoming more resiny and earthy at its conclusion. Medium in body, with middling carbonation levels that provide a proper bite to what is actually a rather slick, persistent mouthfeel. Fantastically easy to toss back - I rationed these six bottles out over the course of two weeks, but I could've easily knocked 'em back in a night (with the right motivation).    Final Grade: 4.25, an A-. I drink a hell of a lot of IPAs. I've tried so many that it has gotten to the point where genuinely impressive ones are becoming harder to come by - and that is why experiences like Grapefruit Sculpin remain so delightful to my senses. This was priced a few bucks higher than the average (imported American) sixer in this market, but as long as they can keep a fresh supply coming I think they'll have plenty of takers in Ontario - I'll certainly be back for more, and I'd love to see more BP stuff crop up in these parts in the future.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 355 ml bottle served cold into a tulip. Purchase came out to $3 CDn per bottle, but it's not often that we get SoCal IPA's available in this neck of the woods.    Appearance - Hazy rich golden / amber colored brew. Two plus fingers of super light off-white head sit on top. Good staying power and lots of visible carbonation. Spotty lacing at the edges of the glass.    Smell - Plenty of grapefruit initially with some minerally aspects and subtle earthiness in behind. But, mostly it's grapefruit, grapefruit and more grapefruit.    Taste - Tons of grapefruit, fairly intense bitterness, lots of pith, with some leafiness. Transitions to a little sweeter mid sip with healthy malt bill and a touch of other tropical fruits, think melon and cantaloupe, but first and foremost the taste is about grapefruit. Lemon zest too at the end.    Mouthfeel - Slick and sticky, fairly heavily bodied, approaching DIPA level of this, but a fizzy body relaxes the tongue and mouth and makes this an easy beer to drink.    Overall - Certainly one of the best IPA's I've had this year and stacks up pretty damn close to it's prodigious reputation.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This is my favorite IPA so far. Tried about 15 and I'm from SD, the "IPA capital of the US" so most have been local and very highly decorated and rated. This one is NOT what I thought it would be. I actually hate that "piney" (guess some people eat pine...) and "hoppy" IPA taste. I hate grapefruit too. This is much more like what I like: Juicy orange and apricot with a HINT of grapefruit and lemon rinds. Very, very well done. I consider this world-class, minus the smell and look, which drag it down a bit.    OK, I just smelled it again. Gotta move smell up to 4.5. Smell is fantastic out of the bottle, but hard for me to smell in the glass. Very addictive and unique smell.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 L - golden with notes of orange highlights with a good amount of clarify and a medium off-white head that dissipates quickly but leaves behind a little bit of lacing.   S - piney, bitter hops along with sweet citrus up front - definitely the grapefruit. The smell is good, but not particularly prominent  T - Grapefruit up front and throughout - it's pretty prominent, but well done - alongside notes of piney, bitter hops and a malt backbone to tie it all together.   F - Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Smooth, somewhat creamy but very crisp at the same time.  O - This is another great scuplin IPA from Ballast Point with great notes of grapefruit that give this beer it's own character compared to the standard Sculpin - that said, I think this version is slightly one noted compared to the standard sculpin IPA. Great, but not as good as the original.

S: Their is no denying that there is grapefruit in this beer, that is all that you get on the initial smell. Behind the grapefruit smell there is a lot of hoppiness going on but the grapefruit takes center stage here.  T: This beer tastes exactly like you would hope it would. They say it is a grapefruit IPA and that is exactly what it is. I didn't know if I would like this beer because I absolutely hate grapefruits, but the bitterness from the grapefruit and the bitterness from the hops work together in perfect harmony to make one of my now favorite IPA's out there.  F: Dry mouthfeel like you would expect from the hops. This beer is a weird one. The grapefruit taste makes it feel like it would be refreshing but all the hops that they use in it make it dry feeling like a hop bomb is.  O: Great love this beer would and will buy this beer again my only complaint is that I did not buy it before.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Beautiful rose gold color with white cap and lacing.    Grapefruit grows on trees so it's a flowering fruit and I don't know what grapefruit flowers smell like but that's what I'm reminded of here. An aroma of bright, flowery citrus hops with a definite grapefruit hit.    Flavor is well defined among the hops in a way that is less sharp yet richer than the regular Sculpin. There is more of a malt presence than the regular Sculpin as well though not enough to compete with the hops, just support them.    Medium full texture with balancing carbonation.    Overall it seems a bigger yet more refined version of the regular Sculpin. I can't say this is just the regular with grapefruit added, it's something more, rounder, smoother (that word again) with a bigger room presence. Stream fishermen are familiar with stream bed stones that have tumbled around for thousands of years becoming rounded down and worn smooth. That's what I mean by smooth, an absence of jagged edges. This is a round stone beer that's strong enough (7%) to be pushy but isn't and hoppy enough to be brash yet it's not. A beer of substance and manners that simply sits down and joins the conversation like a genial, good humored friend.

Aroma is primarily grapefruit with some floral and earthy hops. I probably prefer this aroma slightly over the tropical regular Sculpin.    Taste is grapefruit with heavy earthy and dank hops - not exactly balanced, and the grapefruit flavor taste added rather than from a natural hop profile.    Mouthfeel is a bit heavy for a regular IPA with huge, strong, lasting bitterness. Light carbonation.    Overall, a decent IPA, right there with the regular Sculpin, but not really worth the premium price over every other available IPA. I can probably think of 20 others I would pick up first.

It's very crisp, very refreshing, very tasty. It has very little bitterness (just a little on the back end) but also isn't sweet. It also doesn't have any of the tartness of actual grapefruit - everything else here softens the impact of the grapefruit and rounds it out with a very smooth, light mouthfeel with a slight spritz of carbonation that feels like it would be perfect for a bright, sunny day. This is expertly crafted and perfectly balanced, and definitely one of the best beers I've had to date.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3 Too much Grapefruit! Sculpin should not even be mentioned. This is a Grapefruit beer, period. It is similar to Graperfruit Shandy that I had from Leinenkugels, but more expensive. This does not feel like an IPA to me. Just too much Grapefruit which takes away from what made Sculpin great in the first place. The great Sculpin taste is taken away. This is not worth the price tag and quite frankly I'd stay away from this one. Sure if you absolutely LOVE grapefruit then maybe this is for you. If you just like grapefruit but enjoy IPA more then don't get this. If you don't like IPA's well then why are you buying this, just go get Grapefruit Shandy, some fruity wheat beer.

Lots of people lick this sour bitter but one glass is enough for me. 70 IBUs

look: 3 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 Pours a cloudier version of regular sculpin, a little bit orange with plenty of that grapefruit zested skin floating throughout the beer. Aroma smacks less of the dry hopping and more of the old school grapefruit C hop bitter kick.    Taste, yeah, this obscures what made Sculpin great. Instead of being that beer that first dropped other hop flavors than grapefruit and pine, this one reverts back to a substantial amount of grapefruit that obscures everything else. Forget any notions of other jucier and more flavorful citrus or tropical fruit. The body is still relatively drinkable, but not as dry somehow. I dunno, I just file this in the long line of beers that fall under the "hoppy beer they made worse by dummying it up with fruit like adjunct."

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Hands down my favorite, readily available beer. Pours the prettiest deep, gold color of any beer. Hits all the spots that a West Coast IPA needs to hit, while the extra grapefruit makes it stand out just a little more.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 I think the regular Sculpin is overly bitter and this one, while similar and containing all the same bitterness, “freshens” it somewhat with the grapefruit addition. This seems to mellow it out. A hoppy but juicy, bright and refreshing drink.

Tastes refreshing, the grapefruit really comes through but doesn't give it any bitterness.  Feel is superb.    One of my current favorite beers.    Wish it wasn't so expensive, but when I have the money it's well worth the splurge.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 The look of this beer is s nice dark amber color with about a finger and 1/2 of head and lacing.  S: The beer smells of citrus and hops very pleasant Grapefruit to it    T: wow just a great balance of hops and citrus , phenomenal flavor of graftuit citrus and hops. Just the perfect balance of flavor and hops.     F : light carbonation. Just perfect body not heavy very drinkable west coast style IPA.     O: I can see why this IPA is so expensive at 12.99 a six pack. So very drinkable. This is absolutely an all star of west coast style IPA. I would never pass on this IPA ever. Absolutely one of my favorite IPA I have had.

Taste is red grapefruit, a tiny bit of bitterness, sweet malt flavor, and apricot. Dry, finishes very clean, smooth. Good grapefruit flavor, refreshing beer that has you coming back for more with the finish.

Fruitcake malt qualities with a decent spiciness.     M - Slight alcohol warmth and tingle, but very smooth and refreshing. Drying hops in the finish keeps me coming back for another sip. Carbonation is perfect for the style and enough to cleanse the sweetness.    O - The sweetness is good and quite balanced by hops, but for me, it might make this one less than sessionable.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This was poured into a nonic pint glass. The appearance was a nice hazy golden orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a good thirty seconds. The lacing stuck at first and then slid in a messy sort of way. The smell had a sweet and bitter grapefruit, somewhat like pulp and somewhat like rind. Extra citrus comes through nicely. The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors to combine and lead a slight spice to round out. A dry grapefruit/grassy aftertaste leads to a quick dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation pounds like a fresh AIPA and subdues my tongue into submission. Overall, this is where it’s at, great stuff!

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3.75 Bottle dated 17140 (May 20). DFH Tulip.    A: pours a beautiful orange copper with 1 finger white head. Not much visible carbonation. Little lacing, modest retention.    S: Grapefruit! Really overpowering grapefruit. Smells like the air freshener I use in my office (which is nice, but man is this strong). Maybe some bready malt behind it, but really - just grapefruit.    T: initial arrival is standard hoppy IPA, with a little backpack BH crisp crackery malt. Then the grapefruit essence builds up almost immediately into a very early and strong grapefruit mid palate. The bitterness follows very soon thereafter. The quickness of the transitions here is the big story for me. The bitterness is high and profoundly grapefruity.    M: like the regular sculpin, this is a perfect West Coast IPA texture; mid bodied with moderate carbonation and pretty highly attenuated. Very clean, but for the lingering grapefruit pith.    O: that was different. I like grapefruit. I even like grapefruit flavors in my IPAs. But this takes it to a whole other level of grapefruitiness.

Look: Pretty clear amber color, with a nice and creamy white head that leaves a decent bit of lacing.    Smell: Immediate scent of grapefruit and hops.    Taste: Grapefruit and hops immediately come through, followed by some slight malt and bready notes on the finish. All in all this beer tastes pretty much exactly as advertised and it is really good.    Mouthfeel: Medium body, creamy, with some carbonation. This is a pretty easy drinking beer.

It was the only draft IPA they had, and I was skeptical while ordering it, not being a big grapefruit fan in general. I was blown away by how tasty and drinkable this was. I couldn't really distinguish much grapefruit flavor in particular, just a general sweet fruitiness that was a perfect counterpoint to the hop bite. I'll definitely be seeking this one out in the future. Cheers!

Smell is fresh scraped grapefruit rind, bitter, pleasant, sour and enticing.     Taste is similar: bitter grapefruit rind, some malt, toast, background hops of lemon, earth, herbal.    Mouthfeel is bitter, but plays well for the style and additions    Overall, a great addition to a great beer, grapefruit is real tasting without any odd off notes.

L: Clear orange. Plenty of light amber head.    S: Soft, unique fruity IPA aroma, kinda strange though. At one point it brought to my remembrance Pink Lemonade Kool Aid, which was good. But didn't find that in each bottle throughout the sixer.    T: It's not fresh but it's still flavorful. A little yeasty, not hoppy, thinking that's due to the age.    F: Light bodied but flavorful, balanced, smooth.     O: At 8 months old it tastes weird. It had standout aroma and flavor but they just didn't suit my taste. Need to try a fresh one.

Overall this is a great IPA, a little better than regular sculpin in my opinion.

Plenty of lacing left down the glass. Looks great    Smell- They were serious when they named it Grapefruit Sculpin. Also some other citrus notes and other fruits in the mix.     Taste- The citrus comes through the most. A great hop mix to go with the citrus notes. A clean super fresh taste.     Mouthfeel- A carbonation and fruity aftertaste    Overall- A great IPA that is so drinkable.

S-Aroma starts with standard IPA profile, not too much grapefruit up front.  T-Taste hits the same notes, grapefruit very very muted. Some maltiness.  M-Medium bodied and carbonation and some hop slickness.   O-Overall I just didn't love this beer, the grapefruit addition didn't do much for me. Maybe it would have if I could pick it up... It's a good IPA on it's own, but not a standout grapefruit variant. Not worth the $2.50 for a bottle, but perfectly drinkable

Pours a clear, pale, golden orange with two fingers of cream colored, frothy head with good lacing. Decent nose primarily of grapefruit and citrus hops with underlying pine notes. Fairly juicy it starts and finisnes with bitter grapefruit with a hint of base malts in the middle. Mouth feel is light medium with good carbonation.    A great west coast IPA and a solid choice.

Taste is super dry hoppy goodness, with warm temps hitting AZ this is just a nice beer for a warm day. Lots of hops and that grapefruit bite make this a good outside beer. The finish is light carbonation with dryness, just a well done IPA.

Holds the head for a couple minutes and left some sticky lacing on the glass. Beautiful burnt orange color that glows when held in the light. When they say grapefruit...holy smokes is it grapefruit! This beer smells like a fresh, sliced grapefruit with a passionfruit compliment (not just a hint), followed by the dank hop that the regular Sculpin is known for. The smaller the sip, the bigger the grapefruit I find, this beer should be slowly sipped for maximum flavor. Grapefruit, passion fruit, nice balance of citrus and hops, perfect amount of carbonation. Feels a bit on the thin side but if you're drinking a grapefruit you want it be thin. VERY impressed with this one. Will absolutely grab a sixer of this next time I see it.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Bottle Date: presumably this year  Palate Contaminants: none    Okay, I'm giving the sculpins one more chance.    Appearance is a good medium-dark amber that's mostly clear. Plenty of fine head that leaves good lacing.    The smell is nice and malty, and it's a hearty kind of maltiness. Marmalade, watermelon, marshmallow, and a slight bit of white grapefruit. I like it. Sweet, but not overboard on it.    The taste isn't overly sweet. It's mostly watermelon up front with bitter grapefruit on the back end. It also reminds me of arugula. It's very vegetal, but not particularly complex.    The feel is medium thickness with fine carbonation.    Okay, I'm back on good terms with Ballast Point.

A foamy and bubbly creamy, beige with an orange hue, 2-3 finger head, lasting around 10 minutes, with pretty good legs, nice lace and swirl effect. Flavors of soft butter and caramel, grapefruits, tangerines, passion fruits, sweet grains, lemon, wild yeast, herbal spices. Tender tropical fruit sweetness with sharp bitter hops. Slick and smooth medium body with extra crispy carbonation. Medium to strong strength finish, slightly dry and clovey, a bit piney and grassy but dominantly fruity, with zesty citrusy hops, some hay and funky yeast. Quite delicious with a high quality fruity feel, almost like raw juice. Great balance and very well intensified, complex and rich. Highly fresh and drinkable. Almost like California in my mouth. Overall superb quality craft.

F: medium, carbonated, slightly fizzy.  T: grapefruit overpowers the hops. Mainly grapefruit taste followed by citrus hops with sourness caused by grapefruit.  O: i have yet to have regular sculpin but as far as grapefruit IPA it just doesn't do it for me. Sometimes you get grapefruit in IPA beers that is delivered by hops which was what I had high hopes for, but this is like mildly hoppy beer with addition of grapefruit and it just doesn't do it for me. I understand grapefruit is the main feature in this beer but it actually ruins the beer instead of enhancing it.

Swallow is more juicy grapefruit and pithy hops with some lingering sweetness.

Great flavors and complexity with the grapefruit really bringing all the citrus to the forefront. Definitely one to grab if you see it.

Nice sourness but I think that's just a feature of regular sculpin. Honestly doesn't taste too much different, but a bit more bitter which makes it worse rather than better.  Feel: Nice grapefruit aftertaste dominates the palate, but the downside of having over-the-top grapefruit is bitterness. Leaves the mouth a little too bitter and a little too sticky too.  Overall: a little bit unbalanced because because of the bitterness and sticky feel. Otherwise, great solid west coast IPA though there are a lot of things out there that are much cheaper and the same quality.    (1/6/2017) Going back to this after having regular sculpin, I don't think the grapefruit does anything to enhance this beer, except in the nose. It doesn't really affect the taste and kind of takes away from the finish by making it a bit more bitter. Overall it's less balanced and not quite as great.

It comes with deep amber hue and likely clear body with ton of white frothy head and excellent strength of retention, it slowly dissipates to a thin eternal foamy crown and leaves very good sticky lacing along the way.    The aromas of orange candy, juicy and fresh grapefruit, herbal, malty biscuit, and vanilla. It is so aromatic and very orange candy-like with some tart of grapefruit.    The palate gets rich grapefruit, lemon, resin, and candy-like caramel malt. The bitterness is there at the finish, nicely balance by overall.    Medium body with smooth mouthfeel, the carbonation is moderate with some crisp and lively touch through the palate, dry finish.    Great IPA indeed, the grapefruit addition makes the character much sharper, fruity, and intense comparing to the original.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured from 12oz bottle without bottle/freshness date into standard pint glass.     L: Honey Amber with solid finger width white head with excellent retention.     S: Heavy on the citrus aroma here, not only citrus hops but also a welcome twist of Tangerine, Orange and of course Grapefruit.     T: I came into this with an open mind, knowing that the regular Sculpin was already excellent but boy is this take on the original just a delight. It keeps the citrus, grassy and floral hops and adds the extra tartness of Grapefruit and Tangerine with the same sweet biscuity balancer in the back. Super refreshing and crisp the finish on this extra just dry enough to make you want to drink more.     F: Light-Medium body, crisp on the tongue and just a slightly dry finish.     O: Better than the original and one of the best IPAs you can buy.

A: Pours a very clear gold, with average visible carbonation and a two finger white head that has great retention. A very pretty beer.    S: Grapefruit – pink and sweet. Light cracker malts. Simple but nice - big grapefruit for sure.    T: Ruby red grapefruit juice with a touch of bitter rind. Pale cracker malts. Finishes with more pulpy grapefruit juice flavor. Remains relatively lightly bitter for an IPA - about the bitterness of unsweetened grapefruit juice.    M: Light body, carbonation sensation on the low side, and the alcohol is quite well-hidden.    O: I thought this was a really tasty beer...but you gotta like grapefruit and grapefruit juice to get into this one. There isn't much else going on here.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I bought a bottle of this off the single shelf at the local Meijer. It poured a clear copper with white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent is grapefruit. The taste is bitter leaning but easy to drink. There was grapefruit present throughout. The Mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it's a solid beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 355ml bottle into a Spiegleau IPA glass. Paid £5.10 for a single.    Pours a bright, translucent, golden-orange body with a small amount of sluggish carbonation visible. A light, bubbly, two-finger in height, bone-white head, slowly fades to a thin film and collar, leaving behind a decent covering of spotty lace.    The zesty, hop-forward nose predominantly consists of semi-sweet juicy citrus. Fleshy grapefruit, orange and tangerine lead above lesser notes of light-skinned stone fruit, while floral and pine aromas become perceptible towards the back end. Taste roughly follows suit. Bold, juicy, sweet grapefruit undoubtedly leads, but its presence is not as dominant as the name might suggest. Plenty of orange and tangerine follow shortly after, along with faint traces of tart apricot, peach and nectarine. Hints of caramel, honeyed pale malt and a light bready sweetness reveal the beers subtle backbone, combining with citrus to create a marmalade-like profile throughout the lengthy mid palate. Bitterness begins to build towards the back end. Oily grapefruit peels, pine and floral hop profiles mark a change from the initially juicy and sweeter start. In the mouth a light to medium body paired with assertive but not aggressive carbonation feels smooth and crisp from start finish. On the very end, bitter, pithy citrus and resinous pine linger just long enough to balance any residual fruit and malt sweetness, drying the palate and finishing quick and clean.    Overall this is an excellent beer. Bright, juicy and incredibly well balanced, it captures a punchy, authentic grapefruit character that perfectly complements the regular Sculpin underneath. Crisp and refreshing, alcohol is completely undetectable, drinking dangerously below the 7% ABV. It took some effort and expense to acquire my bottles in the UK. If I had regular access to fresh, reasonably priced six-packs, I would definitely add this to my list of year-round fridge staples. Recommended.

Aside from obvious grapefruit, the smell immediately recalls those delightful little orange jelly packets with pieces of clementine. On the tongue, this is balanced by some hay and rich, biscuit malt. A little too bitter on the finish for me - the palette is overwhelmed with fruit rind on swallowing.    The carbonation begins quite high, but eventually relaxes into medium body and mild warmth on the breath. Very pleasant - would be curious to try on tap.

GLASSWARE: Howard's Pub pint... a robust orange amber body raises confident bubbles at a constant rate... the two-finger head is thick, white, and lacing like a picket fence of cloud cover... yes, the grapefruit is the soup du jour, but a refreshing sense of lemon, an earthiness and flowery uplift that is winning... sweetness comes in an undercurrent of bread malts... mouth feel is incredibly sessionable, medium-bodied, active at the teeth but balanced enough... the aftertaste is ebullient, with plenty of staying power... flavor profile includes the aforementioned grapefruit, with lemon, orange, bread, and earthy hops... the much lauded Sculpin is given a fruity, Pacific island kind of feel, with enough strength to create a buzz after only a few... does not disappoint...

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 A 355ml bottle brought in Whole Foods while in NYC.  Pours a bright golden orange colour with a small foamy white head which leaves lacing. Moderate carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, orange peel, citrus, tropical fruits, sweet candy, grass and dry hay. A comforting malty citrus backbone is present throughout with an initial taste of grapefruit, orange, and lemon, finishing with a hoppy grapefruit flavour that lingers, but does not dominate. Medium sweet aftertaste with a malty grapefruit medium hopped bitter finish. Overall a very good fruity AIPA.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Way too over priced for what it tastes like. It smells good. Its slightly hoppy, bummer, and not as grapefruity as I expected. Kinda normal beer/ipa mix taste to it. A tiny bit burnt out bitter, like a previous reviewer stated. It may just have been a bad batch due to merchandising negligence.(And because hardly anyone buys the things. I live in Vegas by the way) It does have a great orangey burp. Overall not great at all. Sorry guys at Ballast. I'm truelly not a picky snobby prick but your selling a Maybach and giving an Acura. Good but only 6.99 a six good. Not 16$ a six.    All my tasting is done first in bottle(a sip after having wiped off the mouth piece, because major metallic flavors come from the cap) and afterwards in them Sahm made in Germany glasses.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Serving: Can  Canned: Jul-27-2016    This is a tasty, easy drinking summery beer. Perfect for a swimming pool or camping. I am usually not much for fruit in beers, but this and other similar beers are making me re-evaluate that stance as the fruit adds complexity rather that sweetness/juicyness. It still takes center-stage in my opinion, but at least it is a little subdued. The fruit is definitely there, but it blends well enough with the hops that it just adds a crisp, fruity layer. Citrusy, pine-spicy hops with an oily grapefruit aromatic character that makes it a little fresher than regular Sculpin. Both the flavor and aroma have a hearty biscuit character that was nice, but I think mainly due to the age of the can. As it warmed the sweetness of the juice (or pulp or whatever) came out more, which wasn't my favorite combined with the malt. Regardless, I would imagine that with hops that popped a touch more this would something even more special. Crystal clear copper, soapy head, very drinkable, refreshing. I would have this one again, but I definitely still prefer regular Sculpin.

For a real treat get it fresh from the brewery in San Diego.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pour is a clear golden orange hue. Settles quickly to a ring of head with excellent lacing. Aroma is grapefruit just as expected, with a few doses of pinneapple and mango as well. Somewhat grassy and piney compliment the real rich citrus smell. Taste follows the nose well, dominant grapefruit. Hoppy bitterness and a sweet malt profile in the back end. Not detecting any other tropical flavors except for grapefruit, which is fine with me. Mouthfeel is relatively thin bodied, moderate carbonation. Solid IPA, not quite as excellent as Sculpin, but the grapefruit title follows the taste and aroma very well.

What a tremendous beer! I subsequently bought a six pack, rather costly I might add and was somewhat dissapointed. All characteristics: color, appearance, foam, scent, etc. were essentially the same. However the taste was not. I preferred the on tap version as it revealed the balance of the grapefruit's acidity, sweetness, and bitterness all at once in a much more rapid manner. I thought perhaps it was because the tap version was slightly warmer when poured. So, I let the bottled version warm slightly but it still did not compare as well to that of the tap. I'm. Not disparaging this product at just stating a preference.

A distributor problem,  I didn't think highly of the beer.    I bought a few cans of the Grapefruit Sculpin in Trader Joes. The BD is less than a month.    Okay- BIG difference.    I chose a Stone IPA glass which is similar to the glass Ballast Point uses in its pic.  It's interesting to note that if one searches images for a beer on Google, then click on a certain glass,  the review can help to decide which glass to choose. The DFH IPA glass got a so-so review. The Stone style IPA glass review was excellent.    Great pour. 3F head. Clear cider like color. Carbonation bubbles.    The aroma wasn't strong at first. Earthy, light citrus. Then, with warming, the flavors developed.  Rich citrus, grapefruit, sweet. It's unusual that an IPA aroma would develop so well with warming.    The taste is outstanding. The most balanced citrus taste in an IPA I can recall. Very complex.  Grapefruit, grapefruit rind. citrus, sweet, and tropical fruit.    Excellent finish- tingling, hoppy, and citrus.    I'm a convert. I didn't like the regular Sculpin in the past. BD's rule. Exceptional balance in flavor and palate,  I need to buy some more.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 12 oz can into a standard pint glass. Pours a golden amber color with lots of visible carbonation. Nose is grassy with lots of grapefruit. Taste is floral and fruity on the front, with a resiny but not overwhelming hop finish. Grapefruit is present but not excessively sweet. There is a lingering sweetness of melon/honey, most likely from the malts, though the beer could use a bolder malt profile IMO. Mouthfeel is crisp with vigorous though not strident carbonation. By the end, the hops have completely overpowered the fruit, and it tastes more like its resinous father, the original Sculpin.    I like this a lot as a fruit-centered east coast IPA. It is easy to drink and has a moderate alcohol content. The only thing that would prevent me from buying this again is the price ($18 for a 6-pack). Other beers in this style are much more accessible, cheaper, and brewed locally.

I think there's other beer that's just as good or better for less from little guy breweries that you won't find at every grocery store in the United States. Now that this is being produced by the same company that produces Corona, and the supply is virtually endless, the price should not be this high. How many years has that been said about Starbucks?... It is what it is.  Like many Starbucks beverages, this does not disappoint the mouth, only the wallet.   IPA's often suffer from a bitter, lingering, grapefruit pith bitterness. As the off flavors of a Chardonnay are transformed when drank along side a buttery dish, the grapefruit tames and enhances what was already a good IPA--Sculpin.

My first grapefruit IPA and don't think I've tasted any other IPA besides Stone Enjoy By Tangerine that labels as a specific fruit. Very tasty and refreshing on a summer day.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.25 For the price I paid for this IPA ($13), I would have been better off with the local Michigan IPA I was originally going to get (Short's Freedom of '78; collab beer). This beer I thought was very good, but 95?? 99?? No way! Too light and fruity for an American IPA. For the price, I will never buy this beer again. If I'm paying that kinda money for an IPA it better have more balls than this beer has! Good, but not great; especially for the money I paid here in Michigan. And if you're throwing fruit into a beer, you're probably not putting in enough hops to let them do the talking for themselves!

I went into a local tavern about a year or so ago and they had it on tap and recommended it. The folks seemed like knowledgable persons, so I gave it a whirl. Note, I'm not usually one for beer with anything added (Rheinheitsgebot and all that). I hate it when Americans insist on applying a lemon to my Hefeweizen... Anyway, it was a hot afternoon and I went to the outside seating area to try it out. Wham! The perfect beer for me at that time and place and weather. Nice.    I like everything about this beer... nice nose (even if a bit intensely grapefruitish), excellent look and feel and a great balanced flavor.    Caveat - Not a brew I would drink a ton of, especially at 7% and at the price they are now charging. But, in the right place and the right context it's hard to beat for my palate at least.    Highly recommended.

Surprising that the grapefruit aroma doesn't dominate the profile the way pineapple does in the pineapple version of this beer.     Taste is heavy on citrus fruit. Not crazy heavy on the grapefruit. Plenty of hops to add bitterness.     Feel is light crisp and clean. Really easy drinking and super refreshing. High drinkability on this one.

Smell: 3.75  Slight off aroma and quite funky. A bit malty and hop-citrusy.    Taste: 4.00  Not super bitter, but a bitterness is present. It kicks right into a pine and citrus blast. It starts to get pretty fruity and tastes like they dumped a few hundred boxes of Fruity Pebbles into the mash. There is quite a combination of flavors all mixed together. The bitterness/acidity backs off and the fruit flavors fade, and then you are left with some malt and bread.    Feel: 4  Feels a bit thin / light bodied. Was hoping for a bit more body. It flattens out quite a bit as you go.     Overall: 4  This is a decent brew. I bought as a single and not sure that I would have enjoyed a full 6 pack or not. It is an okay occasional beer, but not as a regular go to beer. It is unique though and interesting. More caramel and malt flavors would have been a bit better, and also would have liked more carbonation and body. But a good beer otherwise.

There are plenty of reviews on here that capture its essence so I'll just say that it has extraordinary depth that regular Sculpin somehow lacks and is one of the most refreshing summer beers I've tried. Outstanding.

Smells of grapefuit and bubblegum.   Tastes of grapefruit, sugar, and grain. Very smooth and fruity too. Caramel undertones are noticed.  Light to medium and the fine flow is where this one strikes gold.     Great hype, good beer, I'll have another.

This has the scent of its name w/ that piney grapefruit taste hitting the buds and a rocking nice bitter aftertaste. I happened to pick this up on sale @ Binny's Chicago so I figured I'd finally try it. Very nice and enjoyable IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 The beer is ready to go in the yellow / red color. The foam is white with small bubbles. The foam disappears leisurely quickly and leave fine traces. Aromas of grapefruit, jasmine, hops, flowers. A little citrus and orange. Tall in the background, slightly malty. Taste of a hop bomb decreases of grapefruit that is growing up. Some citrus and orange blossom, jasmine, flowers. Malty sweetness, bitterness will humlig at the end as it should. Plump body, with associated bitterness and bitterness at the end. Medium carbonation. The beer turns into a fruit bomb with grapefruit in the main event.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a can into my favorite tulip glass.    Appearance: much the same as the original sculpin, I won't expound too much here. A good amber, a tinge of orange. Mild haze, bright color overall. Good carbonation. Creamy head that lasts through about half a glass (takes me about fifteen minutes to let the beer warm and then drink a 12 oz glass). Good lacing.     Smell: the grapefruit really compounds the crisp, astringent, and citrus smells of the hops. The grassy/herbal notes are still there. Grapefruit does not dominate like you might think it would, it's about half and half with grapefruit and hops. A little bit sweeter smelling than regular Scuplin. Maybe they added just a little bit extra malt to cut the acidity of the grapefruits.     Taste: like a nice glass of Ruby Red at the very beginning but mellows to include the hops and malt. Hops are still citrusy and light, but mostly citrus comes through, which is a flavor in hops that I like anyway (Deschutes Fresh Squeezed, anyone?). A little bit sweet; I can't tell if it's from the sugar in the fruit or the extra malt, or both. Sugar only cuts the acidity, it's not cloying. I get a small flavor of artisan bread as the beer matures on the tongue.     Mouthfeel: more astringent than original Sculpin. I wouldn't exactly call it a dry feeling, but it does suck up a little bit of moisture on the tongue. Nice to meet you again, tannins. Kind of sticky, but not bad. About a medium body overall. I could session this but probably shouldn't.     Overall: I liked this more than the original Sculpin. It's not earth-shattering, but this tastes really nice and kind of helped break me out of the hop doldrums in which I had previously found myself. I don't know if it's only the grapefruit, but it feels like whatever tweaks they made to the recipe paid off. This is a very nice variation on the Sculpin and could compete with a lot of IPAs out there. In other words, it's good.    To good health and good beer.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Appearance: Pours a clean amber, with a nice near-white head of suds and a thick wall of lace.    Aroma: Yummy tropical and citrus hops, like a sunny tropical day. Very impressive.    Taste: Brilliant grapefruit — bitterness and sour and faithful in all regards. Alongside the Schlafly Grapefruit IPA, this is a wonderful and fitting fruit-accented IPA. Well-done!   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.5 Pours a hazy reddish bronze with a finger of white head. Smells of grapefruit right away followed by lemon and tangerine with a little pine. First taste is a bit of a shock because it is just like fresh squeezed grape fruit juice mixed with classic sculpin followed by a piney bitter and sweet malt with a lingering taste of mango and orange zest. Mouth feel is well carbonated and is refreshing and crisp and has a dry finish. Overall it is really great and highly drinkable I could throw these back at a bar all night long and I can't say that with a lot of other ipa style beers. Grapefruit and tropical hops work perfectly and man they killed the grapefruit flavor. Well done.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 I picked up a bottle of Grapefruit Sculpin for $2.49 at The Lager Mill. I've been wanting to try this one for a while, so lets see how it goes. 2015 Vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a imperial pint glass.    A- The label looks good, it's just as eye catching as the original. It poured a golden orange color which took on more of an orange color when held to the light with a little over half a fingers worth of bubbly off white head that died down to a thing ring that stayed till the end and it didn't leave much lacing behind. This is a pretty nice looking beer, but I wish it had better lacing.    S- The aroma starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness with the grapefruit being the first to show up and it imparts some nice juicy and natural grapefruit aroma. Up next comes the hops which impart all those nice tropical fruit, citrus rind hop profile that the original has, but there's a little bit of green hops that show up in the background. Up next comes just a little bit of doughy yeast followed by the malts which just impart a light pale malt and a light sweet malt like aroma. This beer has a very nice aroma, I thought that the grapefruit works very well with the hop profile.     T- The taste seems to be similar to the aroma and it starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness with the grapefruit still being the first to show up and it shows up as much as did in the aroma and it imparts that juicy and natural grapefruit aspects. Up next comes the hops which impart the same great hop profile, but this time the green hops seems to stick out a little more and it's followed by a slightly higher amount of medium bitterness with some malts showing up towards the ends and they impart a little big of a bready flavor with some doughy yeast showing up in the background. In the aftertaste there's a little bit of lingers bitterness with a nice hoppy and grapefruit like aftertaste. This is a very nice tasting beer, all the flavors work really well together.     M- Smooth, refreshing, crisp. medium bodied with a slightly higher amount of medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is very nice and it works great with this beer.     Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and I thought it was a great example of the a fruited IPA, the grapefruit worked great with the base beer and they came together to make for a very nice tasting beer. This beer has good drinkability, I could drink a couple of these, especially when it's hot out. What I like the most about this beer is how great the grapefruit worked with the base beer, they are the perfect combo. What I like the least about this beer is the appearance, it's not bad, but I wish it had better lacing. I would for sure buy this beer again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes grapefruit beers. All in all I was very happy with this one and a little impressed. It's one of the better beer I've had from this brewery and it's a great example of the style. Great job guys, this is one very nice tasting beer, keep it up.

Pours a gold medal color with medium head but thick, adhesive lace. Nose has the promised grapefruit, grassy hops, and other assorted fruit flavors.    A little high in carbonation and balanced to start, followed by plenty of fruit and a long bitter aftertaste. I get lemon and peach to pace the serious grapefruit. A little astringent in the finish but still tasty.     This is really good but still maybe a touch overrated.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Pours a golden amber color, mostly translucent, with a frothy white head that leaves tons of lacing. Smells like grapefruit (duh). Some other citrusy smells and tastes come through: grapefruit juice and rind, lemon, orange rind, etc. Also getting some alcohol taste that adds a medicinal/chemical flavor that I've found all variants of Sculpin to have. Luckily, this one is so bitter with grapefruity goodness that it kind of drowns out that flavor that I normally don't like about regular Sculpin. As usual with all Sculpin types, I think this beer is slightly too bitter and lacking in a malt backbone, but I kind of enjoyed BP playing up the bitterness of this beer by adding grapefruit to it. Feels about medium, and leaves a sticky, lingering, bitter finish. Overall, this is a better than average IPA, but the price point (nearly $20 a 6 pack here in PA) keeps me from being a return customer. I think you can do better for much, much cheaper, but it's worth a try anyway.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured into Spiegelau IPA glass, clear amber glow with a fluffy head that lasts for days.    What a sniffer! Grapefruit and crushed wheat on the nose, freshness that exudes a crisp summer day.    Immediate rush of grapefruit and mild yuzu on the tastebuds, tempered by the growing bitters from  citrusy hops. Lovely body that coats the palate, with bubbles that gently effervesce. Well balanced, eminently drinkable.

May have to try others from Ballast Point.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pint on draft at Loco Coco's in Kittery, Maine.    Appearance: Super clear copper color with a short white head. Rings of white lacing left behind.    Aroma: Grapefruit. Smells like an IPA with a big grapefruit punch. Also pine and hops.    Taste: Big, juicy fruit flavors up front, led by (of course) grapefruit. Some nice malt backbone, too. Really tasty. Very smooth at 7 ABV and big hop presence.    Mouthful: Deceptively smooth and easy for a beer with fairly heavy bitterness. Balanced.    Overall: Understandably beloved A-list IPA. Curious how much "grapefruitier" it is than original Sculpin. Grapefruit is a pretty common IPA flavor, but here it's in the spotlight.

Smell: My first thought was peaches, but as the pour relaxed, the grapefruit   comes powering thru. Very neat.    Taste: Perhaps a whisper of orangey sweetness, but the grapefruit presents  almost immediately and rides thru to the close, which is bitter and lingering.  (Even minutes later!) Fairly surprising punch to this, given the 7%, although   the booze didn't overly present in the taste.    Feel: Perhaps a bit astringent, otherwise, middle-of the road non-descript.    Overall: The glass presentation and nose aside--which were exceptional--  this comes up short for me. Just too much unrelenting bitterness from  the hops and accompanying grapefruit, without enough push-back from   the malt-side.

Huge grapefruit nose that definitely leans towards the hoppy citrus side but I can't help but feel it is a contrived thing going on. Did they just squirt grapefruit juice in each and every bottle? They couldn't have; I get that.     As contrived as I thought the smell was, I feel the exact same way aboot the taste. Beneath the what I feel is pure grapefruit juice, I do get the base IPA, but even that is not up to snuff anymore after all of the great IPAs I have had since then. The juice leaves me trembling. That's me.    Great mouthfeel.     Not for me but like I said. ..that's me. You like? Good for you!

The head is a gorgeous finger and a half of bright white. Good retention with s foamy top.    Most West Coast IPAs don't need grapefruit added for the scent to come out, so this comes with an amazing display of grapefruit in the nose. A little peach and mango hiding in the background.    It tastes like a grapefruit fell into a glass of IPA, and that's basically what happened. You can't tell where the hops stop and the grapefruit starts. It tastes better and better as it warms.    The initial feel of sweet is quickly taken over by acid and bitter and it never really lets up. It's not palate busting bitter, just crisp, sharp bitterness. Very refreshing. Dry prickly finish.     So easy to drink and despite being sort of a warm weather beer, this thing would be good regardless of the season.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pours the same translucent gold with just a bit of haze as regular Sculpin but slightly lighter in color. Smell is definitely grapefruit forward with some hops in the background. Taste is a big splash of grapefruit that has some of the properties of hops entangled in it but somewhat overpowers them as the grapefruit is in the spotlight. They did a great job of nailing the super fresh grapefruit taste. Feel is close to perfect and makes for a smooth swig with a burst of fizzy micro-bubbles on the tongue that adds even more life to this brew. I prefer the regular Sculpin by just a bit as the grapefruit is so forward in this one but on a hot summer day I can see this being a very refreshing choice.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Look golden with some orangish hues. Thick, fluffy head is khaki and leaves spotty lacing all over the glass.     Smell is pure grapefruit. Can't really get past that, but it's nice and refreshing so no problem there.     Taste is dominated by grapefruit, but certainly can pick up some lighter citrus notes. Not much maltiness to speak of, but the bitterness is surprisingly tame.     Feel is light with decent carbonation, chewy mouthfeel and a clean finish that's mostly bitter but holds the tartness of the grapefruit.     Not sure what else I can add. This is world class, and if something has changed since their acquisition I don't see it, and it's not gonna stop me from trying more BP in the future.

I'm not big on fruit flavor in my beer, let alone grapefruit, but this is a clear exception to that rule. I never would have even tried it if it weren't for a cute bartender that raved about it and I declined for my first coupe pours. Then she put a sample size in front of me and basically dared me to try it. I did and then had a couple of those and the hook was in my mouth and I was being pulled in. This one I prefer on tap, but bottled it's probably still my favorite Sculpin flavor.     "This is a fantastic beer. I tried this on tap last year and I have been hooked ever since. I'm trying to get to all the flavors of Sculpin. There are a bunch. This beer is so good that that you don't want to put it down and you end up drinking fairly fast. Then it's on to number 2, be careful this second one could sneak up on ya and bite ya in the @$$. It's potent! A 6 pack has put me down for the count. In a happy as a pig in slop kind of way. Can't wait to get down south to one of their breweries. If you see it in the store do yourself a favor and try it. It is pricey, especially for 6-pack, but well worth it."

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from can into a pint glass    Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a decent sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass    Smell – The aroma of the beer is big of a grapefruit hop smell as one may expect from a grapefruit brewed brew. Along with these aromas comes the normal Sculpin aromas of tropical fruits, some caramel, and a bit of pine. Really the same as the original, but with a enhanced grapefruit smell.    Taste – The taste begins very similar to the original with sweet flavor of tangerine and tropical fruits mixed with a cracker and biscuit flavor. Some rather decent grapefruit hop tastes are also present upfront, giving a bit of a departure from the original. As the taste moves on the grapefruit hop gets even strong, dominating the hop tastes of the brew. All the while the sweetness fades a bit and some lighter grassy and pine tastes join the profile. In the end, one is left with a rather heavy grapefruit but slightly drier malty and nicely hopped taste to linger on the tongue.    Mouthfeel – Both the body and the thickness of the brew are average. For the mix of cracker, grapefruit, tropics, and danker hop the medium nature of the body is nice and creates a good compromising medium for all the flavors.    Overall – This is a very good brew I must say. While I think I like the original a bit more, this is overall a very tasty and enjoyable brew.

A: Pours a clear orange-yellow with 1/4 inch white head that slowly settles to a thin skim.  S: Wonderful grapefruit, soft citrus (orange and lemon), and some spice (white pepper).  T: Grapefruit, mango, orange, and lemon zest...a wonderful amalgamation. Hint of dry cracker malt. Not overly aggressive with the hops...great taste and aroma and yet still presented as soft and fruity.  M: Softly sweet with some tang. Slightly oily feel. Light-medium body. Moderately dry with fairly mild bitterness throughout. Nice lingering on the palate too.  D: The grapefruit really goes well with the base IPA. Very refreshing and substantive. Nice complexity and great balance. Excellent summer session beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a can Julian dated the 18th of February maybe? 16048. Anyway, big bubbly foamy head atop a gold, medium carbonated beer. Lots of slow rising bubbles. Smell is straight grapefruit, maybe a few other undertones like mango or peach. Fades to more of a citrus as the beer warms. Taste is more reminiscient of the latter, with some orange in the initial sip giving way to a more complex tropical tone, washed down by more bright citrus. Ultimately better than the normal Sculpin counterpart IMO. These seem to hold up better, maybe it's the cans or because I stored the Sculpin bottles on their side a day or two, but very nice improvement to an already great beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Wow, this is honestly an amazing beer. If you have had the Sam Adams Rebel Grapefruit, and enjoyed it, you must try this. It is like that beer, 10x better in every aspect. It is perfectly carbonated, and feels like a soft drink in your mouth, with the full body of the sculpin IPAs. I am amazed by this beer, the grapefruit comes in so well and it is just so easily drinkable. Expensive, at around 13-14 USD/6 pack, it is worth it if you enjoy citrusy IPAs, or just good IPAs in general.

"Grapefruit Sculpin"  on tap @ The Boathouse, Conshohocken, PA    I find the addition of grapefruit interesting, and I know I'm in the minority on this, but I don't think it improves the beer, and actually throws off the balance a bit. What I do like is that it gives it an interesting twist, but overall I'd go for the straight Sculpin 99% of the time. Still, it's a nice option to have, and for the right occasion I'd certainly opt for this given its tart and juicy refreshment factor.

Overall: I really enjoyed this beer and would definitely recommend to others who enjoy fruity flavors for a change.
