The beer pours bright light honey colored amber with off white head. The head recedes to a thin film and ring leaving a few spots of lacing. The aroma is faint with pine and citrus. The taste is subtle caramel up front with big bitterness coming on quick. More vague citrus and pine are interwoven the final third of the taste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. There is a little residual sugar and hop oil stickiness, but the sum of the parts is enjoyable. Overall, very good classic West Coast IPA.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours copper with a finger of white foam that retains well. Aroma is orange and clementine, pine, dank, resin and syrup. Toasty biscuits, and light earthy malts round out the aroma. Hops really jump out, and hit old-school, classic notes in a beautiful way. Flavor profile is dank, resin, fir and orange citrus hops with biscuity, earthy malts behind. It carries a light bitterness and bite, but is just enough to add a little bark, not bite, to the flavor profile. Mouth feel is crisp, with a light effervescence across the tongue. It has a medium thickness. Overall, an old school, classic IPA hitting evergreen forest hop notes mixed and mingled with California resin-y. It features a light bite, but an overall soothing taste.     Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz can.

Aroma of flowery hops, citrus, stone fruit... peach or apricot? Taste is citrusy hops, a little sweet malt for balance, more citrusy hops. Excellent IPA.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 This IPA pours just about perfectly clear with just a slight haze. Rich gold in color. It poured with a white head roughly 2 fingers deep, but that dissipated rather quickly. The smell wasn't as prominent as some ipa's (though it could ust be due to allergy season). There was a very faint earthy-citrus aroma with hints of ripe melon. But the taste; Oh wow. It has a slight carbonation punch, followed by sweet malts washing over the tongue and finishes with a bitter kick to send you on your way. The bitterness is just pretty moderate though. It comes and goes, it doesn't linger on the palate like with many IPAs. Overall, a very solid beer, and one that I can see myself coming back to time and time again.

I doubt a UK brewery would produce an IPA this delicious. 1st taste was pure cream. Malt-forward, but sufficient hop bitterness to smooth everything out and not leave either a syrupy sweet or over-the-top bitter aftertaste. If you have read my other reviews, you know I loathe citrus-forward IPAs. This has hints of citrus but this is by no means "tropical" or "fruity" IPA ( thank God). It is well balanced in the hop profile with some nice spice and pine coming in alongside the citrus. At 7% alcohol, it is at my ideal percentage for an IPA. Well done, Firestone. Thank you for such a deliciois, creamy, drinkabke brew!

The flavor is the gorgeous, West Coast IPA Style, with just the right amount of piney taste and good bitter hop flavor. Sets on the palate well & finishes well. Overall, a WELL above average IPA, probably one of the top seven or eight IPA's I have had.

Quite nice	  T — Starts juicy with oranges, guava, peach, even a touch of pineapple. Then a wave of piney, earthen bitterness rushes in to balance things out. Caramel and honey-bread sweetness throughout	  F — Some fluffiness. Medium mouthfeel, medium+ carb. Flies off the palate a little quick, which makes the end of the sip feel a little watery. Good amount of lasting bitterness on the finish	  O — Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this one.

Tropical with oranges and mango notes.   The taste is the sharp pine with some of the juicy tropical notes. Has a balanced malt backbone.   The feeling is wet and a juicy type sticky.   Overall, I've not been let down by Firestone Walker yet. I'll keep buying their brews.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Had it on tap in a shaker pint. Golden yellow color with a nice white head and lacing. A somewhat floral smell. Taste is piney with a bite of grapefruit. A pleasant bitterness.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Rich thick head, smooth creamy feel. Tastes a bit like a double IPA. A little light in aroma. A very good beer. You have to try this one! 
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 My local liquor store owner talked me into trying this out and I am glad I did! This is right up there with Bell's 2 Hearted Ale, but about 3 bucks cheaper. Nice and hoppy yet not too bitter. I'm surprised I can get this from CA to here in IN. It's also fresh...only a little over 2 weeks old. I WILL get this again.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Not that much of a convincing aroma coming from this West Coast IPA. The sip tastes like an IPA through and through, but gives way to a watery aftertaste. Not my favorite IPA, could have more flavor, but not a bad beer overall.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Firestone Walker Brewing Co. "Union Jack IPA"  12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, "BOTTLED ON:11/22/17 14:54"    Notes via stream of consciousness: Its slightly hazy deep golden body rests gently beneath a two finger-thick head of rocky off-white. Only a few bubbles can be seen here and there streaming steadily upwards. The aroma is floral and citrusy with soft grapefruit, moderate pine, and mildly biscuity from the malt. There are no surprises here in that that's exactly what you get in the flavor. A solid bitterness anchors and balances it, and it finishes dry with some bitterness, earthiness, a dollop of sweet biscuity & honeyish malt, and citrusy hops lingering. It's medium bodied and crisp but not too crisp, although it is sharper than what I might normally call "gently crisp". What it offers, like most of the best beers out there, is a richness within its malt, clarity in its hops, a balance between it's components, and a "rounded" character that has no components popping out too much more than any other (keeping in mind that it is a bitter IPA and the bitterness should be a bit elevated). Looking back it's also still got almost a full surface covering of creamy foam, and the lacing is excellent. Very nicely done!   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.75 Poured my can into a pint glass: Wonderful (one of the best softest foams) head, though it did not last to long. Great clarity. My can lacked carbonation, I thought, for style. Aroma was wonderfully crisp and fruity. I sensed some melon, also citrus, but not overpowering, and made you want to immediately taste and taste again. A classic American IPA in all but stated carb profile. I find it probably impossible to only drink one of these--I would really prefer to try this one on tap. I was lucky enough to visit the brewery and sample all the treasures there, but this can lacked luster I thought. All in all, a classic.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 BO 12-21-17  12oz bottle to Becher. Pours crystal clear dark gold. Little head, little lacing.   Aroma is balanced between faint mix of citrus, pine and malts. Little hoppiness. Taste is mildly hopped upfront with a pine bite, followed by a citrus whiff, and a lightly sweetened malt base. MF was light front to back. Hoppy bitterness throughout, yet it was smooth to the point the bitterness wasn't bad at all.     I had mixed feelings with UJ. There was a lot to like for sure, but there was also a letdown in the aroma/flavor department.

Aroma is grapefruit and dank hops, a bit light.    Taste is a great balance of citrus fruit with the malt, earthy, danky, just everything you want out of a strong, solid IPA.    Mouthfeel is medium, good carbonation, strong and solid bitterness, very clean and dry finish.    Overall, really a top-level IPA for something so widely available, really a pleasant sipper to kick back and relax with. Recently drank this after a fresh Sculpin and there was no comparison at all, Union Jack is next level.

Do like the design of the logo and bottle. Simple but stands out.     On pour got a nice big frothy white head, and a lovely clear golden orange beer appeared. Is a nice looking beer for sure, lovely looking colour.     Light carbonation.    On nose got a pleasant fruity aroma, was really lovely to smell. Got citrus and grapefruit.    On the taste side of things, I found it way too hoppy. Now I know this beer is an IPA and popular with the beer geeks, but fuck me I found it very difficult to drink tbh.     Was tasty, did get to savour a bit of it and did get some tasty sweet malts, but those hops, were way too aggressive and bitter for me, yuck!    Also got too much of the citrus flavours, not a nice taste, a bit sour.     Was a strong beer though, did feel the alcohol later!    Disappointing considering all the hype. Maybe if I grew a big fuck off beard it might taste better?

Cutting it close on the 90 day mark but let's see what this "must for all hop heads" has to offer.     L: Clear honey gold, with a massive three finger off-white head off a reasonably aggressive pour. Excellent retention. Thick lacing.     S: Pretty much some solid grapefruit in the aroma, the only other note I pick up is very light malt.     T: Not sure if the time has mellowed the hops but I have a pretty well balanced IPA here, light biscuity malt overwashed slightly with some citrusy hops notes of Grapefruit. This is pretty tasty.     F: Light-Medium body, crisp, slight hop residual linger with a grainy note.     O: All in all a well rounded beer and one I would happily drink again. I will look for a fresher bottle for sure.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 The appearance has a copper colored body with a one finger white foamy head that quickly concaves leaving some nice clingy foamy lacing in its wake. The smell has some pine/grapefruit subtleness with some orange peel in the background and comes out more as it warms. A decent malt background adds a very nice aroma. The taste is mainly sweet through previously mentioned flavors, yet subtly spicy at times but there is a decent bitterness quality coming out through pine/grapefruit (hops, still learning my hops, bear with me). The palate is about a medium, smooth for an AIPA - no worries, under-carbonated - maybe, but perhaps I wasn’t expecting that. Overall, this is a very good AIPA, always worthy of coming back to.

Look- Beautiful amber with constant Champagne-like bubbles emanating from below. Snow white head with moderate lacing.    Smell- Pineapple, citrus and a little mango.    Taste- Bitter pineapple and malt. Quite dry.    Mouthfeel- Creamy on the tongue and swallow. Medium astringency.     Overall- I would drink it again, but feel that there are many better IPAs on the market. I couldn't wrap my head around the extremely high ratings. I paired it with a smoky cheddar from the Rock Face Creamery in Oregon. They complemented each other nicely.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Color is orange-amber. Head is beautiful white and foamy with some white foamy lacing. Palate is medium intensity and balanced with fresh citrus, light pine needles, light perfume notes, some bran breadiness. Palate is delicious; nice solid bitterness to ensure you it's an IPA; fresh grapefruit (!!), lime, lemon, pine needles, sap, pineapple. Body is creamy and lush yet very light and crisp. Pros head and lacing are perfect, intense flavor and solid bitterness but still refreshing, body is uniquely light and fluffy for an IPA. Cons nose is fairly muted especially compared to the palate, long very bitter finish may be intense for some. 97/100.   
look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.25 Look: Prodigious crown with a snowy hue, nice lacing throughout the life of the glass. The beer itself has a pumpkin orange hue.  Smell: Has kind of a citrusy/iodiney (in the best possible way) smell.   Taste: Bitter! The bitterness is perfect and gradual on the pallet. You know that you are drinking an IPA.  Feel: Light and effervescent.  Overall: Formidable west coast IPA, I would certainly drink this again.

Loads of citrus and pine. Slight malt and bread.    Taste: Nice punch of hop bitterness at first sip. Sweet malt rushes in after the bitterness fades. There is a nice earthiness and buttery flavor. Very crisp. After the sweet malt and bread/yeast fade, I'm left with a slightly smoky aftertaste.    Feel: Medium bodied. The Fizz dies out halfway through so it isn't as interesting on the tongue towards the end of the glass.    Overall: Great IPA. Well balanced between the bitterness, sweet caramel malt flavors, and hop flavor (which are citrusy and fruity).

About a finger of head and thick lacing down the glass.    Smell- A blend of grapefruit, pineapple, and other citrus fruits with a nice kicker of piney hops. The West Coast aroma I was expecting.     Taste- The hops and piney quality really come through past the citrus notes. Slightly bitter for an aftertaste and the citrus really evens it out.     Feel- A medium carbonation fee with a nice creamy texture. It sticks with you    Overall- A great West Coast style IPA. A great hoppy bitterness combined with citrus for a super drinkable brew.

Alcohol is well hidden. Very tasty IPA. Not world-changing, but eminently competent.

Nose is fresh citrus hops with tropical hints. Solid start to finish bitterness here without ever being withering or tasting of sawdust. Really nice overall hoppiness with a little balance and the beginnings of alcohol sheen.     I can see why this brew is so well thought of: it is an engineering marvel. It is not my ideal, with a little too much booze and very sharp flavors prior to the aftertaste. However, for whoever designed this brew, it is nearly perfection. It sets out and accomplishes what it wants. For that, I admire it infinitely.

This particular beer was close to its end days, and didn't have a lot of head, but I've had many fresher with a frothy top. Color is lighter than some IPAs , dark gold rather than coppery. Taste is still great, but sharper than Two Hearted and not as sharp as Stone.

Very minor lacing. Aroma is tropical fruits, stone fruits, a little pine, citrus rind, and a touch of caramel. Lots of tropical fruit and stone fruit in the flavor, as well as mild caramel. You can just sit and try to put your finger on all the individual fruit notes that come out of this one. Feel is very dry, full carbonation, and medium body. Good brew.

Finishes quickly   M: medium-high carbonation, medium body.  O: really great beer. This bottle has almost 6 months on it, and it is still exceptional. One more example of FW's mastery of IPA.

Thick lacing, and a glorious ring crowns the brew as it falls, encircling an amber lake and ensorcelling this drinker. Time to put a nose in.    Delicious zest of varied citrus and a fresh, piney hop aroma on a rising, subtle backbone of crackery malt and spice. Wonderful sweet tangerine, and sharper lemon are the stars, and continue to increase for a while. The aroma seems endless. Some other fruit seems to be flitting in the background. Can't make it out, except for a slight, banana-like ester presence. This balances nice with the dominant citrus and pine impression. Glorious, glorious West Coast aroma.    Wonderful pine quality exercises the tongue straight out of the gate. Orange rind on the back half of the sip, as it glides down with that back-end bitterness. Sprightly, crackery, lively malt increases its influence slightly with more exposure of the beer to the tongue, but gives in to a wonderful, hoppy hoppy hop dance every time. Still seems to be just enough as counterpoint to a wonderful, medium + bitterness and a clean, but pungently hoppy, finish.     Medium to medium-light body. Very drinkable with a slight creaminess in the feel that serves as a fantastic sleight-of-hand for a cutting mid-palate rush of carbonation and liveliness.     The standard-bearing west coaster!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Poured to a teku glass.    A: The body is yellow to orange with some relative opaqueness. The head created when pouring was two fingers thick but after a while it transformed itself to a very minimal head but with good retention now. Lots of lacing.  S: The aroma has a very soft profile of pine followed by pineapple and a good hop profile. Since the pine characteristic has been softened here, the aroma is really good. There's some sweetness coming in but I cant't find where from.  T: The taste has some minor sweetness from the malts but then it's a bit acidic and bitter with some pine, pineapple and hops. I was expecting a bit more here.  M: The body is medium to medium high. The carbonation is a bit excessive but the bitterness profile is really good because it leaves a lot of hop flavor that's really fantastic.  O: It's only my third Firestone but I was indeed expecting a bit more here, even though the beer is of course a lot above the average. Since it's an IPA and it was bought online shipping from Belgium to Portugal, I should try it again soon.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured from can into tulip. One finger head dissipated quickly. Nice aroma of pine and I detect some sweet corn for some reason. Very nice initial sip, leading Ng to a wonderful nderful middle and finish. Hoppy, citrusy with the right amount of bitter. Don't detect the juicy orange I sometimes get with sculpin or stone. I'll finish the six pack happily, but not my Fave IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 On the pour very little aroma - some sweet malt and earthy hop is present. Taste is very thick, toasted caramel/butterscotch, sweet malt backbone with earthy/piney hops. There is a thick pine resin hops character throughout this beer that might be very attractive to some hop heads but for the average beer consumer might be construed as offensive. This is a very well crafted IPA that I would argue falls under the DIPA style. This is basically an English bitter on steroids.

An amber like color, this is a professional looking beer, replete with 3/5" white head. Nice dry hop aroma, FW distribution is always a little weird, seemingly getting the beer fresh, you need to be far away from Paso Robles. Plenty of old bottles on shelves near CA.    Taste hits all the right notes, a little bit of toasted pale malt, a little bit of caramel, plenty of hops, assertive bitterness, ample pine notes. Good dry finish. Good price, still in 6 packs.

Feel is medium-light, and carbonated perfectly. Taste is fantastic. First thing that hits me is a little pine, which fades to a fruity taste, then leaves a nice bitterness on the back end of your tongue. This is a bitter IPA, but nothing too intense. It is perfectly balanced in my opinion. This beer is decently priced and available most places here where I live in UT. Very solid beer, yummy.

It forms 1/2 a finger of white head. The head has some longevity and it sticks like crazy to the glass.    S: [3.50] Pineapple, dank resin, lemon rind.    T: [2.75] Pine, tart lemon rind, astringent bitter flavor.    M: [3.50] Good mouthfeel. Nice heft and carbonation. The lingering over-bitterness is a problem on the finish.    O: [3.00] This beer features a flavor that is similar to orange juice after brushing your teeth. It is overly astringent and bitter with nothing to lighten the blow. I am not a fan of the taste.

If they marketed it as a double IPA, it would be spot on. Overall, I liked it, but I would not put it near the top of my favorite IPAs.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Ironic for a beer named Union Jack to have a glistening golden complexion that kind of mimics that of a setting sun. But it still looks mighty and triumphant - bold, blistered highlights shine on while bubbles tirelessly build upon their castle made out of sturdy, ivory white foam. If this is half as good as it looks I'll still be pleased.    Given the name you'd expect an English-leaning IPA - the aroma suggests otherwise. The bouquet is crammed with Pacific Northwest hops. Notes of lemon, pineapple, papaya and pine all rise above the beer's ultra-bready, biscuity malt base. Good thing for the citrus and sweetness because there's an herbal dimension that's so strong as to almost be medicinal.     From first sip right through to finish, alpha acids are hard at work scrubbing away at all that toasted, caramelly maltiness. While many IPAs hint at citrus, there's a tangibly pulpy 'fresh-squeezed' flavour to this one. Notes of orange and grapefruit juice help cut through some of that bitter, 'green', herbal cough remedy note mentioned already.     And while there is four pounds of hops per barrel (which is a lot) most comes in the form of late addition and dry hopping. So contrary to how it may sound, this combination of tree roots and fruit piths blend beautifully with the bakers confectionery and makes for an immensely pleasant beer (provided you sign off on the 7.5% alcohol and 70 IBU).     Sounds odd to say, but Union Jack damn well should be the flagship beer of this American brewery! Firestone Walker kind of made a name for themselves by differentiating with brands like DBA, their Anniversary Series releases and more recently the blended sours made at their Barrelworks location. But their IPA is still up there with the best of them.

I dont find this to be "dank", "juicy" etc. Its a split of floral and resin with a muted malt back. I understand why the purists like it. Years ago when I first tried it, i thought it was the best west coast example, along with sculpin, for a wide distro style. Years later, tons have passed it up.     Nonetheless, it has above average west coast qualities and his stood the test of time. Firestones QC is second to none, so never getting a bad bottle is a plus

You would never guess the ABV because of how smooth it is. Pours a beautiful amber color with a frothy head. The hops are there but toned down, and the beer finishes citrusy. Unlike many other IPAs, this is fantastic on a hot summer day. Must try!!'

Typical west coast style IPA but one that has a lot working for it. Nice lacing and aroma with hints of grapefruit, orange and slight pine. A smooth drinkable IPA with a slight bitter finish. Glad this is a beer I can find in my area almost anytime I look for it.

I had this from a can into a pint glass at The Shack in Houston and was head over heels in love with one of the best IPAs I had ever tasted and then...my server brought me a Yellow Rose (see review) and I had to nudge Jack down one very small notch. This beer had more tropical tastes and the Yellow Rose had more resiny pine and that slightly dankness that I hardly ever get short of a DIPA. Wonderful beer and I feel very happy that it is available in my market (actually much easier to get than the aforementioned local Yellow Rose).

To the best of my knowledge, only Ale Smith can brew IPAs of this quality. And this IPA leaves every Ale Smith IPA in the dust. Quite simply: This is the IPA of our dreams, realized and brewed to perfection. And I'm a DogfishHead 60" IPA guy.:)

Smell: Pungent hops with notes of citrus fruit and a slight earthiness with a sweet bread body.     Taste: Notes of grapefruit zest, and mild hop pine on the attack, followed by a body of ripe apricots, orange peel, and a nice flash of malt with a lingering bitter hop finish.     Feel: Medium bodied. The bodied is elevated a bit by the sticky hops but has no negative effect on drinkability. Perfect body for an IPA. Big enough to let you know it is 7% yet drinks easy. Very slight alcohol on the back of the throat.     Overall: A fantastic IPA that can easily be called the a gold standard for the style. Nice evenly distributed pine and citrus with just enough malt to compliment. A classic.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 From a 3.5-week-old can, pours a clear orange-gold. Two big fingers of off-white head leaves rings of lacing.     Smell and taste are piney hops and grapefruit pith, with a touch of caramel malt. Nice drying bitterness. Medium feel with a bit of smooth slickness. Just a really great west-coast IPA. Delicious.

Interesting that FW went to England to study how the malts interact with wood, came home, couldn't make it work and created a classic AIPA.   Reviewed in the "1001" and with so many top awards in its initial run, I suppose Union Jack deserves to be on the list.

Everything about it hits the mark, from the look and smell to the perfectly balanced finish. If you can find it try this beer and prepare to fall in love.

A complex hop profile laden over toasted malt makes for an intoxicating perfume. Citrus, floral, resinous, and grassy notes exist in harmony both on the nose and the taste buds, which also bear some sugar and spice via caramel malt and peppercorn. Medium-high carbonation hits the tongue right away and provides a dry finish whose bitterness is enhanced by a juicy grapefruit aftertaste. The body is also somewhat creamy, motivating the drinker to sip slowly and enjoy the many layers of this round, balanced recipe. Not too much excitement, but an enjoyable execution devoid of flaws.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours clear orange into a tulip glass from a 330ml can; head is white, 4 fingers high, and smooth with moderate retention. It takes ages to lessen.    The nose is all clementines, grapefruit, lychee, apricots, and some pine underneath. It isn't overpowering like some AIPA's but I got a noseful the second I opened the can. There's also a floral quality to this aroma, as well as a malty, hoppy base.    The taste follows the nose, and then some; tropical fruit, grapefruit, citrus, and melon assault the tongue followed diligently by big resiny pine forest, grass, floral notes, and then coasted over in a fresh, bitter wave of hops which chase the fruit all the way down. It's gorgeously refreshing, sweet, and cool with beautifully balanced flavours. I was shocked to discover this was 7.5% ABV, you can't tell in the slightest.    In the mouth it feels as smooth, wet, and fresh as fruit juice, no oiliness, clinging or drying quality. It's light-medium bodied, with low carbonation.    This for me is one of the better AIPA's out there in terms of balance, and overall refreshing quality. My go-to IPA from now on, this is outstanding.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 From notes taken 03/03/16:    Semi-clear golden amber in glass. Foamy, soapy head tan in color with good retention. Fairly clean smelling, but not weak. Citrus oils mostly, resin and pine in the background. A little biscuity malt aroma as well. Somewhat crackery, somewhat tart, and incredibly citric throughout, especially oranges. Resin and pine again, peppercorn in the back. Perfect bitterness to it. If I wanted a new beer drinker to have a representative West-Coast IPA, this would definitely be an option. Medium-bodied and almost syrupy but for the prickly and then creamy suds, crisp.

I get a little   Taste - Tastes like an English Pale ale with notes of American Hops. Definitely grapefruit and a little citrus, a little pine. but the flavors are a bit muddled. Overall a very good flavor. Mostly it just tastes of hops. My pallet isn't the greatest but I cant pick out much more than grapefruit and a note of citrus, and some pine.   Feel - resinous - you can feel the hop oils on the top of your mouth after you swallow.     A very good example of an american IPA that I suspect is made in the British tradition. need to look up the clone recipe and see how close I was.

Aroma is of pine first, bubblegum second then grapefruit with plenty of dankness. In terms of taste, it's fairly malty, which I don't usually like. It's followed by sticky, fruity sweetness. Bitterness of grapefruit is met with a sturdy malt backbone. The aftertaste is fairly dry. Mouthfeel was good but it was on the harsher end for me. I would think it should be carbed a little further.

Tastes of white grapefruit and lemon rind, mild biscuity caramel malt and gentle resiny pine.    Feels sturdy and creamy. Medium bodied with solid carbonation. Finishes dry.

It shows a crisp malt bill balanced with pungent citrus and piney notes from the hops. Great.    Second tasting on 07/06/18 :       Nice clean gold colour, one finger white head    Distinctive west coast IPA aroma as I open the bottle. Big grapefruit, nice caramel, some resin    Very balanced taste with an emphasis on the malt compared to modern IPAs. Nice bitterness. Refined hoppiness with herbal notes along the obvious grapefruit. Some mineral notes. Some floral notes. Orange. Semi-dry    Vivid champagne like carbonation.     Overall still a perfect example for the style. Even if my bottle is a few months old. I could have this as a go-to. O - 4.5

Beer itself is spectacular looking, with a thinnish head and minimal lacing. Others have said otherwise, and the lack of head's probably due to my overly cautious pour. I think this glass is like 11.5 ounces.    The beer redeems itself on the nose. Citrus-forward, which is what I was looking for. Balanced, with bready and malty notes on the back end.     Taste is much of the same: hop resin on the front end with a complimentary malty finish. This beer does taste every bit of its 7.5% abv. First impression was that of a slightly less aggressive and more "balanced" (in the truest sense of the word, but not necessarily a positive for an admitted hophead like me) taste.    Plenty of carbonation to stand up to the alcohol and bready backbone.    An excellent IPA that'll please hopcentric palates and those who strive for a more traditional "down the middle" hop-malt-balanced beer in this style. Cheers.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Draft. Yard house, LA Live. Shaker. (Re-review 7-27-16, bottle dated 5-16-16).    A: brassy burnished gold, 1/2 finger white head, fades fast. Little carb. Exceptional lacing (lacing not as hot from the bottle, but retention was pretty good).    S: needs to warm up; faintly floral hops. Some resin and citrus. (Sweet floral pine).    T: Like an IPA, a good one. Citrusy, mildly sweet arrival, turning slightly resinous, with a clean (super hoppy) finish that leaves a little tingling citrus (strong lingering floral pine). Quite mild and refreshing. (Not mild at all; starts average, ends strongly bitter).    M: lighter side of medium bodied, less carbonated than I'm accustomed to. Very clean finishing.    O: Not living up to the hype, but I tell you what, this would be in my fridge constantly if I could get it where I live (on second thought, maybe not- too hoppy). Definitely 6-pack worthy (not really). Not a new age fruit bomb, or a tongue scraper 100 IBU monster, just a strong, clean, refreshing IPA. (When I got the receipt at the Yard House, it said Racer 5, not Union Jack. So which was wrong, the receipt, or the beer?)   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Canned on 10/7/15. Poured into a pint glass.    A: Golden in color with a 2 finger head of white foam. After a minute or so the head fades to a thin cap that stays for the remainder of the beer. Multiple streaks of lacing lining the whole glass.    S: Aroma is mainly citrus hops with a small amount of pine in the background.    T: Juicy citrus hop flavors of orange peel with a faint bit of lemon zest. There is some pine on the finish, but it is nowhere near as strong as the citrus hops. This beer has a solid malt backbone that stacks up well to the hops providing excellent balance. In my opinion this beer doesn't have as much grapefruit flavor as everyone says, but maybe mine isn't fresh enough.    M: Medium body with a high amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel is crisp with moderate bitterness and a touch of dryness on the finish. Alcohol is masked very well for 7.5%.    O: Overall I thought this was a solid IPA with crisp citrus hop flavors and excellent balance. The bitterness was not overwhelming and it was very drinkable. I would drink this again for sure.

Now that I live in Texas double jack requires driving further to get and the local grocery store has union jack all the time so its what I can easily get. Its quite wonderful and often my goto IPA now.    Pours a golden color with a two finger white frothy head that is retained pretty well. Significant lacing on the glass. Grapefruit and hops great the nose. The taste is a slight grapefruit and a solid hoppy IPA.

I'm not a fan of grapefruit flavors in a brew, and after reading the reviews describing this great IPA as having that characteristic, I wanted to state for any other grapefruit phobic brewholics that I don't think that this is an accurate description. IMHO, I would think that a "lemon rind" flavor would be a better description. Other than that, I agree that it has a good malt backbone, slightly viscous, with a lingering head.

look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 Nowadays, this is a pretty standard IPA. But I realize I have to come in to this understanding this is more of a classic originator than an imitator.    Light orange amber look, good head with persistent, bridge-forming lacing.    This is solidly West coast, with an emphasis on the bitter over the sweet.    Grapefruit rind nose, with a bit of a lager, even bready backbone--the taste follows identically.    Union Jack slightly scrapes the tongue without lashing like a Zombie Dust or Green Flash might. I can see how this can be a go-to.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Finally had a chance to try this while on vacation in AZ. This is one excellent IPA. BOD 11/06/15 the freshest I could find. Appearance is crystal clear, pale gold with a slightly orange hue. One inch rapidly diminishing head with intricate lacing. Smells of bubblegum, pine, dank and grapefruit. Would like to smell a younger version of this beer but still enticing. The taste is sweet malt, followed by sticky/fruity/vinous hops, then bitterness of grapefruit tempered by the sweet malt with a drying finish. No detectable alcohol for me which is amazing considering the ABV. Lingering grapefruit rind bitterness with just enough malt to balance everything out. Mouthfeel is neither too thick nor too thin and coats the mouth with just enough hop oils and malt to add to the complexity of the flavor profile. This is a sublimely crafted IPA with complex and balanced flavors and aromas. I only wish I could get this beer at home. Well done FW!

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Great IPA here, brought me out for another review. Bought a sixer, since I wanted to try, and was pleasantly surprised.    L: Nice bottle, don't know why it never caught my eye before, but the packaging is rather beautiful. Poured into a sniffer with a clear, very orange amber color with an almost two-finger head that lasts pretty well. Lacing sure hangs on tight.    S: God, can I drink this smell? Delicious. Clean, sour-bitter hop character, like there are dried citrus peels just sitting in the sniffer (so clean it almost smells sharp or metallic, like a knife blade) mango (which smells amazing), a little bit of blackberry and maybe blueberry, and just a hint of soft doughy breadiness underneath the fruit. If this were a candle, I'd buy it on the spot.    T: As always, the taste is everything the smell is but, unfortunately, more. Still very soft, but the grapefruit in particular as well as the funkiness of the bready malts becomes much more pronounced. Tropical fruit, stone fruit, berries, then citrus all blend well, and as the bitterness builds it is counterpointed with a peppery flavor, reminiscent of rye, then finishes in a malty caramel sweetness, but that bitter pepper edge dies last.    F: Awesome: feels clean, just like the smell, not oily, but very smooth. Sticky, with a glasslike feel. Thoroughly carbonated, enjoyable and fulfilling.    O: A great brew. Reminds me of of SN's Torpedo IPA with more hops and less malt. Definitely up there with Bell's Two-Hearted Ale and the other great IPA's!

Tastes like pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, pear, honey, tropical fruit, bready biscuity malt, and dank resinous hops. Feels medium bodied, creamy with moderate carbonation. Perfectly balanced and well-crafted. Overall a great IPA.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 BOD 11/6/15. Clear golden pour with a hint of amber. World class head volume, lacing and retention.    World class nose of massive hops - citrus, tropical and dank. Grapefruit, pineapple, orange, mango and finally a subtle earthy bit of dank with a touch of spicy spruce. Underneath the hop blanket lies a whiff of biscuit.    Medium bodied with a rich oily and creamy texture. Perfect carbonation with a nice effervescent middle and a finely bubbled prickly finish.    The flavor profile is world class. Balance is perfect. Hop flavor is the theme here with a mild bitterness that is quite complex. All aspects of the nose appear. Tropicals lead over a subtle sweetness then flow into the rind components and showcase orange. A slightly bitter middle is balanced with a slightly stronger sweetness (biscuit plus a bit of caramel). As the middle fades, a slight dank hop flavor takes the forefront. The finish is remarkably clean for such an intensely complex ale. As it fades, a slight spicy note arrives. This one is a brewers masterpiece.

Beer is a bit heavily carbonated but is light bodied and very drinkable. Overall a superb beer.

I have been waiting to try this for a while and it didn't disappoint.    L- light golden, with a white two inch head (poured from 12oz can)   S- Citrus, pine and some biscuity malt.  T- Sweet orange zest and grapefruit, followed by pine and hop bitterness all on some light unobtrusive malt backbone.   F- Kind of sticky, medium body and carbonation   O- Wonderful, classic example of the west-coast IPA I have come to absolutely love. I prefer this style of IPA to most (although haven't had any of those east coast hazy guys yet) One of my top 10 IPA's as of now!

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Serving: Can into a snifter  Served: 13 November 2015    Appearance: Pours a lighter color than many other IPAs- looks like a deep golden color with straw-yellow hints, rather than the usual copper toned IPA. Crowned with a soft, soapy white head which sadly dissipates pretty quick. The beer is strong but not so much so that the head should collapse that fast.    Aroma: Massive fruity hoppiness on the nose- huge grapefruit notes, some clementine as well. A bit of resinous pine in there as well. Love the nose.    Taste: Wow, is this a fantastic IPA. Again, huge fruity hop notes - grapefruit, mandarin orange, lemongrass, and cajeput. Again, a pinch of pine, but nothing insane. This is one of the 'juiciest' IPAs I've had in a while and it is absolutely marvelous.    Mouthfeel: Medium body with medium-high carbonation. Dangerously drinkable.    Overall: This beer is similar in character to SN Torpedo, but with a lighter malt backbone. If you want a juicy IPA, this is definitely one to strongly consider. A fantastic beer. Highly recommended.

S: Nuanced and balanced citrusy hoppiness upfront with bisquity/bready malt backing it up. Hops are grapefruity.    T: Prickly bitter citrusy, resinous hops meld with a pleasant bready and slightly caramely maltiness, which is pretty muted throughout. Tastes of bitter orange peel with a bitter semidry finish.    F: Medium body with medium yet prickly carbonation. Mouthfeel is geared towards drinkability, though somewhat lush, with slight lingering warmth.    O: Simply fantastic; easily within my top 5 for the style. Great when one can get it and shows the rest of us how a West Coast style IPA is done.

The beer had a pretty thick head that quickly dissipated to thin retention with thick lacing on the sides. The beer had a somewhat cloudy amber color as well. Generally malty aromas mixed with grape and plum flavors and flowery hops. Really great balance of aromas. Taste is a mixture of different fruit flavors and decent boozy hints. Could taste grapefruit and hops, Good body to this drink too; excellent crispness. Overall, this was a fantastic IPA with some great aromas and flavors.

The smell starts off with bitter citrus rind bleeding into subtle crisp piney notes. There's a delicate spice that I can't quite pick out just yet (for all of the times, I've had this beer, oh sigh, I'll find out some day).  The taste pretty much copies the aroma nicely leading into a sly little bit of the spice into the aftertaste and on into the finish.  The mouthfeel was about light to medium bodied with a great sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed good for this AIPA as there's just enough to show its presence yet still allows the bitterness of the aroma and the taste to be the harshness on my tongue.  Overall, this is a very nice AIPA that I would love to have again and is pretty easy to find as well. Now I just need to figure out that spice.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 This brew is an absolutely clear, golden IPA. The head is tall and luxurious. The aroma is fruit, backed with pungent hops. Earthy, resin, spicy, and intense. Wood is prominent. The taste is sweet in front, and very bitter beginning in the mid-taste. Lots of fresh hop aroma. Long and powerful finish. Great.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 355ml bottle, poured into La Chouffe tulip.     A: Golden, clear, lots of bubbles, decent sized head, lots of lacing.     S: Citrus, pine, resin.     T: Grapefruit, gummibear, hint of apple, lingering bitter finish.     M: Crisp texture, light body, well carbonated.     O: A beer billed as an English style IPA, packed with Cascade, Simcoe and Mosaic hops. Closer to an American or even Imperial take on the style. Well made, hid the booze but it wouldn’t stand out from the multitude of IPAs on the market.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Lovely hazy golden amber with lots of white head, great lacing and retention. An absolutely delicious and beautiful Ipa.

Scents of tropical fruit, mostly pineapple and mango, pine resin at medium-light levels, dank, earthy, weedy hops in the background and light notes of bright citrus.

It showcases a wonderful bouquet and a good amount of flavors on display with a wondrous mouthfeel. This is a very good IPA.

Very potent smells, I picked up lots of citrus and fruit in the aroma with a tiny bit of malt, and a bit of a piney smell. Loved the aromas. Beer went down easy, I didn't pick up as much of a hoppy bite as I'd hoped, nor did I experience the flavors I hoped to taste from the smell. Clean to drink, tasted mainly a malty backbone. Every time I poured, I got a huge amount of head, even when I deliberately slowed the pour. Overall good beer, but not my style of IPA. Would drink again.

Beautiful dark yellow beer with a nice frothy head that leaves nice pacing around the glass.    Smell is yellow grapefruit with a touch of dry malt.    Wow-hop explosion. Pithy grapefruit and just enough malt to balance the beer perfectly. Very Impressed.    Mouthfeel is really nice. This brew moves easily making me want to gulp instead of drink normally.    Overall a world class IPA and worthy of the rating. Wish I could get this in the Cleveland, OH area. Very well crafted and highly recommended.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Love the Firestone I've had before. Now that we have access to more of their stuff here in SA, I am excited to try newer beers too.     Pours a pretty, rich golden straw color. Decent lace. The nose is easy going grapefruit with a hint of pine and alcohol. Taste is big and hoppy, with strong citrus flavors and chewy grass and pine mixed in. Boozy but not unpleasant. Strong bitter finish doesn't let go easily. Firm mouthfeel.     I really like this beer. Maybe not a great session ale due to the ABV, but I could still put 2-3 back in a sitting without any trouble. Reminds me of the Grapefruit Sculpin from Ballast Point, to be honest, just with a little less citrus; but along those lines. I'll revisit the Union Jack again. Cheers.

It's very inviting.    It smells terrific, if you like tropical fruit - a lot! Union Jack is in the running for the best aroma of any IPA.    The taste and feel are as one with this IPA: absolutely unleashed esters and fruit. The sensation is one of absolutely swimming in esters. I honestly have to do a gut check after the first quaff. There is a moment of queasiness that results from this kind of ester riot. Now, I realize these esters are totally controlled and are exactly where Firestone wanted them to be. They also lend complexity to the brew. After you get used to it, you can enjoy it. And yet . . . and yet . . . this IPA is in my humble opinion when craft brewing in general and professional reviewers specifically - who absolutely rave about Union Jack - went over the top. I mean Firestone blew through the top like they were in the elevator in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I know they did it on purpose. I appreciate the achievement of making an ale that's as complex as a wine, and that even really reminds me of wine. Yet, I don't like it. I'll take my Stone, my Lagunitas or a Sierra Nevada pine meadow of a Torpedo any day over this queasy ester riot. I'll splurge on the balanced grapefruit of Total Domination. I'll even take a Rebel and decant it for a few minutes to vent the dry-hop excess, and then enjoy it's grapefruit, or really go nuts and splurge on a Sculpin grapefruit. Now that's actual fruit, not just unchained yeast esters. For me, Union Jack is over the top and I won't buy it again.     How extreme is the taste? I notice Firestone began making an excellent pilsner recently. Imho the move back towards lagers in general and pilsners in particular is a reaction to going over-the-top on IPAs like Union Jack. There's a top, for me at least, in the fruity ester direction at least. This one's over it.    The solution to over-the-top IPAs is not boring brews. It's different IPAs. Stone is bitter enough, but not too much, and never an ester riot.     Now, one may argue that Torpedo is over the top and yet I love it, but Torpedo's a different aesthetic than fruity esters. Also, with Torpedo, I trade off Nooner which makes them both sublime.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 A deliciously crisp brew with a great balance of tropical fruits in both taste and smell as well as a piney, sticky finish. The malt complemented it well, but I think they could've made this beer elite if they tinkered with the recipe a bit.

Hopefully some of the hop flavors have still held up. With that in mind, I'll review this beer with a grain of salt and re-review if I can find it fresher.    LOOK: Slightly hazy golden orange with steady bubble streams and a finger and a half of creamy white head. Looks delicious.    SMELL: Yes! I can still smell hops. Actually, even for its age this smells delicious. Orange peel and toasted caramel maltiness meets sweet apricot, peach, and pineapple aromas. Yum!    TASTE: Very nice. A nice balance of citrus and tropical fruits with a steady but never overpowering malt backbone. Imagine a mix of Bell's Two Hearted Ale and Sculpin. That's how this tastes. Tangerine and grapefruit juice upfront, toasted malt and caramel in the middle, followed by apricot, mango, peach, and pineapple, and then finishes with grapefruit pith, bitter pineapple, and light pine. Sweet and juicy, balanced with just enough bitterness. I would kill to get this fresh!    FEEL: Medium, approaching full. Nicely carbonated. Slightly creamy. Super drinkable. Dry on the finish. Refreshing.    OVERALL: Wow. Just wow. This is how I like an IPA, and this isn't even fresh! New favorite IPA...?

Tons of citrus and fruits in the smell.     Just like the smell. Great job showing the flavor of all these different fruits. Definitely on the hoppy side.     Medium body with high carbonation. Very fresh feel    Great beer. Glad I was able to try this one. Would love to find more.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This is one of my favorites, ever since I have had it. A great IPA/IIPA. Something about the first sip always turns me off a little bit, but then it really hits the spot. Golden amber color. Great lace, sweet aroma, dank hops, love it. After that it is nothing but sweet and blissfully harmony. When I see these at the store I generally buy all the bottles I can.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA- 7.5% abv.    A: a lightly toasted amber brown with bubbly head which recedes to a still boisterous amount of white foam.    S: mad fruity, I get pine and peach and pineapple.    T: hop bite with the fruit juiciness, basically like it smells- pineapple peach, but with orange peel and sweet grain backing.    M: juicy as hell, with lots of hop bite and sweet malt syrupiness. Kinda chewy but drinkable.    O: A big West Coast IPA that is very well balanced despite having as much alcohol as Olde English 800. Very delicious and goes down quick. One of my go to beers. It's got everyday-beer distribution here in Portland, so it's a good option for those of us who can't always get to a bottle shop to find other famous IPAs. I've never had Heady Topper but I bet a lot of Vermont drinkers have never had this. 4.7/5.
