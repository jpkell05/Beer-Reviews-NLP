look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 (2019)    A: Pours a light copper-orange when held to the light. Has a quickly dissipating white foam head.     S: The honey actually comes through a little bit, along with a faint floral aroma.     T: Overall, the taste is a balanced mixture of the quintessential west-coast floral/pine hop profile and a dollop of honey. I like the addition of honey, as it provides a unique alternative to the "malt backbone" that other DIPAs have. In particular, the flavors I get on this beer are sweet grapefruit, pinecone, honey, orange pith, and a dank oily hop presence.     M: I'd say this is on the heavier side, but with enough carbonation to balance things out. It's obviously not stout-like.     O: Wonderful beer. To me, Hopslam's flavor has a story: it's a beer that once was a typical west-coast DIPA, lost in the sea of millions of the same style. But then, somehow, it got bit by a radioactive bee and turned into a super honey-infused west-coast DIPA that saved the city.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured a transparent copper with a finger high head. I must admit, I neglected to read that this is a double brewed with honey, so I wasn't expecting the honey to be worked into the bouquet. It wasn't cloying, and turned out to be quite the harmonious aspect on the palate, balancing out the deep piney bitterness and working well with the citrus rind. Good snag, as always with Bells.

Crystal clear copper color and decent, soapy lacing. The aroma hit me from the moment it hit the table. Nice and floral and fruity and very citrus forward. The flavor is in the pocket for a double IPA. Great beer, would drink again in a heartbeat.

Appearance: Clear, bright bronze gold color with a towering head of white bubbly foam. Heads holds well and leaves and intricate lace pattern.    Smell: Pine needles and citrus zest (lemon, grapefruit) rounded out by warmer caramel malt and fruity hop notes. Faint hints of alcohol sneak through.    Taste: Boldly bitter, but balanced. Pine and citrus continue from the nose, along with crisp leafy bitterness. Full bodied malt and honey notes provide a welcome balance.    Mouthfeel: Medium body with a smooth, oily feel, and moderate carbonation.    Overall: Terrifically balanced and integrated DIPA with plenty of hip goodness but malt (and honey) to match.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 12oz can. Brew date 01/07/19. Poured into English pint glass.  Very light copper hue with a touch of gold. Thin white head disappears to just cover the surface clinging to glass.  Pine hop scent with a citrus chaser.  I am an IPA novice so I prefer a bit less on the IBU scale. This beer lands right in my wheelhouse with a bite of hop with a smooth slightly rich yet clean taste and finish. The 10% is nowhere to be found giving it an insane drinkablity.   Just enough fizz to tingle the tongue with a easy medium feel.  Honey plays a part in this beer and for me creates a very unique imperial IPA that I very much enjoy.  I try to rate a beer as it is, not as it could or should be. Yes it’s expensive but well worth the cost, especially to share and surprise a fellow beer drinker.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 L- Pours a nice rocky two finger headed Imperial IPA with an amber-gold appearance. The liquid is all together clear.   S- Wonderful hop presence throughout. Grassy, piney, floral, and citrusy hops are all present. An extremely inviting aroma that is very sweet. Very little alcohol picked up, if any. For 10.00 that's insane.  T- The taste is extremely well thought out, and surprisingly refreshing for an imperial IPA. Citrusy and fruity hops make up for a sweet and malty flavor immediately. The flavor is abrupt, refreshing, and memorable.  F- Medium bodied, but extremely fresh and rewarding. Nice carbonation at the end.   O- Probably the best imperial IPA I have every had. It packs a punch alcohol wise, and you can't even tell there is any there... A bit dangerous I could say. But it's pretty astonishingly refreshing. The hop presence is lively and fresh, and it's as sweet as you could imagine. Altogether beautifully made beer. I loved every sip of it.

Pours a very clear light amber with a medium head that lingers for a long time.   Smell: light, sweet, hoppy, dried fruit  Taste: stronger than smell. Good balance of sweet and bitter. Bitterness lingers on the palate but with rich flavor. Notes are honey, dried fruit, pear, floral, mild pine, and a touch earthy. At 10%, the alcohol is very noticeable. The honey adds a nice balance of sweetness that is not overbearing.   Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and full-bodied.     Very nice IIPA! Definitely worth looking for. Price tag is high, so good for special occasions.

A deep amber on this beer, nearly verging on a red ale's color. The head dissipates at a moderate pace, leaving behind bountiful lace. On the nose it's round, sweet, and spicy. Milder than I imagined, but altogether supremely well balanced. A cacophony of flavor from the get-go, with the best texture to a beer I've perhaps ever tasted. Utterly creamy and decadent, with significant grassy and malty notes to go around. Strong taste of weed, much like a Stella has, but with a good wheaty kick at the end. The beer keeps on giving, with something new to taste every sip. Ultimately, I will have to drink this with food. There's simply too much flavor to stand on its own, and I'm getting overstimulated with each taste. If this is your jam, pick up this beer. It's really something, and I'm terrifically impressed by Bell's yet again.

Aromas of citrus, pine and some fruit. Taste combines some maltiness with citrus/pine and a bit of bitterness on the finish. Mouth feel is medium-heavy, but not overly sweet or heavy for the ABV....still pretty drinkable. Overall, a pretty good high-octane DIPA.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Really late to the party here as Bell's only started NJ distribution in the past year. Hopslam is amber in color, the pour yielding a nice two fingers of foam that sticks around. Tons of lacing. As IPAs go, this isn't super aromatic. It's very floral, and that's backed up by some ripe stonefruit notes. There's a very solid malt backbone underpinning the flavor profile. Pretty high in sweetness / residual sugars as something labeled an "IPA" goes, though not out of character for a 10% ABV monster. A touch of lingering hop bitterness on the finish. As a strong ale that's hoppy but with a pronounced malt sweetness, I could see this maybe being recategorized into the somewhat nebulous American Strong Ale style.

I got (2) fresh cans from a co-worker canned 01/17/2019 - so glad I did not shell out $20 USD for this...I will power through them and then move on to some good beer..like Founders Centennial.

Poured golden liquid into a glass and watched it rest beneath a puffy white head. Looks the part of an excellently crafted non-hazy IPA, for sure - more clear than cloudy, equal parts amber and honey-gold.    Aroma is ruby red grapefruit, caramel, honey, pine and orange zest. Wonderful balance considering the double-digit ABV. Taste is right there with a touch of honey-sweetness followed by an subtle earthiness.    Smooth as all get-out with reasonable alcohol heat. The feel and surprising drink-ability are its greatest strengths.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Canned on 1/10/19    Pours a deep golden burnt orange with a steady white head; higher level retention eventually leaves a formidable wall of semi-thick lacing; a clear, exceptional-looking nectar of a beer.    Aroma brings concentrated notes of ultra-dank pine, herbal sweet malts, pithy grapefruit, a pungent forality, and dank citrus rind; more of a hop-malt balance upfront here, with the bouquet hinting toward an underlying intensity.    Taste hints of dank citrus rind with an intense stream of raw hop resin coursing through the center of the profile onward, and touched by hints of honeyed malt toward the back end; intense, bitter, but excellently balanced by the honey.    Mouthfeel shows an incredibly smooth medium body topped with creamy carbonation; prickly and hugely refreshing resinous tones from the hops build throughout; primarily dry near the finish, but with an almost syrupy slickness faintly in the background adding some depth.    Excellently-crafted heavy hitter of an older style IPA; impressive in its balance of both flavor profile and mouthfeel, as well as a finely-tuned, condensed hop intensity. Spectacular drinkability for a 10%er, too.

The highly-vaunted HopSlam finally flows into my glass via a can dated 1/9/19, meaning that not only did Bell's recently get distribution in New England, but they're paying extra-good attention to the dates they get stuff out here by! Now that is how you treat a new market... I feel very lucky to have this beer right now, that's for sure. I've heard so much about it, and now it's finally time to sink my teeth into it.    Pours a slightly-hazy medium-amber/golden color with no notable hop/yeast particulate in the body. Head builds up to about three fingers at first, but eventually it settles to about a half-finger with soapy lace show and medium legs. Surface is pretty much covered in the same foam, but a little less dense. A fairly good pour with an air of classiness to it. It's not crazy, but it's not boring or underwhelming. I approve!    The nose reminds me a lot of Sierra Nevada's Hop Bullet, and maybe I'll get some hate for comparing an older beer by a much-loved brewery to a newer IPA from an even-older, maybe-more-well-liked brewery, but that was the first thing that came to mind. Strong tangerine/grapefruit and lemon verbena notes with some catty dankness and pine resin. Slight peach/nectarine with a little suggestion of the honey they used in this one. I have had some excellent honey-infused IPAs over the past year or two, and this is definitely the godfather of such an idea, and it deserves to be appreciated for that! That said, I would like this to be a little more aromatic than it is... it doesn't jump out of the glass quite as much as I'd prefer.    On the other hand, the flavor profile is sticky and super-satisfying. I get a bit of citrusy juiciness right upfront combined with some suggestions of stone fruit, grassy hops, pine-resin stickiness and pithy bitterness toward the finish. The honey is prevalent here, surprisingly enough. It really punches through the semi-heavy body and gives a nice balance to the proceedings. I was assuming it would totally be fermented out, but I was proven wrong... light florals and herbal elements definitely congeal in the mid-to-finish of each sip, lending a very full bodied and complex flavor to this classic. And I now understand why it is considered a classic. It may have been the first commercially-distributed triple IPA, after all. Why isn't that a style on BA...?   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Pours an amber light haze with a solid head and great lacing. Smells of great citrus, pine and light malt. Taste is too smooth for the novice. The booze is totally hidden in the great beer. Packs quite the punch at 10% but overall this is a Top tier DIPA that you should buy in quantities when you can find it.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A: Pours a copper color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap    S: A good mix of citrus, floral, and fruity hops along with a light malt sweetness    T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the citrus and floral hop notes and then picks up some of the residual sweetness from the honey and a bit of booziness. Finishes with lingering grapefruit and floral notes    M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation    O: A great DIPA that is far too easy to drink for being 10%. One of the classics for a reason

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2019 batch. 9 day old can! Poured into a tulip pint glass.   Look : Crystal-clear, deep amber color with a white head that settles into a cap and retains for quite a while.     Smell: Resinous and somewhat dank. Primarily lemon zest, but also some orange and grapefruit on the tail end. Some booziness.    Taste: Sweet honey and resin upfront, a little grass. Grapefruit, some sweet citrus and pine, a hint of lemon. A touch of breadiness to balance out the sweetness, but I know it'll only build as this beer gets older.     Feel: Drinks super light right now for 10%. Semi-oily and smooth, clean finish but not dry.     Overall: This beer is really nice when super fresh. Stands out from the rest of today's DIPAs with its huge honey sweetness, doesn't veer towards the pine bomb WCIPAs that much or NEIPAs in the slightest. Still a winner 15(?) years after batch 1, at least when fresh. I remember standing in lines for this bad boy, now it's almost always readily available when in season. Drink this fresh unless you want a pseudo barleywine!

Rocky white head retains well. Clumpy lacing.    S: Candied lemon, sugared white grapefruit, orange pulp. Grassy with a bit of an earthy/herbal tone too. Clover honey. Caramel and pound cake.    T: Green and oily up front with soft herbal tones and perhaps a touch of scallion. This soon transitions to full blown citrus. Bitter white grapefruit, lemon peel, pulpy orange. Bitterness is firm and clamping, reaching its apex on the back end. Honey, caramel, and pound cake sweetness help to keep it tethered. Brush of alcohol. Honey, orange slices, and some firm bitterness on the finish.    M: Full body with a chewy feel. Definitely some residual sugars. Some heft, but it isn't too weighty. Hop astringency grips at the tooth enamel a little bit.     O: A one-two punch of honey and malt sweetness and citrusy and green hop bitterness. It hits it's balance perfectly. A big beer, but not too hard to drink. This used to be an occasional treat in the rare instances I came across it in my travels in years past. Now it's available in my home market, with impressive freshness! Score!

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12oz can. Pours a clear brownish orange with an inch of creamy head. Tons of lacing. First whiff is a nice hoppy aroma of grapefruit, pine, honey and floral hops. Maybe a hint of plum. The taste has a good deal of tea and floral hops to it followed by some pine and honey. Grapefruit and nectarine towards the finish with bread crust, more honey and a finish of tea. Oily mouthfeel. Heavy with a very noticeable alcohol presence. This one alluded me for years and I’m glad I finally got to have some. Very good Imperial IPA worth seeking out.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A very impressive, fantastic-tasting double IPA from a great local brewery. Pours a nice amber color with some white fluffy head and some spotty lingering lacing consisting mainly of fine bubbles. Smells of a good mixture of fruity citrus hops, herbal hops and some weaker piney hops. There are also some nice aromas of caramel, vanilla and malt. The taste is outstanding and consists of loads of fruit: grapefruit, lemon, orange, tangerine, mango and passionfruit. There’s also some weaker piney hops, herbal hops, malt, caramel, bread and vanilla. Smooth mild mouthfeel with a little bit of creaminess the coats the palate. Nice carbonation. Outstanding flavors with a great balance between the slightly bitter hoppiness and sweeter malt backbone. Perfect amount of bitterness at the finish. The higher ABV is very well-hidden and this could almost fool you into thinking it was a regular IPA (by alcohol content, not flavor). This is definitely one of my top three imperial IPAs sampled in the past year.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Date: Canned on 01/15/19, revisited on 01/21/19.    Appearance: Pours out a nice dark and almost hazy copper orange color with two fingers worth fluffy off white head. Fairly standard but it looks nice.    Aroma: While I am no haze craze fanboy, I will admit that they by and large are much more aeromatic. Not to say that this doesn’t smell good, it does but it never seems to explode with the bouquet of aromas which I am now used to. Anyway, I get a lot of sweet honey up front which has an almost burnt aspect to it or perhaps caramelized is a more accurate word. There is also the standard pine, bitter grapefruit zest, and a decent amount of tea leaf aroma and green onion. For it’s name, Hopslam lacks some of the deep, bitter, resinous elements of other double and triple IPAs, at least on the aroma.    Taste: The taste fairs better than the nose as there is an initial rush of assorted hops that overtake the palate before dropping back to allow for the honey to come forward. The honey sweetness rises quite quickly and just as the question “is this getting too sweet?” creeps into my head, the hops return with that deep resinous prickly hop bite and bitterness that was missing from the nose. While the bitterness isn’t anything wildly out of the norm for an IPA this big, the fresh hop bite lingers for a good while and has a little spicy burn. There is a notable floral taste in here as well, perhaps it is a hop variety or maybe they used wildflower honey. I also get some deep herbal notes as well, but nothing that is really definable. The mouthfeel is medium-full standard DIPA style and pleasant enough. It has a standard chunky malt backbone which veers a little too close to the syrup like character of say Dogfish Head 90 Minute. The rush for Hopslam seems to have subsided over the past several years and I can understand why to some degree. The first time I had it, I thought it was awesome, of course that was three hundred beers ago. It is still a well made and enjoyable offering but for the price and limited timeframe of availability, it simply cannot compete with many of the beers being churned out by many of the newer smaller more adventurous local breweries. I get the feeling that Bells has become complacent riding on Hopslam and several other limited releases, everything now unfortunately feels old hat about this one. Hopslam even has some trouble when compared to the, honestly somewhat better and cheaper year round offerings like Stone Ruination.

Peppery, spicey finish.  Surprisingly smooth, a little sticky. Medium body. Medium carbonation.

I decided not to review back then, figuring maybe I was just missing a DIPA boat because I'm really more a stout guy. It's really hot outside now, I like cold IPA style when it's hot, I saw the beer store clerk had this stashed in a cold hiding place, so I bought it for a second try.     Waaaay better than last time! In hindsight, the first cans were comparatively flat and syrupy, so they were probably allowed to get too warm. This batch is delicious. Nose is lemony, grapefruity up front, maybe some pine in the back. Color is slightly hazy yellow-gold. Poured hard into a barrel glass created a small head that persisted, due to a crazy amount of carbonation. This has been the first time I've seen that level of active bubbles from deep down the glass since I had Pliny the Elder forever ago. Side note: if there's anything local in the Buffalo, NY area I can trade for some Pliny...hit me up!     First sips are citrus and pine, slightly bitter but balanced by the honey. Very crisp mouthfeel, refreshing aftertaste. Alcohol hides well, but has a slight presence. Very easy drinker on this hot, humid night.    Considering how the carbonation really made the difference, IMO, from last time with Hopslam, I think this might be the same issue I had with the Lawson's Sip Of Sunshine, so I might have to retry a pack that has stayed frosty.

Pours a deep orange, with a nice three finger head of frothy foam that leaves patches of heavy lace as it settles.    A vibrant array of lemon, grass, and floral hops hit your nose. Fresh honey and light bready malt linger.     The flavors here are really nice. The honey isn’t overwhelming or too sweet, and the bitter, floral hops return and dissolve into a malty finish. A good balance, well done.    Medium body, medium carb.. not too sticky, a little filmy.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Canned Jan. 10 2018, drank April 21, 2018.  Pours a light amber, Thick off-white foam head. Lot of lacing, and held the head well.  Get a lot of sweet malts in the nose, along with some caramel. I’m not getting much citrus like other raters.    Taste follows the nose for me with some (not overwhelming) hop flavor at the finish.     Full, chewy body, and moderate carbonation. Great body IMO.     Overall just decent, though it may be well past it’s prime.

I’m sure beer nerds everywhere are reading this gasping because I’m downing what most consider a well rounded dipa. I just don’t see what all the fuss is about and how this overly expensive beer flies off the shelf when there are much cheaper and better options available

Nose is very faint with light bready malt and some floral and earthy notes. Maybe some grapefruit peel. Im not really getting much to be honest. Taste up front is grapefruit subdued by some malt backbone. Followed quickly into mid palate orange with some noticeable alcohol burn. I get some subtle honey but thats probably bevause im looking for it. Rather clean end palate with lingering burn from the booze. Mouthfeel is nice with adequate coating of the palate. For all the hype i expected more. This seems to be an average beer with nothing that really stands out. Nothing i would seek out and although nothing is offputting and the balance is there the sky high ratings confuse me a little.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Drinking a 6-pack just prior to the 60 day mark, so it is reasonably fresh. Pours a relatively clear copper orange with medium head that leaves good lace. Nose is not as big as I expected, and has some dank pine and citrus. Taste is more orange rind and some caramel. Obviously a big beer, but holds it well for 10% abv. Overall, I liked it but don’t get the uber high scores here.

look: 2.5 | smell: 2 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.25 Poured on tap at a bar in Tempe, Arizona.    Pours a clear golden color with a white sheet of head. Leaves zero lacing before the head completely dissipates into nothingness.    The aroma brings notes of pine. That's it. Hey I love a good pine bomb but I also like balance. No honey, no citrus, no tropical fruits. Just pine. A lumberjack wouldn't like this shit.    The taste actually brings some citrus into the mix. There's some oranges and a touch of grapefruit before a wave of chalky aspirin humps my taste buds. There's some malt on the backbone so it gets a point for that. Otherwise, entirely bland and unnecessarily bitter.    The feel is thin with moderate carbonation. It's thin, yet somehow sticky. Solve that one, nerds. Alcohol is barely present which is neat.    Overall, a pretty damn awful DIPA. I don't care how hyped up this beer is, I just didn't like it. I'd gladly give it another chance if I ever got some bottles but other than that I'm not impressed. Hopefully a bad batch.

Taste: Strong and bitter with sweet, orange citrus and a hint of honey.    Mouthfeel: Crisp and clean but bone and unwavering, with good carbonation.    Overall: A bit sweeter than I like in my DIPAs, but this is a very good beer, as I was gifted a 6-pack. The ABV is rather evident, as the beer drinks rather hot, all the way through.

Taste is amazing for a double IPA you can't really taste the booze and it's hard to wrap my head around this beer being 10% ABV. Overall this beer is my favorite beer that Bells Brewery releases every year and will for sure pick up another 6 pack when this one runs out.

Creamy mouthfeel, long finish, more than enough hops to keep it dry in the finish. Some heat, doesn't seem like 10% worth of heat though.  Really good, first year it;s been available in TX, glad to get a hold of 6.

The sweet and bitterness are well balanced and will linger for sometime. Real smooth carbonation with a creamy texture. Very nice!

This beer is honey colored with a thick soapy cream colored cap that leaves sheets of lacing.     Aroma hinges on dank hops with a woody bite.     The taste is subtly sweet with added honey, sharp bitterness and wood drive the finish.    The mouthfeel is dry and woody.    Overall, I would be hard pressed to pay $18 for another six pack of this.

This beer looks like a regular lager but has a beautiful head. It smells divine. It doesn't have the malt some DIPA's do so it doesn't have the sweet aroma but the hops make it a good smeller. The honey plays a great hidden role in this beer The head fades and the lacing is great. The taste is good and the alcohol is acceptable.  I can't tell I'm drinking a 10 percenter , so smooth, delicious and satisfying. But you'll take notice after two of these bad-boys, if it takes that long. A great beer overall that uses honey to sweeten it as opposed to malts. Worth trying for sure and a nice change for DIPAs. Fresh canned 1/15/19 poured into a Spiegelau glass.

Here is my best shot.  Look: pours smooth amber orange with a nice head yet still quite clear. Little to no Haze.  Smell: Pungent smell of citrus, pine, earthy, and resinous hops in what seems to be mostly flavor. Not the sharp clean scent of a dry hop, but rather a plethera of hops covering a strong honey malt smell.  Taste: Strong, bitter, and in your face. To those that may feel this is a turn off, trust me, this is not. This is a high gravity beer, so expecting anything “light and breezy” would just be a novice mistake. This beer has been hopped in a wild and Cluster f***ed of a manner to balance the dry honey base and full carmel malty body.   Feel: In all, the beer lathers the palate with warm, carmely honey notes, and yet the string of a complex bitterness. The high abv definitely lingers, but for a beer this big that is a moot point.    Overall, definitely my favorite beer from Bell’s. Coming from Michigan, I am uber critical of beers, but I am glad to see that the high demand from across the country has still proven to the success of this beauty!

Leaves a remarkable amount of lacing down through the glass, making it obvious where the glass emptied down to on each sip. Smell is citrus and floral notes, and honey. Taste is similar but hops come through more clearly. Feel is a touch dry, but this seems to be balanced a bit by the honey. Still, the dryness lingers. Overall, solid beer, nothing less than I’d expect from Bell’s. Not quite worth the hype, maybe, but a good beer.

Not my favorite that I have tried, but I would put it at #4, under Hoptimum, Double Jack, and Unfiltered Enjoy By. Probably the mildest in flavor of those.    L: Transparent orange body with a bit of haze. Tons of head, tons of carbonation, and sticky lacing. Looks as expected.    A: Definitely a lot of Simcoe. Papaya, passion fruit, pineapple, orange and lemon lead, with some plum and raspberry in the middle, and pine and grapefruit for the finish. This smells very West Coast, surprisingly. A bit of malt comes through with a funk very similar to BO and some honey.    T: Super drinkable for the abv. Holy crap this is impressively tasty. Honey is an extremely important part of this beer, and it fits like a man in a tailored suit. The tropical fruit is balanced at first by a strong white pepper note, then the sweetness from the honey flares up, then the pine and grapefruit bitterness sets in, taking it to a smooth, but strongly herbal finish, fitting to the style.    F: Damn. Just enough body, and yet super crisp.     O: This is the best brew I've had from Bell's yet. Super flavorful, but not too wild. At $20 a six-pack, however, I don't see myself buying very many of these in the near future.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.75 One could immediately tell that Hopslam was meant to be a quality beer- the taste and aroma is there- but unfortunately, I think Bell let the 10% alcohol content interfere with the taste. The beer's profile yields a little "bite" that becomes distracting as the brew is consumed. A little more smoothness would push this beer into the 4.1-4.3 range.

I have had IPA's I really much prefer and this one has a tail end of tastes that just do not work for my palette.

Stoney and sweet nose that isn’t as prominent as I would have thought. Much more malty and alcohol tinted than I would have thought with medium bitterness but pretty decent. Thinner with ample carbonation. I give this props for the 10% but Imperials have moved past this in terms of flavor, nose and look for sure.

There is an underlying slightly sweet something that may be malt, or honey, or both.    Flavor on entry is hop forward with a surge that jumps out and lands with both feet on the palate. There is a firm bitterness that quickly builds larger all the way into the aftertaste where it features prominently. I searched for sweetness but didn't really notice any except in the back of the palate where it moderated the hops somewhat.    Full texture with balancing carbonation.    Altogether an interesting brew that plays a wide range of flavor notes from low to high in a fairly well integrated and complex fashion.

Hop heads should go for this bad boy.    Pintglass on tap at a skibar. Didn't pair well with KBBQ but amazing.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Fresh-smelling citrus, tropical-perhaps pineapple, with a touch of pine. Hazy golden amber with a tall slightly off-white thick head, that fades slowly with plenty of lacing. Smooth initial taste, plenty there providing a body under the hops - perhaps the honey?, citrus, middle is a bit bitter, with a strongly bitter finish and aftertaste. Very well balanced with plenty of malt supporting the hops and very slightly sweet from the honey. Moderately thick mouth feel. Bitter with a moderation from the malts and honey in the finish, eventually transitioning to a bitter lingering aftertaste. An excellent "old school" DIPA with the extra smoothing and sweetness added by the honey. Well worth the reputation and the price.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a can into a pub glass    Pours a pleasingly-hazy nearly-amber with an excellent pillowy head and fine retention, particularly for the ABV.    The aromas are strong and not at all muddled--juicy grapefruit, honey, and floral notes all take turns pleasing the nose.    The flavors are equally nuanced and enjoyable, although there is just a hint of "burn" from the booze that is a little heavy, even for the double-IPA style.    The mouthfeel is excellent. Slick and crisp all at once, with plenty of body, but no extra weight.    Overall, an excellent double IPA, although just a little to much boozy burn keeps this out of five-star territory.

AROMA: floral hops, wood, the lighter side of pine.   TASTE: upfront, the honey sweetens the bitter resinous piney hop flavor, but the finish is a bit rougher as the sweetness fades.   FEEL: super thick and creamy for an IPA. Smooth sipping. The best attribute.    Glad I finally tried this. Well crafted and unique, but not my style.    **  **

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25 Pours a reeeeally pretty clear dark gold, nicw thick foamy head that dissipates after a few minutes but covers the glass with sticky lacing. Smells pineapplely with some pear and green apple, i barely detect the honey but its there. Taste was a lil mehh for me as there wasn't much to make it stand out from many others. Really well balanced but there's no explanation point anywhere that brings the hype. Grapefruit and pine, but not too bitter or astringent, not too sweet either which i find a problem with a lot of dipas. No honey taste for me. Mouthfeel was spot on though, you knew you were drinking a hefty beer on abv but still extremely smooth and perfect balance between crisp and sticky. Overall great beer but will probably be the last hopslam i buy, way too pricey. Price analogy: If two hearted and hopslam were in school, two hearted would be the kid that put their time in studying but went to the bar every night, got laid and still got an A; hopslam lived in the library 24/7 and got an A+... id rather chill with two-hearted.

The moderately strong nose is a highlight. It has a nice juicy hop aroma with a full pineapple-pear cocktail note that goes the distance.    The taste doesn't have as much of the juice but is balanced and very smooth. The alcohol is apparent but doesn't seem to detract from the overall taste. Some sweetness is layered in with the hop bitterness but I'm not picking out any honey in particular. The finish is rather clean with a small zesty aftertaste.    The body is to the light side of medium and I find the carbonation to be in the same neighborhood.    Damn good brew! I would say recommended but I think the word is already out on this one.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 This beer is drinking swell this year. 1/2 finger of head in a pint glass, tight bubbles of foam around the edges. The beer smells wonderful. This has always been a particular strength of Hopslam. Smells like pineapple. Taste is a little more bitter than would be ideal, big pineapple on the back palate. Hop bite is real. Don't expect your wife or girlfriend who drinks fruited Berliners to enjoy more than a nip of this Light to slightly above light feel. Not a problem for the style.    Very noticeable lacing on the glass. Plenty carbonated.    It's been very popular for the last 5 years or so to put the knock on this beer and to complain about how it's become dated and doesn't hold it's own against the current crop of haze/juice bombs. This may be true to a certain extent but like way too many things these days, it's mostly predatory anti-hype. Hopslam is still an excellent double IPA, well worth picking up once a year.    Very pricey though, I do agree with this. Enjoy.

Grapefruit, apricot, tangerine, a little yeast aroma.  Subtle citrus, soft pine, I get the honey, not sweet, but muting the hop bittering, along with the malt.  Very full and smooth, full persistent carbonation, dry finish, no alcohol burn.  Always a consistent delicious DIPA, flavors a bit thin compared to my favorites, but I'm good for a few sixpacks every year.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 2018 batch. Excellent! Brewed with honey, but not overly sweet.

If I could actually find my snifter I would've used that. You will not be disappointed. Grab some while it's available.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 I assumed this beer was overhyped but I was wrong. Let me start this by saying I do NOT like IPAs and do I did not expect to like this. Pour is a really nice light golden color with a good head that recedes but lingers throughout. Honestly the smell is my least favorite part of this beer because it reminds me of straight up pine. But the taste... man it is delicious. And to reiterate, I really, really do not like IPAs or even most light beers, but this stuff is exceptional. It’s the perfect balance of bitter and sweet. The hops are definitely really prominent but it’s also got a really smooth, sweet wave that’s predominately honey with a bit of that pine scent coming through. I would never guess this is a 10% beer either, which only adds to the overall greatness. It feels great in the mouth, light and smooth and easy to drink.     Overall, really exceptional beer that I didn’t think I would like. I was fortunate enough to load up on it this time around, I’m going to try to save it but it’ll be hard not to drink it all right away.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A bit let down from this. I don’t see this being a borderline world-class brew. Although it is very well balanced, Hopslam is missing something for me.     Still enjoyable. A brew that I will look to get my hands on in a lacking craft beer scene in South Dakota.    Revisited:    3/1/18. Delicious.

Pine & honey flavors up front; carmel & mild booze heat notes on the finish.     Clashing & cloying, this is bold but not very good. I've had my last.

I have crystal Spiegelau IPA glasses, but will leave the details to others much more qualified. ;-)  The shelf life is only 3 months. According to the brewer, it is still good after 3 months, but should no longer go by the name "Hopslam", since the taste will change.   I bought a case since this is allocated to stores in the area, and hard to come by. There will be no worry of it requiring a name change. All will be consumed within the next 2 weeks!  Canned 1/17/18.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Good head, creamy, 3 finger. Body is a gold amber with a strong dark orange mid body. Smell is of hops, pine, maple, floral, as well as tropical fruits such as pineapple, peach and even some serious sweet notes. Its hard to pinpoint these sweet notes of taste due to my virgin IPA tongue of only two years, but this one is giving off a strong essence of sweet. The strong booziness is there, but not as recognizable as you would surmise. The taste is definitely similar to the taste in exception to the sweetness. Fantastic IPA for its first round, would buy again most def and definitely deserves a second or even third try. Cheers!

Powerfully hoppy nose, sweetness already quite apparent. This ain't no NE IPA, ya'll.    I liked last year's release of Hopslam - but the funny thing to me is that I never really noticed just how sweet it is, and how present the honey is. It's a unique IPA - definitely not a NE and not a West Coast. It's mildly malty, nowhere on the level of a Founders Doom, but there's certainly some there in the mouth feel and taste. Again, it's sweet! Quite sweet. But, my girlfriend being the litmus test, the hops are still quite present - enough to be unpleasant to non-hops people.    This one isn't a beer that I want to drink multiples. I'll drink one and give up, or move on to something else. It's a good beer, but not one of those you take casually.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Love this beer! Drank out of an imperial pint glass and poured from the 1.32 gallon mini keg. Two finger head that settled down to a thin layer after a couple of sips. The lacing is crazy, this beer left the inside of my glass looking like it was covered in soap suds. On the nose I am getting a lot of sweet floral notes as well as a bit of piney resiney goodness. On mouthfeel I am getting a surprising creamy texture and the co2 hits at the end. As to taste this beer is perfectly balanced, full bodied with enough bitterness to cut the honey which I was a bit afraid might add a bit too much sweetness. I’m getting a lot of citrus stone fruit and pine on the finish. I must say this is an excellent beer and wish it was available year round.

The beer pours bright honey amber in color with sticky off white head. The head recedes to a thin ring and island leaving substantial lacing. The aroma is sweet caramel, citrus and pine. The taste is sweet caramel and honey flavors moving into sharp and clear piney bitterness. The booze in the aroma and taste comes out as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and somewhat dry in the finish. Overall, very good. All of these classics have a hard way to go compared to recent DDH bombs. Very enjoyable as an annual treat.

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 2.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 I give this a high rating only despite the hops, not because of them. The flavors are wonderful except for the hoppy pine and bitterness.     In my other reviews I've explained I do not like hoppy beers, 30 IBUs is probably the highest I go in terms of truly enjoying a beer. But this one manifests not only in the bitterness but also in a piney floral scent that reminds me pleasantly of walking, as I did many years ago as a child, under pine trees at my grandmother's home in Northville Michigan, and at many Michigan campgrounds my family visited.    I would sit and enjoy the shade and the scent of the needles, which was probably enhanced by crushing them as I walked and sat on them. So this beer brings me back to my childhood and teens, but I really couldn't drink more than a taste, which I had off the tap at a local bar.

Copper Orange pour, two finger head, Nice hops aroma, not overwhelming, balanced by pine, orange and malt. Hops much stronger / dominant in the taste area. Some balance with the pine, orange and malt, but the hops kicks all other tastes asses. Excellent firm mouth feel, bitter and pleasurable, texture firm, smooth going down. Nice kick you don't realize as you first begin drinking. Love this type of beer, this one is an excellent offering, glad I finally was able to snag with other cans anxiously waiting to join the first. Well done, Bells!

It's pretty high in alcohol which is fun sometimes but it's just slightly too bitter to experience for this kind of enjoyment. It's very well made from a great company and I do recommend it as something worthwhile to sip once in a while if you're a big fan of hops.

At this time the beer is probably not anywhere close to its full potential as I bought and drank this can months after the package date! I was just happy that the store still had cases of it so long after production.  The beer was definitely not skunked but may be significantly more mellowed than when fresh. Overall its hoppiness is on the dank and rich side, rather than the bright side, and I can't tell how much this is owing to its aging. I found it to be similar to Dogfish Head 90-minute IPA, with that same rich sweet malt backbone and balanced, full hop profile, only with the hops/spice/alcohol turned up a bit further.  So I won't go into a detailed review and will just say that I enjoyed it and I'd like to revisit it when it's fresh.

A half finger white foamy head appears and lasts for about a half minute. Light sticky foamy lacing appears. The smell has a ton of piney hops (holy hops, Batman! - could there be any more in the smell?), citrus, and some light honey (more so as the beer warms). Light caramel and a slight malty presence comes in later in the beer. The taste has a large amount of bitter and sweet between the previously mentioned flavors. A bit of spiciness comes through as the beer warms. On the palate, she sits about a medium with nothing sharp on the tongue. This has got to be one of the smoothest DIPA’s I’ve ever had. The 10 % ABV is hidden very well, as I almost feel like I could pound this all day, very sessionable. The aftertaste is piney and the finish is sticky and bitter. Overall, big wow from me as this is an exceptional beer for its style and for me.

It's practically a state holiday when Hopslam comes out each year! This beer is truly amazing. I don't say that without cause. The honey taste is sweet, but the underlying IPA bitterness really adds to the overall complexity. There's a series of events for your taste buds to experience with this one. This year's price was around $20.00 a 6 pack. I'm not a wealthy man, but I bought 8 where and when I could find them. It's worth a trip to their brewery, as well. They have several world class beers, and I don't see them slowing down. If you're truly a beer "snob", this one will put you on the edge of your seat! Enjoy!!

Very strong flavors upfront that stay even after you have drank the beer.    Overall, a pretty good beer with a nice citrus flavor that is expected from a double IPA. Though the booziness was a little strong towards the middle of the beer. Would recommend for future consumption.

Powerful hop aroma; plenty of fruit aromas: pineapple, pear, strawberries. The taste follows along the lines of the aroma with sweet fruit flavors; a noticeable alcohol presence that blends well with the fruit sweetness and hop bitterness. Heavy body with a soft, velvety quality; boozy warmth sitting beneath some fine residual sugars; an extraordinary blend of sweet and dry on the palate.    This is a vast improvement from my first experience in 2017. Damn, but this is a fine monster...    -------------------------------------------------    Unique can data: 17142 PKGD 13:50 012317 130655    Beautiful deep gold color; thick, sculpted, sticky head. Earthy scent; some old citrus rind and pine elements; some malt sweetness buried deep. Cereal grain malts with a big hop bitterness; faint esters. Heavy body; some mild coarseness to add bite to the feel; mostly dry finish.    So, a little old perhaps for an IPA...thought I had reviewed this a few weeks earlier, but apparently that review got lost in the ether...this is a pretty good IPA overall, it's just too bad that I chanced upon this lone six pack only a few weeks prior in late March (sitting atop numerous sixes of Bell's Expedition Stout). I would hope that a fresher version would deliver more of the aroma and taste that others in previous reviews have raved about. As I recall, my initial (lost) impressions and review were similar to this one. Well, sometimes you takes what you can gets...

The look is a slightly hazy pee yellow (yeah I went there) with not much head or lacing.  The smell is hops sweetness and booze.  The taste follows the character of the smell. Big juicy hops, sweetness from the honey and just enough heat to know you're drinking a double. Very addictive.  Mouthfeel is fine. Not too thin, but just thin enough to be somewhat refreshing.  Overall one of the better dipas I've tried. I think I'd put double crooked tree from dark horse slightly above it, but this comes in a close second. Give it a shot, its worth it.

Not fond of honey in beer, and always a bit doubtful of Simcoe, but the odd elements of this beer add up to a sweet but highly drinkable big DIPA.

The smell and flavor of this beer were absolutely delightful and a little more than ordinary. If I did have a complaint about this one was the flavor was great but nothing world class like I thought it would be but other than that I thought it went down smooth and relaxed and was easily 94/100 for me.

I used to love it, but something happened when Bells decided to can it vs bottle it. The current rendition has light head though does leave nice lacing. The golden color is slightly hazy but pretty clean.     I can't smell any notes off this can at all. Nothing.     The taste is mostly alcohol. Not much smoothness and not real drinkable. Pretty disappointing. I've now drank 4 of these out of six and am pretty sure that Bells has somehow messed up previously great beer.     Too bad.

But, when it's a good year, it is OUTSTANDING. The right blend of "fruity" hops and back end bitterness (tiny amount). This is a ridiculously smooth drinking IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.75 Maybe I'm missing something, but this is another beer that I'm not sure how it got rated in the BA250. I've only had the 2017 release, and have heard that prior years have been much better, so this is only the 2017 review.    Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter. Pours a golden, honeyish color that leans more amber, with a creamy white head. Slight haze to the body; the head stuck around and did lace nicely. From there, it went downhill. The nose was lacking & overbearingly sweet, especially for a DIPA. Coupled with lots of malt notes, a lot of the hop nose was overpowered.     The sweetness of the honey and how strong it came through is what shocked me most about this beer, to the point it's about all I could concentrate on. There's a flutterance of hop note that tries to compensate for the sweetness, but then the malt picks up on the tongue and the hop gets muddled. The overbearingness of the malt backbone and honey just didn't work in tandem with the Simcoe hop. Not enough bite to cut through the sweetness.     It finishes almost oily and lingers, but not in a way you'd like for a beer to linger. It's disappointing because Bell's puts out a lot of good product, but this, and especially for the price, is a huge miss in my book.

What I do respect is their balanced use of honey in this sucker - bittter, fresh (when fresh of course), great citrus-floral impact, good mouthfeel. Will never be my favorite, for sure, but glad I bought a sixer of it when it was out a few weeks ago. SOLID.  2019 version: at least .15 higher overall score, less cloying, less sweet. Well done!

Sadly, I am reviewing this year, as this beer was a real gem in the past. One of the interesting characteristics of Hopslam is the noticeable differences year to year. Unfortunately, I found the 2017 Hosplam to be astringent, boozy, and uninspiring. As usual, it is very hop forward, but only in bitterness. I found this year's Hopslam to be unbalanced and leaving an after taste of alcohol like a cheap Vodka. Thankfully, the beer does get better near the end, but hardly worth the wait or price. Temperature variations do not seem to provide any appreciable character. If I had to guess, I'd say mass production has led to the sad state of a beer that was once (for me, at the very least) so sought after.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 I have been fortunate enough to find Hopslam on tap for the past few years. Always tastes a little better to me from a tap. Tastes more like the Imperial IPA that it is, than when poured out of a can. But, I would never pass it up in any form when I'm lucky enough to find it.     As Imperial IPAs go, this one is probably the most Hop forward I've ever tasted. But it doesn't have too much of that grapefruit hop taste, that's so popular right now, but that I don't like. But it varies from year to year, as its a true craft beer that depends on a lot of variables, like timing when to add the next dose of hops. That said, this year's Hoplam was the best I've ever tasted! 5 snifters from a tap, and two 6 packs... But not all in one night   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 A great double IPA. Complex taste that comes from a great hop profile. Aromatic and pours with a nice head that lasts. Smoother rather than crisp, this beer is going g to seem a little boozy. But then again it's a 10% beer. Extremely good.

Two finger fluffy white head. Great retention and amazing lacing.     S: Strong notes of honey, strong floral hop presence. Good malt backbone as well.     T: WOW. Hopslam is an apt name. Rich and complex, perhaps the most complex DIPA I have had to date. (Including Pliny The Elder). Rich oils, Grapefruit, peppery notes. Then the Alcohol takes charge. Warms nicely. Finish is well balanced with the honey and malt.     F: Slightly syrupy but not too much, dulls a decent carbonation by a hair, light-medium body, slick from the hop oils. Warming and semi-dry.    O: Was pretty hyped for this beer and I have to say I was blown away. This was absolutely amazing. Wow. Well done Bell's.

Small amount of head that settles somewhat quickly. The taste follows, like drinking flowery citrus. Somewhat dry and oily, not overly so, a touch of malt lingers with tons of hops. The same flavors persist and not much changes. Not much evidence of alcohol heat. Not my favorite hop profile to be honest, and not very complex, it gets old quickly and you want something else.

Aroma (not overpowering) of pine and citrus, slightly dark straw color with small amount of foam. Taste is out of the park good; the honey tamps down the hops and that's the main taste, but again not overpowering some malt body and some alcohol. A dangerous 10 % beer, would not recommend having 2 or more at a time for sure! A wonderful example of a double IPA and for me, a top 10 commercially made best beer on earth! Round up score to 4.65!!!   
look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Enjoyed this freshly canned. Looks different from your stereotypical DIPA, pretty light bodied with a gold-like hue. Tastes much lighter than expected, most likely due to the honey undertones, and lacks the super hoppy taste that most DIPAs have. Surprisingly refreshing for a 10.5% beer and doesn't have the dry mouth feel to it that many heavy hitter DIPAs have. Overall this is a very good beer, but quite uncharacteristic of a DIPA. I'd certainly drink another one, even though I definitely prefer a West Coast style DIPA over this beer.

S - Kind of a sweet hoppy smell.  T - Getting some sweetness from the honey with some alcohol burn.  F - Slightly slick mouth feel, with medium carbonation.  O - I was looking forward to trying this beer, and was a little disappointment. It is a really nice beer, but I would have liked it better if the alcohol was hidden better. Still a very enjoyable beer.

The color of the beer quickly tells the story, with a golden honey brown appearance that indicates its nature. Though it leans a bit sweet and boozy, it is a good, well-balanced DIPA. It is just more a Ballast Point Dorado than a Heady Topper, and as a result not something I'd recommend if you are looking for a hop slam.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 From a 12 oz can (packaged on what appears to be January 23, 2017) into a tulip.    A-When I think about what an IPA (or IIPA) should look like, this is pretty close to what I have in mind. A tall, sticky off-white head is pillowy and dense. Retention is good and lacing is plentiful on the glass. The beer beneath is clear and light-golden-orange. A few bubbles creep up the center of the glass.    S-The aroma is intense and I like it. Lots of sweetness from the honey mixes with a pungent, powerful hop note. I sniff honey, bread crust, as well as orange zest, guava, lime, passionfruit, hints of pine and leaf, and a subtle herbal/dank note. Bitterness is high...this isn't a juice bomb, NE-style IPA.    T-The taste is similar to the smell with honey sweetness coming through clearly. The hops tend towards bitter and dank more than juicy and bright, but there is a good dose of pithy, zesty citrus fruitiness here. Alcohol is not concealed and there is a good bit of heat on the finish, along with a palate-scraping bitterness. The flavors on the finish suggest pepper and dandelion leaf.     M-The body is hefty with an active carbonation that fits the beer well. I also notice a heavy, oily hop residue.    O-This is one intense beer. I like the honey, which adds a lot of sweetness, but others may not. I don't know that I could drink more than one in a sitting, but at 10% ABV, I don't really need to. Lots of old-school IIPA flavor, which I enjoy, but it doesn't quite have the refinement of a Pliny.

From the 2017 batch either way.    A: Pours a slightly hazy, golden-orange color with a one inch, frothy, paper white head with good retention. Thick, white lacing throughout.    S: Aromas of citrus, tropical fruits, honey, and piney hops. Notes of grapefruit, orange, pineapple, mango, and passion fruit.    T: Starts off with grapefruit, orange, and honey followed by pineapple, papaya, and guava. Finishes with a slight lingering piney hop bitterness.    F: Medium bodied, smooth, and crisp with moderate carbonation. Slightly dry.    O: Overall, this is a great DIPA. Well balanced and the honey adds a nice sweet element, but not at an overwhelming level. Would definitely try this one again. Not sure it's quite at the level of it's current or previous hype, but a good beer none the less.

I get minimal honey flavor throughout, minimal bitterness.     This is a malt bomb, not the worst, but certainly nothing to get excited about

T: A Strong piney bitterness leads with notes of grapefruit and grapefruit pith, a floral hop in backgrpund. Strong honey sweetness (maybe a slight bit sweet) and a note of noticeable booze.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 First time enjoying this much hyped (but deserving) beer. Bought a 6-pack at Belmont Station in Portland, Oregon. I used my go to Avery 12 oz tulip glass to assess this beer.     Look: This beer pours a translucent golden, light orange color with a small white head that quickly dissipates. There are some light alcohol legs when swirled.    Aroma: Right up front you my nose gets smacked with pine and resin. There is some hint of grapefruit on the end followed by a very light wildflower/floral sweetness and caramel. As the beer warms up the boozy alcohol smell becomes much more apparent.     Taste: Again the taste is at first dominated by the pine with a very strong caramel malt backbone to support the somewhat aggressive bitterness of the hopping. As the beer warms up it becomes more sweet and boozy. Grapefruit and mango become more apparent as I continue to sip and there is definitely a discernible honey/wildflower sweetness that plays nicely with the hops. This beer actually becomes more enjoyable as it warms up and I am able to taste the honey much more near the end of the glass.     Feel: Low to moderate carbonation. Fairly light mouthfeel despite the strong caramel malt backbone. I think the honey thins this brew down a bit. Becomes increasingly thin as I drink.     Overall: I will echo the rest of the BA community when I say this is a world class IIPA. Wonderfully balanced with an assertive malt backbone that allows the hopping regiment shine through. This is also one of the few IPAs I have had that actually becomes more enjoyable throughout the drinking experience (and not just because of the 10% ABV). It is extremely drinkable for being 10%. I think the honey makes this beer even more enjoyable near the end of the glass. As the hop flavor dissipates the honey and floral tastes step up to the plate without coming off as cloying or overly sweet. First beer I've ever had from Bell's and I am very impressed.     I was able to try this beer on tap side by side with Pliny the Elder both on tap at Belmont Station last weekend which was not only highly enjoyable but also quite informative as to the differences between two world class IIPAs. This one seems to have a more assertive malt character that is enhanced by the honey possibly. Though I will say, Pliny may still have this one beat on hop character.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 I been looking forward to trying this brew for a long time, & until this week nobody ever had it in my area....so you can imagine my surprise when I walked into my local grocer & they had several sixers on the self! I HAD to get it!  So here goes, the ever popular & hyped Bell's Hopslam Ale!  Poured from a can into my favorite pint Pilsner glass, freshness date 1/16/17...2 weeks old! Does not get much fresher then that!!!  A: Slightly hazed amber with a towering 3 finger snow white head that lingers long time...beautiful.   S: Floral, piney, dank hops goodness, with a sweet undertone...very nice.   T: Follows the nose with the hops, then a solid malt backbone balances it out right away. Light honey sweetness comes in at the end offering its assistance in the balancing act, & combined with the malt gives a valiant effort...but the hops win!  M: Lingering hoppy goodness leaves things on the dry side, with a bit of the 10% ABV coming through.   O: Bell's Two Hearted Ale is my all time favorite IPA, so I had high expectations for this well hyped offering, especially since I'm a big fan of braggots. Did it live up? Sort of...it's VERY good, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't as blown away as all the hype said I would be, especially considering the price & scarcity of it. Still, an excellent brew that I recommend trying at least once if you got the cash & can find it.

L - Autumn color with a clear-hazy kind of thing going on. Moderate head that doesn't overstay its welcome.  S - Honey comes through first, along a good pine scent.   T - caramel malt backbone, sweet mouthful and a hop punch.  F - Medium bodied    Overall it's a delightful brew but it get so much hate because of the price point and the hype. One 6-pack a year seems to be enough for me. It's good but not the ultimate beer that the name comes to.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 On one hand, I really like Hopslam. It's an odd bird though, it kind of challenges your expectations. It goes down like it's 5-6% ABV, when really it's twice that. Not sure how they do it, very impressive. Some honey sweetness and hop bitterness that is melded together perfectly into a beer that is very craveable.    On the other hand, I would almost prefer it to be 5-6% than 10% ABV. If I'm going to drink something with that much alcohol, I don't want it to go down easy. I want it to have some intense, complex hops that I can sip slowly and appreciate. I don't want to finish a 10% ABV beer and feel like I want to slam 3 more.

However, it was a little boozier than what I was expecting. I know that it's a 10 percent beer but I feel like a Simtra has a less boozy taste than this.  I think this is a great beer, but I'm not sure I'm going to drive several miles out of my way again for this....

Good clarity, not seeing any floaties or sediment. Head recedes to thin film.    Smell is not overly aggressive but has good dose of grapefruit, orange, cereal, and yes, I pick up the honey.    First taste is pretty sweet up front coupled with some citrusy tartness and bitterness. Can really feel the balance of the cereal sweetness and piney, citrus flavors. Some of the honey flavor comes thru too and it adds to the sweetness. Some caramel too, but for so much sweetness, the orangey and grapefruit flavors are in tune with all of it. Zero alcohol detected.    Heavier side of medium bodied, a touch syrupy and mouth coating but only a slight bitter aftertaste. Carbonation is ample for the body.    I really wanted this beer about six years ago when first getting into craft beers but never scored and stopped actively searching it out. Finally able to get some now that it seems some of its luster has faded. But I can see why people like it so much. Extremely well balanced and the honey adds a touch not normally found in the newer DIPAs. Maybe a bit overpriced but probably not so much considering it sells out so fast.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 This is an outstanding beer. There's just a hair more honey sweetness than I like in my IPA, but the citrus and piney tones balance it nicely. It really is a world class IPA. Enjoying tonight on draught in MI, home of Bells.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours a copper orange color with about two fingers of white head that clings a little to the glass. Smells of malts, honey, floral notes, and citrus. Tastes of delicious. Very smooth, just a little hop bite to it, heavily citrus flavors, orange, mango, a little pine at the end, and a solid malt backbone to bring it all together. Well balanced brew. A little pricey for a six pack, okay maybe a lot pricey, but worth it.

The taste is very very smooth, this is an IPA that I can really get into, very smooth hops and even pine bite, just a really well balance beer with nothing over the top all just working perfectly. I have to say this is one of my favorite IPA so far, just smooth and well balanced. The finish is mild and clean, very pleasing tastes and leaves you wanting another sip. Very nice beer.

It's solid to me mainly because it's a 10%er that doesn't lose much of its softness to the alcohol. It's big without being overwhelming. Awesome brew.

For the ABV this beer is very light on hops compared to other IPAs. The honey and malt add a sweet aftertaste for a very good and complex beer. Definitely worth a try for any beer lover.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Clear golden bronze with three fingers of off-white head. Leaves heavy lacing.     Piney, resiny goodness in the aroma when first cracked open, followed by a honey graham sweetness that has a relatively dry, powdery finish. Just a kiss of alcohol behind.     The taste has some of that same dry sweetness up front with a touch of tropical fruit added to the mix. There's clear alcohol throughout, with a mellow piney hop bitterness on the backend that slowly sneaks up on you.    Medium bodied, somewhat chewy, with a fairly strong astringency from the alcohol.     There's a lot going on in this one. Maybe a bit overhyped, but still excellent.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 12 oz can package date 01/14/17,into a Cigar City spiegelau IPA glass.    Thick,creamy,slightly off white colored head,that stands just under 2 fingers tall.Beautiful lacing that sticks to the side of the glass.Hazy dark gold in color,with an almost orange hue.Medium clarity.Medium carbonation    On the nose I get citrus fruit notes,mango and grapefruit,along with piney hops,and some earthy malts.Maybe it's just me but I think I am getting some caramel,probably from the malts.    On the palate I get mostly bitter piney hops up front,backed by some citrus and some sweet malts on the back end to balance it out.Also getting some spices and floral flavors in the middle.    The body is on the border of thin,and medium with a good dose of oxidation on the tongue.Dry finish with a slightly chalky mouth feel.    This is a very good IPA citrus and pine on the nose,bitter hops on the palate,nice mouth feel.Not much to complain about on this one.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Pours a dark gold, nearly amber, with a thick creamy head. The head was quite large in size, but fell quickly to form a thin white cap, slightly thicker at the edges. lacing is everywhere with this one. Completely clear, with a small amount of carbonation rising to the top. As always I get tropical fruit with these DIPAs, but the addition of honey makes this a real treat. I get undertones of grass, it's floral, piney, and bitter to go along with the fruit.    I get very little of the fruit flavors the nose promised. Instead I get heaps of pine, fresh cut grass, resin. This is the first beer I can truly call dank. I get hints of grapefruit at the beginning, and then right at the tail end, along with the honey sweetness. Right in the middle of the beer, it reminds you that it's not something to ignore, with a huge alcohol bite to accent and strengthen the piney flavors.    The beer is not as dry as I'd heard, with the honey helping keep the beer very drinkable. It's still very bitter, with the honey only there to help cut down on the bite. It's ABV is also not hidden at all, and a long with the high amount of carbonation I felt in the mouth, this beer was very light and thin bodied, but never in flavor. While IPA still isn't one of my favorite styles, I am glad I was able to try this giant of the craft world. I would buy again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Canned 1/11/2017. Poured into snifter glass. It pours hazy golden-amber with one full finger of foamy, bright-white head and lacing with nice retention. It smells of sweet malt, honey, peach, and pine. The taste is a wonderful blend of biscuit, sweet malt, bitter hops, honey, and sweet fruit. Rather than one taste at a time, it seems to all happen at once. It's absolutely delicious! This ale is medium-bodied with with a rather thick, creamy feel, with pleasant carbonation, and a punchy 10% ABV that gives it substance. Overall, this is superb DIPA, equally appropriate for casual drinking or paired with a good meal. It absolutely deserves its stellar reputation and world-class rating BA rating.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This classic pours a golden orange color with a two finger head. Smell and taste are citrus, honey, a little pine, & sweet malt. Everything melds together well for a nice smooth double, easy drinking for 10%.

Completely hidden (especially for 10%).  Slightly more viscous than anticipated, a tad but much for the style. While the booziness was hidden from the taste, you certainly can feel it warming on the backend.  Overall great stuff, worth seeking out.

The aroma is stone fruit, butterscotch, caramel malt, and orange zest. Citrus, fruit, and floral notes in the flavor, along with some sweetness from the honey and malt. Grapefruit and some herbal qualities kick in after the initial fruit taste. A bit of hops bitterness in the aftertaste, along with some alcohol vapor. A very good beer overall.

Aroma is bitter hop, pine, resin, and a slight sock hint.  Flavors are citrus: lemon, tangerine, grapefruit, and bitterness. No booze heat.  Mouthfeel is crisp and clean and slightly dry with a bitterness left behind. Medium to high carbonation.  My pallette has definitely changed; this is easier to drink than I recall. Easy drinking and no booze heat make for a dangerous combination. Well done.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a Teku. A clear amber-orange color with a resilient and lasting foamy white head. The aroma was full of pine, earthy notes, oranges, and muted bready malt. This was very drinkable for such a big beer - citrus up front with a nice mix of dank, resiny flavor and pine needles. The malt is there and the slight sweetness balances against the warming on the finish.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Just purchased a couple of sixers from Green's in ATL for $35 and change. Thankfully they had it in stock after the other two big stores sold out. I was debating whether or not to buy some this year. In Illinois one can buy as much as one wants,but here in GA one is limited to a six.I took my Boo with me, so she could buy one for me. A few years ago The Slam was special, but now with the proliferation of DIPA's it's just OK. It's extremely balanced and crushable for 10% ABV, but it's not what it's used to be for my tainted buds. I've been ageing them regardless of what the brewer suggests. Bell's still kicks ass.

To be fair, I've not had other years variations.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Golden peach color.    Aroma of pear, Apple, honey, some other fruity esters, biscuit malt, and mosaic.    Flavor is otherworldly. I don't know how to describe it. So smooth yet the bitterness is still there. Hints of lemon rind, apple, and honey. Bread on the aftertaste.    Slightly hot with booze, medium bodied, creamy finish.    Overall hopslam is the expedition of IPA's. I'm not a hop head so I wouldn't pay the $18 a six pack - but it's amazing in its own right.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pours a nice clear golden orange, produces as a small off white head that fades away leaving a ring and a nicely laced glass.  Honey is noticeable as you pour, then some flowery hops with a hint of citrus.  Fairly sweet upfront, the honey seems to stay with this.  Surprisingly creamy and smooth.  I guess I was expecting more of a hop bomb here, but this proved to be a very smooth beer. It's boozy, but easy to to drink. This is one of those beers where I kick up the ratings as I drank it. An excellent DIPA.

Everything about this beer is great. From its hazy yellow-orange glow and creamy head to its honeyed hop flavor, nothing is overpowering and the flavors just meld together perfectly. Its sweetness from the honey perfectly balances the hops that hit you in the face. I'm not a big fan of hops for the sake of hops, but this brew just sings in harmony with all of the other flavors.    The only downside is that it is seasonal and must be had fresh. Other than that, get it if you can and savor it.

Feel: Full Bodied creamy. Great carbonation.    Overall: I had this beer for the first time last year and loved it but since then I've drank a lot of great beer and this just isn't the same to me anymore. this is a good beer but just doesn't hold up to the other great IPA's and double IPA's that are out there now. It's a really nice beer upfront and in the middle but the finish is a bit harsh the alchool is pretty noticeable and I'm not a fan of that. This is a good beer but not a world class one.
