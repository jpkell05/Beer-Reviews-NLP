look: 3.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 Complex and clean, Two Hearted is a an IPA that we feel is mostly enjoyed by hopheads and beer connoisseurs. It is rather unassuming and has mostly subtle tastes, leading to its lower rating. However, its still a beer that we would enjoy given the opportunity.

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Picked up from harris teeter because of so many good things ive heard about it.  Look- a beautiful dark, hazy golden brown color with about a finger of head that becomes suds in a few minutes   Smell- I get sweet woodiness with berry and fruit mixed in. So good they could make candles out of this.  Taste- more floral than the smell, but the fruitiness still comes in strong with a nice hoppy bitterness on the finish.   Feel- on the lighter end of thick with a smooth finish. Could easily drink a few on a cold night in or on a summer patio  Overall- one of the best ipa’s i’ve tasted. Flavorful without being offensive, and would pair nicely with a good burger or even a big steak. If you can find a 6 pack, buy it.

After having a couple, I appreciate the grapefruit smell and the alcohoI kick. I think this would be an excellent beer to have on a warm summer evening enjoying time with friends..

Look was a very nice orangey-amber color, with one to two fingers of head. Head dissipates, but leaves nice lacing.  Smell of grapefruit, pine.  Tasted awesome of course; excellent hop and malt flavors, very well balanced, decent bitterness.  Feel was good, smooth, very easy drinking; again great balance between citrus hop flavors and malts.  Overall, excellent IPA that will always be in my fridge. There is a reason why this is a top-rated beer year-in, year-out!

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a bottle at 45 degrees,    Look - Pours a beautiful, hazy dark amber with a good amount of head  Smell - Very piney and earthy w/ floral with abounding hop aromas.  Taste - A burst of citrus, pineapple and floral hop flavor with a strong bitter yet appropriate bready malty finish to perfectly round out the taste.  Feel - The high carbonation allows this beer to have a strong mouthfeel that is not too thick or thin. Not too oily, but respectively heavy enough.  Overall - A very well made balanced IPA that is from Trader Joe's. I will be comparing it to some of my other favorite IPAs to compare, but this one competes with the best.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 I have had lots and lots of different IPA but this one stands out. Has a large malt backbone, with piney citrus notes that linger. Pretty sticky and resiny. Delectable, the quaff is about as good as it gets...I was trying to find a great IPA that wasn't juicy style. As that is what has dominated my choices for the last few months. IPA is all I drink but who cares? I just mention it because i'm pretty particular about what I look in a IPA as I feel the style has a lot of crap on the market. However, this one is great. My mother who hates most IPA can actually drink this one and that says a lot to me. Other than that, love the hops in this, love the beer in general. Very much look forward to having this on tap.

Smell is packed full of citrus and pine with a hint of malt sweetness and spice. Taste is citrusy with grapefruit and lemon with a pronounced hoppiness from the Centennial hops. A slight spice characteristic is noted up front while the toasty/cookie malt complements the overall flavor.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 12 oz can poured into a pint glass.  Golden-amber in appearance, clear, soft off-white lasting head.  Floral, wood smell. Not overpowering. Very inviting.  Citrus, floral, wood, malt, spice and pine resin for flavor. Slight bitter finish.  Medium body, soft, good mouthfeel, balanced with a little bitter edge.  Overall, a complex tasting, soft, balanced IPA that I also find to be - with the floral, citrus, and wood notes with a significant malt body - to be exceptionally tasty. Tastes like a cedar plank lined with vanilla white flowers.

(Shelf life: 6 months) opened on 11/26/18     Pours out looking Amber and gold, tight, creamy and frothy suds, off white color. Amazing retention. Sticky-icky lacing left overs.    The smell of the 100% Cenntenial hops dominates the nose. Super sweet & fruity, strawberry pie, creamy tropical pineapple and hearty, herbalized earthy tones make for a very unique and bold aroma. Pretty sure the amber-style malt brings in more honey style sweetness in a subtle way.    This comes across as a much more "balanced" west coast style IPA in the flavor profile overall. Earthy, citrus, some laid-back pineapple and tropical fruit flavors from the Cenntenial-only hops. Herbal and hearty effects deep down with a mild but dry hoppy finish. The malt is medium to full, Amber sweetness of honey soaked dark bread does provide a classic, strong backbone for some old-school balance.     I cannot believe it's taken me this long to review such a classic IPA. A friend purchased it today, and I'm so glad he did.

The flavor was generally bittersweet thanks to a good malt flavoring. Medium body; good balance of creaminess and carbonation. Overall, a good, solid IPA.

Pours a very deep gold producing 2 fingers of off-white, moderately lasting head that leaves behind unbelievable rings, streaks and webs of clumpy lace. Aroma is citrus and floral hops somewhat balanced with a nice sweet malt. Taste is citrus, sweet malts, caramel, pine and pepper (in that order). A nice dry finish, the taste is also well balanced.

Ton of sticky lacing.    Smell:  Floral. Oranges.     Taste:  Grapefruit. Slightly pungent. Bitter rind. Dank. Sweet pine.    Feel:  Seltzer crisp. Medium body.    Overall:  This is a fine beer. It is not the best American IPA I’ve had, but up there. The bitter citrus rind bite lingers a little longer than I’d like, especially now that I’ve tried “New England” IPAs like Toppling Goliath’s Pompeii. This is a solid 4. Depending on the competition, I'd be open to getting this again.

look: 3.75 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.25 Was recommended by a midwestern pal, Finally found some cans in CT. Pours a nice clear, clean looking amber. Thin, fine head. Aroma is simply malt, sweet . Taste is much the same, some caramel, finishing with some moderate bitterness. Flavoring Hops are not shining through. Overall, its a bit plain. I have to imagine its better closer to the source. I like the style generally but its lacking some of the funk and hop presence i expect in every ipa, regardless of style. In the current “nuclear arms race” of ipa hopping, this beer lags behind... But maybe that holds appeal for some.

Even drinking this beer out of a cardboard coffee cup ( stuck in a hotel room) it really hits you in the nose. The centennial hops are fantastic. A little bit of a excessive bitter aftertaste. But very very enjoyable.    Update: I’ve upgraded to a plastic cup I found in the lobby.   I’m a big IPA guy, and this beer is world class.

Two Hearted is a very nice brew and something I would have on hand for friends and ME to drink.

From the look, to the smell, to the taste, it is one of my personal favorites. Not to mention Bells is a great brewery overall. For sure in my top 10 favorites. A great balance of bitterness and "fruityness" that really fits the mood from just hanging out on the porch to watching a good band perform. Nothing overpowering, yet incredibly full flavored.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 12-oz. bottle poured into a 16-oz. mug. A moderate pour creates a finger sized frothy white head which quickly fades to a ring. Lots of lacing.  Golden amber slightly cloudy, appears yellow in front of light.  Smell features piney hops and abundant malt.  Taste follows; semi-dry and bitter at first with a malty semi sweet middle and apricot flavor. The finish is spicy and dry with a lingering hop bite. Alcohol is noticeable and peppery.  Medium-light body with low carbonation, even throughout the palate.   Malty, spicy and well hopped, a smooth drink despite the spice.

Not very intense, but nice aromas of biscuity malt, grapefruit, orange peel and a hint of pine in the nose. Taste follows suit, with a very nice balance of biscuity, slightly caramelly malt and lightly resinous citrus hops. Notes of grapefruit, orange peel and pine. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some light pine lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. Classic old school IPA with a certain West Coast accent to it. Quite nice for what it is and really well-balanced.

Some light lacing during drinking. Aroma is of grassy & fruity hops with some sour malt blended in. Taste is better as I was expecting too much sour malt after the aroma. An even blend of mild citrus, grassy hops, sweet caramel malts and just a touch of pine. Grapefruit lingers on the finish. Mouthfeel is full & quite smooth & is perhaps the best part of this beer. In the end, a solid IPA I've been wanting to try which doesn't strike me as something I'll need to seek out, but would gladly have again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 On tap at the Maryland Mallet Smokehouse and Pub in Westminster, MD. Perfectly golden to light amber in the glass, with a nice head of foam and tiny bubbles rising inside. Piney hops in the nose, with a hint of biscuity sweetness on the tongue, follwed by a very well balanced malt body and spicy pine and citrus. A slight bitterness rounds out the flavor for one of the best IPAs out there, IMHO. It paired well with the BBQ and the seafood on the table, too. Very nice!

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Somewhat dark orange color that is slightly hazy with a 2 finger silky head. Fruity aroma with some malt peeking through.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours a hazy but shimmering copper gold with a fine head and excellent creamy lacing. A super start.    The aroma is inviting with the only drawback being that it is subdued. A well-balanced presentation of malts countered with ruby-red grapefruit and pine resin. Clean and the paragon of an IPA, I just wish there was more of what is a good smell.    The flavor is everything that one could want in an IPA. There is a strong malt spine that helps provide a "base" for a wide-ranging and balanced bitter counterpoint that is equal parts citrus (grapefruit) and evergreen. Undeniably hoppy and bitter, yet (thankfully) not trying to win an IBU prize. The word here is "balance" and it's spectacular.     The bitterness, carbonation, and a hint of booze all combine for a drying crisp finish that makes this very drinkable.     I can't believe that I've delayed this long in trying and reviewing this brew. The IPA style became "worn out" for me a couple of years ago, but I've returned to try it anew. This brew is an excellent representation of the style. Undeniably hoppy and bitter, but well balanced and restrained on that point.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Dated 6/21/18 on the bottom of the can, packaged 2.5 weeks ago.    Pours a slighty cloudy darker orange-amber with two fingers of creamy off-white head. Nose starts off with a sweet ruby grapefruit and moves in to lemonade, a potpourri of florals (I get jasmine and lavender), pine sap, dark fruit that leans towards blackberry and sweet Portuguese bread malt. Taste brings in another dose of that dark fruit I got on the nose, balanced well with the sugary malt. Along with the notes of the nose, I also get some earthiness, slight spiciness and hop candy notes. Body is a sticky, yet smooth medium with fine streaming carbonation. Medium sweetness, low drying, medium-low bitterness. It's worth noting the head on this brew stuck around for the whole tasting and when it got a little low, a small swirl of the glass revitalized it fully. Overall, it's one of those wonderful East meets West coast brews that just hit the right spot, balancing hops and malt perfectly. I'll definitely be picking this up often now that it's here in MA.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Excited to try this for the first time. It didn't disappoint. Poured from a tallboy dated 5-30-18 (a tad over a month old) into a Tumbledown tulip glass. Golden/copper, nice lacing, not a heckuva lot of aroma. From the first sip, a beautifully balanced IPA. The 7% abv hits my sweet spot - strong enough to defend itself, but very drinkable.

Off white head with very nice retention and some sticky lacing. Beautiful.    S: Light citrus and pine with some spices. Malty. Not a strong aroma but enough comes through to enjoy.    T/M: Spicy. Light pine and citrus. Some bitterness. Sticky/Syrup. Malts. More hops. Light carbonation feel. Alcohol burn comes through a bit. Pretty smooth with a slight bittery finish and a little linger of alcohol. Has a distinct taste which is always a plus.    O: Great well balanced classic IPA. On the border of being a sipper. None of the ingredients pop but are easy to distinguish. Not sure this can compete with the current IPA scene. Great price.     Cheers!!

look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3 The BASIC B*tch of IPAs.    US-05 tasting in yeast, basic 1 dimensional hop profile, basic body, just basic. I feel $12 a 4 pack is a bit steep. Perhaps a 6pack for that price? Or even a 6pack of pints to compete with Swamis? Other than that, nothing special stuckout for me to keep buying. It's a one dimensional AIPA that is good, but I'll stick to Swamis.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Very new to my area. My first time drinking a Bells beer.    Semi-cloudy golden color with a 4F head. good head retention.    Mostly malty, piney-sweet aroma. Not very pronounced.    Light body, sticky MF ( I like this in an IPA) more malt forward than other IPAs.    Citrus, pine, not too pronounced , but good.    Overall- solid IPA. I wasn't wowed. We have a lot of excellent beers in my area. This is a classic, but the citrus is not as pronounced as other beers in the same style. I do like the sticky, more malt forward drinkability of the beer.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 New to the MA area so picked up my first sixer. Aroma is subtle, more grain than hops. Pours a golden amber color with about 1/2" head, not a lot of lacing. This reminds me of an English style ale, very nicely balanced - solid malt backbonethat's not overly sweet with a subdued hoppiness. Carbonation is somewhat subdued as well but the end result is an easily drinkable, world class beer. Subtle bitterness lingers on the palate but never overpowers. Beer that tastes like beer should, no juicy, mango, citrus nonsense going on here. Very nice, I"d buy this again in a heartbeat.

Some caramel maltiness in there as well    T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the floral and fruity hops and then goes into a mix of caramel and earthy/grassy notes. Bitterness is balanced very well. Finishes with lingering caramel and floral notes    M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation    O: A very good IPA that is extremely well balanced and easy to drink. Deceptively hoppy

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 So in my glass is the famous Two Hearted IPA. It looks good, potent dark sun yellow, lightly hazy, with a great very foamy and rocky white head, highly carbonated in appearance. Acute citrusy C-hops nose, very flowery, sweet, sour, hints at lemon pie, lilac (orval anyone?), grapefruit, grass. Solid toasty/cookie malt attack early like a good pils, quickly complemented by the direct floral and citrusy hops. Great flavor development for an IPA, but you know where they're from, hophead's neck of the wood and always lacking a touch of "multidimensionality". Tremendous velvety texture, less carbonated than anticipated. Clean and long oily bitter finish. Quite good, but top 100 in the world? I think not. Maybe a top 10 IPA though.

Hop forward but with a substantial malt contribution.

I may wonder off , but I always come back to this beer.

Got it from a can, so it'll have to do.    L: Very slightly cloudy in a bronze, copper like color.   S: Scents of nature. Like walking through a pine tree forest during the autumn season, if I had a caramel incense poking out of my pocket.  T: The taste is feint of trees and caramel, maybe even slight molasses?  F: It's dry at the beginning, due to the hoppiness, but smooths itself out.    Overall, the beer reminds me of what it would be like if a new partner invited you over to their house, watch a World War II documentary, and wondering why. It was a great night, but leaves a bit more to be desired. I've had better IPAs, but this is certainly good.

This citrus doesn't taste artificial whatsoever, which I've found to be unfortunately prevalent with ales of this nature. The alcohol content actually feels like a contributing ingredient rather than an obligatory addition. Not to mention, the smell is phenomenal. My only gripe is that the mouth feel is a bit syrupy and doesn't necessarily meld well with the other characteristics. Regardless, this it perfect outlier to throw into a session.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a medium amber color with some haze. Head is off white with excellent retention and great lacing. Very little carbonation is visible.  The nose is hoppy and fruity. Lots of citrus and just a bit of pine bitterness.  Excellent balance between the malts and hops. Sweet type caramel up front then comes in with some tropical hops bitterness.  Mouth feel is light, smooth and refreshing. Carbonation is crisp.

Extremely well balanced, smooth mouthfeel with nice carbonation. Mild lingering bitterness. Forced to I could drink this wonderful IPA every day.

I always have a six pack lined up in my fridge, even though I am constantly trying out the latest and greatest offerings from the local michigan craft brews. The beer itself is very sweet on the front end and a bitter tongue punch to finish. In my opinion this beer tastes more closely to a double IPA just slightly less sweet. Also not that it matters but the color of the beer is a nice burnt orange/ deep amber color.

This is a good mellow IPA with moderate bitterness. I've had it before on occasion and I'm sure I'll have it again.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Can from Whole Foods. Medium amber/golden with nice fluffy head. Looks great. Aroma is malty, bready, a hint of hops. Taste brings the hops forward, but this is a not big hoppy IPA, so they support the malt bill, working with it. very well rounded, smooth, nice textures. Worthy of its reputation. Been seeking this for a while.

I still like it, but having tried many IPAs over the past few years, it does not stand out as it once did. It’s a great beer and I always have some in my fridge, but have gravitated toward some other IPAs that are more hop forward and more bold in terms of citrus, pine and other fruits.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 16oz beer that was canned on 2/28/18 and poured into a pint glass. There are strong notes of hops, pine, grapefruit, and a little malt. The beer is a darker orange (darker than most American IPA's out there) but, not too dark. The beer had almost no head and left a nice lacing as the beer was drank further down the glass. Taste is an explosion of flavor, for me this is THE IPA. Grapefruit flavors with a notes of tropical fruit are what I taste. The feel of this beer is perfect, not too carbonated but, just carbonated enough to "pierce your tongue" as they say. Overall this is my favorite IPA, excellent!

Two hearted has always been close to my heart since trying it on its inaugral run. I had always thought of it as the beer that changed beers, and years ago I would have given it close to a 5/5! However, since then, IPA's have changed and yes it is still a staple of IPA's, it is not my "go-to". It looks gorgeous poured, and smells/feels beautiful as well. The taste hangs bitter, and I am tasting between a local pour, bottle, and a

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 I’ve finally developed a taste for IPA’s over the years, but still I’m pretty selective (definitely more of a stout guy). That being said, I must rank this as about the best IPA, and for that matter, one of the best quality beers in general, that I’ve had. Poured a nice goldish and orangish, with about a finger width head, that although most was gone in 5 minuets, remained a thin layer the duration, which laced nicely. Smell was definitely citrus and taste followed. Medium carbonation mouthfeel. Hoppy enough to be an IPA, but not so overwhelming that it takes the enjoyment away. I’ve heard this is a world class beer, I now see why. Good stuff!

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Hands down my favorite beer, and in my favorite style, the West Coast IPA. Love this stuff. Pours golden/Amber in color, light white head, laces the glass well. Head retires into little clusters of foam typical of hoppy ales. Smells strongly of pine and grapefruit.   Mouthfeel is great, perfectly carbonated and goes down very smooth. Malt presence is there, bready with a light touch of sweetness, but not out front, typical of style.   Big hop forward taste, bitter citrus flavors dominate, but not enough to seem overwhelming or dry out the palate. Best West Coast IPA on the market IMO.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4 Smooth, easy to drink, very enjoyable feel. A very pretty cloudy amber, but nothing special to look at. The flavor doesn't blow me away by any means, being not much more than a more balanced IPA, but the real pleasure is how it feels to drink it.

Full bodied, not overly creamy but at times it does have that creamy mouthfeel to it. A very good beer that has a little bit of everything from malt sweetness, floral, earth and pine as well as citrus.

For me personally, it's a different IPA than your traditional west coast IPAs. It's got a nice sweet smell on the nose, almost like a sweet citrusy smell. Also a really nice floral aroma and a touch of pine. This is a very unique IPA. If you haven't tried this yet, try it! If you like IPAs, you definitely won't be disappointed. Make sure it's fresh though!

The beer pours slightly hazy light amber with sticky off white head. Retention and lacing are above average. The aroma is citrus and pine. The taste is a lovely balance of caramel malt and citrus & pine from the centennial hops. Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied, well carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. There is a little sticky hop oil and caramel finish that is again: balanced. Overall, excellent. The hardest thing about reviewing this beer is slowing down enough to take some notes. If you enjoy a balanced IPA and find this fresh, get some.

This brew pours out a shade akin to golden brown or amber. Thick 2 finger thick tan head on this beaut. Nose is of citrus and ripe fruit,perhaps some grapefruit.     Tastes exactly how it smells. Probably the only beer i've ever had that does this to a T. Body is medium not too dry. alcohol taste is superbly hidden. Two hearted is a staple in my fridge and always will be.     Do yourself a huge favor and try some today. Cheers.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured hard into a frosted pilsner glass. Beautiful two fingered head. Color is a light hazy yellow orange. Nice lacing while drinking. Smell is light, citrus and hops. Taste is very well balanced and somewhat complex. Strong hops, but not bitter. Later taste is mild malt and ripe fruit. Feel is medium with ample carbonation that entices the taste buds. This is an excellent AIPA.

Aroma of ripe fruit, some hops and malt. Lovely smell.  Taste: Medium hoppy bitterness, some malt. I've had this beer on draft and it blew me away. Unfortunately, didn't get that feeling this time. Maybe the high expectations were disappointed.  Mouthfeel: a good bit of bitterness. OK, not great.

look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 I know my California roots and tastes make me biased, but I really didn't enjoy this IPA all that much, especially since it is one of the most decorated beers around today. It's a heavier IPA, with a lot of foam. It smelled like malt with a hint of fruit which I enjoyed. I felt like the taste was bland, especially compared to the smell. I thought my poor review of this beer was an abnormality until my friend from Texas and my brother in New Jersey told me they too were underwhelmed with this beer. Simply put I would not buy this beer again.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Poured into a tulip glass & had a nice pale amber look. Very nice citrus smell & very well balanced. It has a more malt taste compared to my favorite IPA beers & I do find the hops lacking. This is definitely a personal preference & probably my own fault for ruining my taste buds with years of smokeless tobacco. Still one of my favorite IPA beers around lunch time but prefer a little more hops around dinner.

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours: Into my mouth from a 16oz can.   Smells: Fantastic, notes of citrus especially mild grapefruit.   Taste: Very good, smell of grapefruit does not survive the tastebuds. Very smooth and drinkable for an IPA. High ABV for an IPA at 7.0%.   Feel: light body. Again, very drinkable.     I’d get this one again.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Pours a beautiful burnt gold with a rocky two finger head that lasts forever and leaves plenty of lovely lace. Smells of citrus, pine resin and a touch of pineapple and orange zest. Taste follows nose with fresh citrus and a palate smacking bitterness but with a nice balance of malt backbone. Medium bodied with a long tasty finish. Refreshing, delicious, near perfect.

I will say for all of the attributes, it is a very well balanced IPA in every regard, enjoyable while you are drinking. For me, it's not really memorable or something that I would go out of my to find to have again.    Look: Basic Pale Ale, nice color. The ones that were poured for me from the tap were a little hazy. Nice head in the glass.  Smell: Nice and citrusy, not overwhelming.  Taste: Dry, well balanced, but not as much malt in the background as I come to expect from the reputation.  Feel: Nothing remarkable, felt like an IPA, maybe a touch thin.  Overall: A good representation of the style, I would drink again.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Two Hearted Ale brewed by Bell's Brewery, Inc., with an ABV of 7.00% This American IPA pours out a deep golden amber color with a nice thick white head. The head to this brew sticks around. There is a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness, earthy grains and malts. This brew has the look and smell of most American IPA's on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You first pick up on the Hoppy bitterness, the a nice smoothness of earthy grains and malts. There is also a nice slight sweetness at the end note of this brew. Two hearted Ale , has a lot going on in it. The body of this American IPA is a solid medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a real nice balance to it. This is one of the more enjoyable IPA's I have had in awhile. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.00% ABV in this brew,it is just that smooth. I can't get over how smooth this brew goes down. This brew would go nice with dinner. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Hoppy, Smooth, Clean, and Refreshing. Overall I'm Two Hearted Ale, a 4.50 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Bell's Brewery, Inc., did a super nice job with this American IPA.

Smells mainly of grapefruit and piney and mildly grassy hops; orange, pineapple, overall smells sweet and floral.    Blatant grapefruit rushes the mouth with a slight lemon tartness that supplements with it, orange citrus flavor present as well. Somewhat bitter piney taste and aftertaste. Smooth, floaty feeling.

The aftertaste has more of the bitterness than in the drinking of the beer. It is in the mid price range of IPAs at my bottle shop, which makes me feel like I am getting a great beer at a good price.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Crisp finish. Great Hops profile. Easy drinker with amazing aroma and flavor. No harsh aftertaste. 
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Bottle packaged 4 weeks ago. Copper color with large soapy off white head. Nose is white bread, tropical fruit, sweet caramel malts. Taste follows the nose, also hoppy and piney. A bit chewy but refreshing. Great balanced IPA. I recommend this if you can get it.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Bought at Kroger's Swift Creek Midlothian. Bottling date is on the back label - 8/24/17! A little over 2 weeks old AMAZING FIND at this local grocery store! Hopefully it wasn't stored in hot warehouse! Deep gold pour with immediate hop aromas! Excellent balance between the malt and hops with low amount of bitterness! Very crushable and TASTY! Beautifully made beer! I can now taste the reason this has always been a standard bearer for IPA's! I could see this being drank throughout the year (But spring and summer is best for me!) Thanks Bell's! Find and drink amazing beers! SEH P.S. Price point for this beer is great @ $1.75 a bottle!!!! What a break from spending $4 - $6 a can/bottle of local craft beers nowadays!! AHHH!

The hops finish for quite a while on my palate which is nice. I get a bit of bitter lemongrass and grains. It's a beautiful color, nice golden with some haze. I get lots of malt on this, it's sort of heavy and it is filling. Great for colder weather. The feel makes you want another sip though. I think it could possibly pass for a Pale Ale but who really cares? It's good,worth drinking and I really like it.

Crisp, with a decent amount of carbonation. A bit more of a full drinking experience, something more to be contemplated than slugged back  O: Actually surprisingly good and complex IPA, though not overtly challenging. Haven't had much from these guys but can dig it for sure. Definitely will be something of a mainstay in the near future, great IPA

The taste is more than redeeming with a great balance of malt and hoppiness, leaning mostly to tropical and citrus notes attributed to the Centennial hops.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 L -- Pours a moderately hazed pale golden color with a two-finger cream-colored head produced with aerated pour. Decent retention and good lacing  S -- Pretty big malt, citrus, and floral presence, with a faint skunkiness and sweet earthiness taking up the rear  T -- Lots of herbaceous, earthy, and grassy flavors. Some caramely sweetness from the malts, and there's a faint citrus note in the background that I'm just barely picking up on. Quite bitter  F -- Medium+ mouthfeel, medium carb. Flavors are too skewed towards earthen hoppy bitterness and the finish is a little puckering  O -- Reminds me a lot of Racer 5 IPA, and like with Racer 5 I found this brew to be too one-dimensional in its earthen bitterness and only slight floral and citrus presence to offset the heavy malting going on    72/100

Overall, this really is a great, tasty beer. It is a bit heavy for the style, but in terms of aroma and flavor - it's very good.

Aroma is sweet citrus, malt, not screaming IPA, and fairly muted. The taste is sweet malt up front, followed by a medium bitterness that lingers, citrusy, grainy, somewhat juicy mouthfeel. Not really sure what all the fuss on this beer is, was expecting so much more.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Serving: 12 oz bottle ("PKG 07/26/17") poured into a shaker pint.    Appearance: Clear, pale gold with a tall, lush, frothy head of white foam and spotty lace.    Smell: Light, grainy aroma with plenty of citric hops: citrus zest, faint tropical fruit and grass.    Taste: Pale malts build a solid, lightly sweet base for waves of hops. Citrus, grapefruit rind, pineapple, and herbal pine resin. Closes with a clean, crisp bitterness.    Mouthfeel: Medium body, slightly oily feel and crisp, moderate carbonation.    Overall: Solid, classic IPA; nothing heavy handed, just well balanced and very drinkable.

Diabolical is maltier, and generally a bit more bitter. Two hearted pours a cloudy light amber with a decent head. Both are well crafted brews, with the style differences the most distinguishing difference.

L: Pours like a legit American IPA, amber with a moderate head  S: Grapefruit and malty smell, knew immediately that this was gonna be a smooth finish.   T: Real let down, doesn't pack a punch or really differentiate itself, hype definitely made it worse for me. Grapefruitty taste with a malty, almost frothy finish. Too light.  F: Smooth but lacking character. As our "president" would say: SAD!  O: 3.69, nothing great but definitely not a bad beer. Would recommend at like a relatively poor package store, otherwise there will be better beers on the shelf.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 How have i not reviewed this yet? - Poured into a custom grip shaped glass: color is straw/gold, head is off white with fine bubbles and presents at least 1 inch thick, head lingers well and leaves a solid 1/4 inch top and spotty lacing on the glass.     Smell is all centennial hops: great pleasant flavor, simple and enticing.     Taste is similarly simple, but great: malt is light, noticeable and balancing, yeast leaves a hint of fruitiness, but the centennial takes the finish with the pleasant light grapefruit and earthy hop presence, even light floral/herbal note as well.     The mouthfeel of this beer has always been a standout component: lightly sweet, but bitter - flavor lingers on the tongue and bitterness has a good presence throughout.     Overall: a style defining beer, a beer i've always gone to on tap when looking for an ipa, and one you want to emulate in your homebrewing repertoire.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 12 oz bottle with printed date only 2 weeks ago. Pours deep golden and looks a bit less creamy than I usually like. Foamy head without much retention. Aroma is pleasant and subdued; I get mostly stone fruit and a little orange, some pine and citrus, grass and earth. Taste is unexpectedly and jarringly unrelated to the nose. Heavily reliant on resinous piney bitterness, there is some citrus and stone fruit worked in as well as noticeable grass, earth, rocks... and the bitterness keeps going and takes on a slight metallic quality and continues through a long, bitter finish.  Overall I do understand the hype and can appreciate how well crafted it is especially for hop heads. I personally found the bitterness too unbalanced. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one to shy from a DIPA with 100 IBUs, but some balance is key.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 A true classic. This American IPA does just about everything right. It has a mix of hops that creates a strong citrus aroma and a bitter/sour mix flavor mix that shouts grapefruit. The haze suspends the flavors, which coat the tastebuds. A little more carbonation would add to the mix. This is my favorite American ale.

I'd be hard pressed to say much about taste notes beyond grapefruit, orange, and pine, but the beer has a nice kick to it, and a crisp finish that dries out the mouth like a real IPA. This beer reminds me a lot of Oberon but with a hefty dose of Centennial hops in place of the wheat. It's very near perfect.

It has a pleasing amber color as it pours out, creating a nice foamy head. The taste is quite flavorful, probably one of the best that there is in an IPA and not overly pungent as some others. The taste of the ale lingers over the palate; truly an outstanding quality. It has a very pleasing aroma, unlike some others. I have tried this beer before but it had been awhile back and I wanted to try it again; and it will be on my list of brews to get again.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Brewed in Michigan and named after the Two Hearted River I must recommend this beer to everyone because I consider Bells Two Hearted American IPA to be the gold standard for American IPA's. I absolutely love this beer and it seems to be one of the most popular AIPA's in my region, NYC metro area quickly gaining market share across the United States.     Look: Golden - healthy carbonation. I usually drink out of the bottle because I can't wait. Served in a visually pleasing brown bottle with gorgeous painting of a trout on the label and on the cap.     Smell: Two hearted gives off a delicious floral clean arouma of pine coupled with slightly fruity flowery accents. Envision yourself laying in a field of wild flowers surrounded on the periphery by a forrrest of pines.     Taste: Hoppy piney flavor not overly fruity - perfectly balanced with malt. Very drinkable. 7.0% ABV    Feel: Perfect Buzz. Amazing beer for those who like to have a beer on the hiking trail or outdoors in the sun - not too heavy. I never get a bloated feeling while drinking Bells two hearted and I really enjoy the AIPA light buzz. Goes down very easy. Favorite beer hands down.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5 From a 12 oz bottle dated 5/1/17. Pours a slightly hazy reddish orange with a big head, leaving a lot of lacing down the glass. The smell is packed with citrus, but that's about all I'm getting.    This is a hop bomb as soon as it hits my mouth, but it backs off quickly. Citrus-y and fruity, with an underlying sweetness to it that's especially prevalent in big gulps. There's definitely some tangerine in here. The bitterness is nice, not too harsh, and is accompanied by just a hint of pine that you don't really get in the nose, but it lingers in the aftertaste. One of the most complex IPAs I've encountered, and I'm a big fan.     Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, not too heavy or sticky and not too thin and carbonated either, just about the perfect feel for an IPA. This is extremely drinkable, refreshing, and great for the price.

Two finger head that settles rocky and lasts. Some sticky lacing after beer warms. The smell is clean citrus hops with an underlying fruitiness. Grapefruit and tangerine. Maybe strawberries? My wife who does not drink at all thinks the smell is terrific.    Taste is of course hops up front. The rest completely follows the nose. Both citrus and some melon. Watermelon? Malts are not outstanding but with enough backbone to carry and balance the hops but is not huge on the palate. Very juicy.     Medium body that carries the hops well. Building malts as as the beer warms leaving a bit of bread on the finish for a fuller mouthfeel. Crisp, fresh and extremely drinkable. Definitely carved out a spot in my beer cooler.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 From can at home. Dated 4/18/17. As the name implies this is one of the sweethearts of IPAs & deservedly so. I am not a big IPA guy, but there are afew exceptions & this may find itself on this short list.    Pours with abright white tight suds head floating on a rich, lightly hazed honey golden hue. The head gives way to sparce lacing. The most remarkable trait is the luscious texture rife with fruity essence. I find the lavor bordering on an apricot/peach tinge. Hearesey, you say? Perhaps, but it's all a matter of taste.    As I usually avoid IPAs I'm not comfortable drawing comparisons, but I know what I like & it's easy to see why this has such a following.    Thank you Bell's for opening my eyes. I'm pleased add it to the short list shared by Cigar City Jai Lai, Racer 5 & perhaps 5 other of the hundreds out there.

It has the classic "grapefruit" taste, but not as strong as something like Dogfish Head. If you like IPA's, you'll love it. If you're not familiar with IPA's, this is a good one to start with. The price is right around $10-11.00 for a 6 pack of bottles. 4 packs of cans aren't much cheaper. If you do end up with cans, remember, this isn't Busch Light. Give it some dignity, and pour it into a glass. ;)

Some ringy lace, slightly sticky.  The aroma had a wonderful dose of sweet fresh pine, floral bitterness and sturdy caramel malt base.  The flavor was a fabulous blend of the prior aromatic qualities - sweet to bitter and back through intertwining eloquently into a clean aftertaste.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt appropriate.  Overall, pretty nice AIPA that brought me into the beer world when I lived in Michigan. Always a post fishing beer whenever I finished fishing the St. Mary's River in Sault Ste. Marie.

This gives a 2 finger head.  The color is a light straw.  The aroma is a nice citrusey pine.  The taste is a distinct citrus/pine.  Bitterness is mild toward the back of the palate with a hint of malt which offers a smooth finish.  Overall, love the flavors, but not quite as crisp and refreshing as Sierra Nevada.

The taste is a perfect blend of hops and malt. And at the price point, it's a very reasonable daily drinker. I recommend any ipa enthusiast to try this if they haven't already.

The aroma is very nice with touches of citrus, a little pine, and just a really nice citrus smell.    Taste: Not really one overwhelming taste. A nice blend of multiple flavors with all of them blending nicely. The one flavor you do get is the nice citrus you expect from an IPA.     Overall, this is a very good beer that is extremely smooth and easy to drink. No trace of the 7% alcohol present and just a really nice looking and tasting beer.

With an incredible creamy white head and lacework, balance   and mouthfeel to spare, a nose of citrus and just-enough pine, and the most enjoyable hop-soup palate for this type of IPA you'll ever find, Two Hearted is a Midwestern classic that you can't leave behind once you've left. I love this beer.

S: Floral, citrus, very lemony, some pine, a bit grassy, some bready malt, and a little caramel sweetness.    T: Floral, citrus, lemon, grapefruit, spicy pine, bready malt, and caramel sweetness.    M: Medium body, moderate carbonation.    O: It's hard to compare an old school IPA like this to all the modern super hopped stuff, but it still holds its own. Really nice use of centennial hops.

L- Thick soapy white colored head that stands 1 finger tall,with very good retention and sticky lacing.Light orange colored body with low clarity,and distorted light showing through the glass.Low amount of carbonation,high amount of sediment.    S- On the nose I get tons of citrus and tropical fruit hops (orange and mango),pine hops,and some faint hints of sweet breaded malt notes.Fruity hops definitely steal the show.Floral hop presence as well.    T- On the palate I get bitter pine hops and grapefruit up front,tropical and citrus fruit hops in the middle,and some sweat breaded malts balanced by pine hops on the back end.Very well balanced IPA.    F- The mouth feel is bordering on thin and medium,with a silky texture.Moderate amount of oxidation on the tongue with a smooth finish.    O- This is probably one of the best IPA's I have tried,that is available in Florida.Very well balanced with a beautiful hop presence.This is about as close to a "juice bomb" as you get in Florida.I could drink this beer all year round.I highly recommend this brew if you are a hop head,and an IPA lover.

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 12 oz bottle dated 02/28/17 into a snifter.    Pours a lightly hazy golden orange color with a finger of off-white head. The head settles into a thin film that rests atop the beer, leaving a ton of lacing as it goes. Pretty much the perfect looking beer. Beer porn, if you will.    The aroma is extremely floral and dank, bringing notes of ruby red grapefruit, orange peel, and sticky pine. The back end is full of toasted malt, bringing a good amount of balance to the aroma.    The taste is more of the same. Orange and grapefruit, followed by some sweet caramel malt and finished off by a tidal wave of pine.    The feel is medium-light bodied with good carbonation. Goes down very smooth, yet has a crisp bite to it that is quite refreshing. Very dry and resinous.    Overall, an excellent IPA. It's far from the biggest or baddest IPA out there, but it's exceptionally balanced and extremely well-made. This is a beer I could drink all year long, and I wish I could.

I don't love IPA, but this is about as good as I've ever had. I'll definitely have another    edit: This beer changed my whole opinion of IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter via a friend from work---THANKS KEVIN!  This fine ale pours a chill hazed golden amber color with a nice head of white foam that  settles to a thick big bubbled ring, thin light pool, and features some darn nice sticky lacing.   Nose of heavy pine hops, sweet malts, honey, and a touch of orange rind with other light  citrus notes. Flavors lightly exceed by presentation with citrus touched hops featuring orange   zest zest and subtle pineapple notes touched by light breaded malts and honey that fade into  the background with a sticky pine note. Nice mouth feel; medium body, medium carbonation,   and a citrus and pine laden hoppy finish.     Overall, a legend among the craft brew scene and a solid IPA.    Cheers

Pours a slightly hazy amber with a nice two finger head that is thick and foamy, lasting, and has good lacing. It has a decent aroma of sweet citrusy hops and bready malts. Sweet, hoppy and mildly bitter, it has a decent malt to hop balance with some caramel sweetness and a smooth finish. Light to medium body and carbonation this drinks fast.    This is good stuff, not a hoppy juice bomb, but a great representative IPA.

I just got Two Hearted this time because there were one or two more exciting choices and a LOT of really cheap incredible beers or ones that I hadn't heard of.    Pours an orange gold with a bit of haze into a pint glass. Keeps a thin ring of foam and one-sided, spotty lacing. The smell and taste take this to a whole new level.    Smell is dank, piney, grapefruit, thing wreeks of hops. Taste follows suit with the hoppy bitter, pine, grass, grapefruit, and a floral aftertaste. This beer is pretty crazy good. I very much regret not going ahead and grabbing the full Bell's catalogue available at the store so I could give all their beers a shot.     Maybe you guys across the country are spoiled, but this is super good and deserves the ratings I am throwing at it. The freshness has to have something to do with it, being packaged on 2/21/17. Good shit!

Citrus with some slight caramel base and slight piney hop. Not as strong as I would have imagined. There is a bigger piney hop to the taste. Mild citrus with a malty caramel ending. Maybe some slight honey. Mildly astringent finish. Not quite what I was expecting. More of a malty base, while I tend to venture more towards the West Coast style. This was bottled just over a month ago, so it is still fresh, but would like to try one less than a week old.

Taste is something else. As in, something unlike so many ipa's that have soaked the market.....this   Juicy grapefruit, massive hop bitterness. Tasty in that another sip can't come soon enough. Peppery, with what to me has a pilsner-like malt quality, and it feels so smooth...medium-bodied. Zesty orange notes come through as I sip it longer. Impressive IPA taste. I'm equally impressed by the malt backbone. The flavor and balance with the centennial hops is superb there. The easiest benchmark IPA to compare it with, as far as centennial-hopped IPAs go, would be Founder's IPA. Only issue there, in my book, is that this Bell's IPA appears to be the new benchmark. Glad they came to Texas.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I like Two Hearted as a beer in general, but as an IPA it falls short of the other benchmarks now. It's what IPA tasted like 15 - 20 years ago. Then, it would have stood out. Now, not so much. Looks and smells "proper," but it doesn't have much taste or mouthfeel impression. It is a mid-pack IPA now, especially given that it's a solid 7.0% ABV, and there are much better ones out there. Still, it is a smooth, even-handed version of the style. UPDATE: better taste and mouthfeel (9.4.2018). Somehow this tastes different than when I had it 5 years ago in Chicago at multiple places on tap.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Served in a conical pint at Mermaid Inn on UWS, NYC, presumably from a bottle. A: Golden orange with 3/8", foamy white head and substantial lacing.   S: Aromas of lemon citrus, honey, mowed grass, initially, dissipating with the head. T: Tastes refreshing with notes of grapefruit/lemon/peach nicely balanced with bittering for a clean finish.   M: Medium bodied. Solid effervescence.   O: A nicely executed IPA; would serve or drink again.
