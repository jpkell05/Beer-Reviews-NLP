look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 This is a beer that I haven't previously reviewed because I never it liked as much as the score indicates I should (it's got a strange bitterness to me). This time, I opened a 2014 bottle in 2019, and though it's slightly better, it still has an odd bitterness for me.    Appearance – Pours a nice black color with a surprisingly thick chocolate colored head (surprising due to the aging on this bottle). Slightly larger than normal sized bubbles in the head that stick to the walls of the glass. A nice looking beer!    Smell – Malt, molasses, licorice, cherry bark, oak, and red wine. A very light hint of bourbon and vanilla.    Taste – Somewhat bitter. Tastes of malt, oak, and wine. Maybe just a hint of bourbon.     Mouthfeel – A nice creamy stout, though it has a lingering bitter aftertaste.    Drinkability – For me, this is just an ok stout. I personally find their Obsidian Stout much better.

Aroma is complex with molasses, dark chocolate, licorice, but with strong notes of dark fruits.  Taste has the dark fruits and molasses up front with licorice, bittersweet chocolate, but a strong sense of coffee as well as cherry in the back. Bitterness lingers in the smooth full mouthfeel, increasingly complex as it warms. Wonderful beer.

Its it an intense looking beer.  An equally intense aroma. Roasted malts, dark molasses, very woody with lots of anise, dates and dark currants.  Aggressive yet balanced taste. Roasted malts, dark molasses, oaky, intense spices, a solid dose of valilla, espresso bitterness and barrel char in the finish.  Surprisingly smooth mouth feel, drier in the finish. A good nip of alcohol. Tannins and cherries in the after taste. Heavy body medium carbonation.

It is topped with a couple inches of deep mocha head that clings to the sides of the glass as it recedes like my hairline.    I notice dark fruits at first. Cherry and plum come to mind. Anise is the next thing my schnozz detects. Dark chocolate and coffee round out the aroma.    The taste starts with dark fruit. Chocolate follows with anise right on its heels. The finish is slightly bitter with roasted grain and black coffee.     Full bodied with smooth mouthfeel    This beer is fruity and complex. Each sip has several flavors, and the beer has held up nicely.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Bottle Date: 2015  Palate Contaminants: none    Here's hoping I didn't wait too long. I'll revisit if I think age is too much of a detriment.    Color is that opaque dark brown that doesn't really let any light through. Head is a very fine light brown that looks like a mousse. A reasonable amount of lacing considering the type.    Smell has tons of dark fruits like raisins, prunes, and dates. They're sweet, and that's nicely integrated (or "natural" if I wasn't tryin' to be so fancy). It just smells thick and heavy. It's fair to say there's a little bit of cocoa and a little brown sugar in there, as well.    Those same fruits are also there in the taste, but they have a lot of anise flavor to compete with. Coffee, too. Bitterness and some charcoal taste hit late, and they're every bit as intense as the other flavors. There's also a mineral quality that isn't particularly common in the brewing arts. It could substitute nicely for a ruby port.    The aftertaste has too much of the charcoal. The bitterness is okay, but I'd love it if some of the other things left the party late, too. Good medium-heavy carbonation, and medium weight for the type. Alcohol is noticeable, especially later.    So, I might not require a revisit to the baseline Abyss, but I am curious about how it is when younger.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Date: Bottled on 10/30/17, savored on 12/05/18.    Appearance: Pours black as night with a dark mocha head the barely cover the top of the beer. The lacing clings to the glass beautifully when I give it a swirl before slowly cascading back down.     Aroma: The aroma is a large amount of vanilla bean, dark chocolate, bourbon sweetness, roasted malts, chocolate covered fruit, coffee, some licorice, and syrupy molasses.     Taste: Big bourbon barrel character with a significant oak presence which gives way to sweeter flavors of vanilla and rich dark molasses and then the beer descends into the abyss with bitter dark chocolate notes and a bottomless cavern of roasted malts. The aftertaste is a whole bouquet of dark fruit and coffee notes. As the beer reaches room temperature, or I find the bottom of the abyss, a few things happen. A very slight soy sauce flavor does come out, but nothing that really damages the rating as it can easily be ignored with the myriad of other flavors. The ABV does become a little more noticeable, but I wouldn't say this beer is hot. Also, the malt roast and oak characters intensify. The mouthfeel on The Abyss is thick and full with the texture remaining totally smoove. This is one of the best damn beers I've ever tasted. I have without a doubt spent more money on The Abyss than any other single beer and every time I crack a bottle I remember why it is worth every penny of the $18 it retails for.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Pours a deep, thick black with no head or lacing.    The smell is oak and red wine with a little chocolate and bourbon.    The taste shows the red wine and some black liquorice. There's also a strong leather/char taste. It's pretty bitter on the finish.    The mouthfeel is thinner than expected but still velvety.    A very nice beer although less depth of flavor than expected. I'd like to try one that fresher to compare.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 A very nice imperial stout but the stronger flavors of raisin and licorice were just a little too much for me. Pours a deep, rich dark black color with great dark tan head and sheets of lacing. Smells of deep rich chocolate and coffee, along with fainter dark stone fruit, malt and caramel. Tastes of deep dark roast coffee, dark chocolate mocha, vanilla, caramel, raisin, molasses, brown sugar, malt and licorice. Just too much raisin and licorice for me. Smooth mild mouthfeel, surprisingly not that creamy. Clean and silky, just enough carbonation. A strong beer but a little disappointing given the huge ratings and reviews here.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 A lot toastier and maltier with some good dark chocolate taste. Not sweet like so many in this style but in a good way. Oddly, I drank the bottle over two days and it actually tasted better after being exposed for a day.

This beer pours out pitch black and forms a thick and creamy caramel colored crown. Bubbles of all sizes bursting with sweet and roasty notes to my nose. Almost a burnt chocolate smell with the molasses definitely being present. Black licorice is making its presence known with that sharp smell, (metallic too?) It's like a big roasty, burnt sweetness. It comes in with the taste being roastier than any beer I've had in quite a while, maybe ever. It's not like a coffee roasty though, it's like a burnt sweetness just like the nose. Its even almost metallic. The mouthfeel is dry leaving a smokey note. Overall, this is really not what I expected and I'm not quite sure if I like it. I like having something different and a change of pace, but I don't think I would grab this again. And the metallic notes were a little much for me.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 2015 reserve. This bottle has a "best after" date of 12/08/2016.    Appearance - Pours a dark molasses brown with two fingers of mocha head.    Smell - Oak bourbon barrel, vanilla bean, earthy and leafy hops, black licorice, vinous and woody aromas.    Taste - Roasted malts, earthy and leafy hops, vanilla, licorice, warm woody oak flavour.     Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and slightly sticky with lingering oak notes and warmth from the alcohol.    Overall - A deep, rich Abyss brew from Deschutes. Even after aging for 2-3 years, the flavours in this beer are well-balanced and harmonious.

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Pour: bottled 10/30/17. Poured into a tulip glass. Jet black, absolutely opaque. Two finger tan foam head. Slowly dissipates leaving cloudy bubbles on top and beautiful lacing. Initial temp about 45 degrees. Warmed to about — when drinking     Nose: red wine upfront, bourbon, dark fruit, oak, molasses. Lots going on and well balanced. Could smell this all night.     Taste (45-50 degrees): surprisingly bitter hops/dark chocolate upfront. Not at all what I expected based on the nose. Molasses sweetness in the middle and backend with a little oak. Even a little grapefruit aftertaste. Don’t get a lot of bourbon, wine or anything else initially.     Taste (55-60 degrees): Bourbon notes more pronounced as it warms. Much less bitter as well. Red wine notes now very evident and more dark fruit as well.   Less chocolate but still present. Molasses still there as well. But, this isn’t a super sweet desert beer. Definitely better as it warms.     Mouthfeel: low to moderate carbonation. A little thinner than expected but still substantial. Creamy but not overly viscous.     Overall: this is a really good beer but slightly disappointing taste relative to the description, expectations and the nose. Definitely let it warm. I will probably buy one more to cellar but have mixed feelings.

Consumed on 7/29/17.    A: Very dark brown and opaque, with a thin tan head that lasts quite well. A fairly low amount of visible carbonation.    S: Sweet malts and oak, bourbon and chocolate. Tannins and vanilla, with some tobacco and licorice. Leather and cacao powder. Smells quite good and fairly complex.    T: Chocolate, roasted malts, and bourbon. Oak, vanilla, and some char with a mild smoke character. Tobacco and anise. Dry tannins and a mild coffee. Roasted bitterness, with a milder amount of hop bitterness, and sweet chocolate in hang.    M: A medium body for an Imperial Stout. Low carbonation overall, but probably average for style. The alcohol presence is restrained for the style, but certainly still warming.    O: Very enjoyable. The roasty and char and anise aspects add up to maybe not blowing me out of the water, but remains interesting, enjoyable, and complex. Big roastiness for sure though. In the interest of full disclosure, this my opinion of this may have suffered a bit from being drank directly after the Cycle DB Vanilla DOS.

The smell is strong on roast and light on coffee.  The taste starts good and as it warms it changes to even more complex. I love the vanilla that comes through in a stout as it warms. I also taste hints of cherry as it warms.  Thick and delicious. Shared a 22 oz with 2 buddies will definitely find another bottle to put away in my cooler.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Happy birthday to me! Not only is it my birthday, but I’ve also got a beer I’ve been waiting to get my hands on since I joined BeerAdvocate and began my craft journey all the way back on Jan 13th 2011: Deschutes The Abyss. Even saying the name of this beer out loud fills me with a sense of awe (and trepidation at the 11.4% ABV within) this brew is going to be BIG in so many ways, with headline ingredients such as: black strap molasses, licorice, cherry bark, vanilla bean, and 50% aged in bourbon, wine, and new Oregon oak barrels - PHWOAR! Let me repeat myself for emphasis: PHWOAR! The only [first-world] problem I’m facing is the prospect of finishing off a 650ml bottle by myself... yes, it’s not a terrible situation to be in.    Poured from a 650ml US Bomber sized wax-sealed bottle into a Duvel tulip.    A: Inky black like the expansive vacuum of space, with a deep tan head that hangs around for as long as I’ve seen in any Stout north of 11% before fizzling out leaving a patchwork of bubble and lace. Peering down into the glass is like looking at a mini universe - epic in many ways this beer. 9/10.    S: Red wine really comes through in the first whiff, then licorice, molasses, dark fruits (plum and prune), oaky vanilla/woody tones, espresso coffee, and finally a sweet lick of bourbon. Incredibly complex aroma that shifts as it gets warmer - it’s hard not to like it, there’s something in this that every Stout drinker will like, and the name is fitting - it really is like peering into the abyss. 9/10.    T: Yep, Deschutes nailed it. Flavour incorporates all of the above: red wine (Shiraz I think), licorice, molasses, dark fruits, oaky vanilla/woody tones, espresso coffee, and a touch of bourbon. Then it throws in a bit more: burnt sugar, light bitter herbal notes, red coffee cherries, touch of smoke and a hint of cinnamon. Possibly one of the busiest Imp Stouts I’ve ever had the pleasure of tasting. Balances a tad on the sweeter side, though more herbal bitterness comes through in the aftertaste with a delayed reaction. Brutal and inspiring this brew is. 10/10.    M: Heavy bodied and viscous, it’s about a Barry White on the Founders Scale IMO. Carbonation is dying star dense and lush almost to a fault. 9/10.    D: As I imagined all these years? Yes, this beer terrifies in name and in taste - it’s every bit the behemoth I dreamt it would be, and Deschutes does not disappoint. As far as the bottle goes - I am going to struggle on my own, this is too big a brew for one man, but I’ll go down fighting the good fight ;). 9/10.    Food match: Replace the after dinner port with this beer, and cigars: yes.

Dark cherries and currants on the nose, with booze and a little molasses and a little roasted malt. It's really more carbonated than I anticipated. Upon taste I immediately get dark fruit, burnt molasses, dark roasted malt and a surprising amount of bitter hops. The alcohol is there, but not overpowering. It's honestly not nearly as sweet as I thought it would be, definitely more bitter. It's sips sweet at first then shifts to bitter. I had this beer beer fresh but honestly don't remember a lot about it, it was pre beer advocate for me. Overall a solid ba stout. I wish I would have noted my first so I could comment on what age did for this stout.

It is a really great stout. I've told it has kept up its great flavor and it also ages well.    Look: Jet black with a very thick and fluffy mocca colored head    Aroma: roasted malts, dark fruit, chocolate    Taste: The flavor is roasted malts, chocolate, dark fruit, hint of coffee, maybe cherries and red wine, mild bourbon, maybe licorice but not much, mild booziness.    Feel: medium to full body

I really like the mouthfeel--not cloying but coats the tongue and then dissipates. I like it, but would rather age it for a year or two.

Leaves some random spots of lace as the head disappears.    The aroma is very nutty, bringing notes of pecans and almonds. There's some vanilla and oak before a strong roasted malt character. There's also some subtle fig and raisin with the faintest hint of chocolate chip cookie dough.    The taste is very roasted and malty up front, followed by a ton of dark fruits and vanilla. There's a suggestion of coffee beans and dark chocolate on the finish.    The feel is medium bodied with lower carbonation. Smooth, yet exceptionally dry. Boozy, but not overly so.    Overall, a great stout that is more about the malt and roasted character than chocolate and coffee, making this a unique imperial stout. The body is disappointing but this is an otherwise great beer. Over hyped to be sure, but still good.

It seems like February 2018 is long enough to wait.     It pours black with a reasonable head and consistent bubbles. The aroma is complex to a fault - roasty malts plus all the amazing barrel agedness that is this brew. The taste follows suit with deep roasty taste plus all kinds of tasty boozy undertones. The actual alcohol taste is balanced with all the other barrel aging all nicely mellowed together. It's sweet but not at all overly so. Plenty of bitterness still shines through. It definitely aged very well.    Highly recommended. I need to find some more to set aside for the future.

There was a 3/4", khaki brown, creamy, long-lasting head. Excellent lacing.     S: An overly subtle aroma of roasted malt, bourbon, dark fruit, and a burnt quality.    T: Tasted of a moderate amount of bourbon (and its accompanying oak barrel), some mild dark chocolate notes, lactose, a bit of the burnt quality, dark fruit (plums, raisins), a lot of roasted malt, and a tinge of coffee. An uneven flavor, to be sure. Some of the elements are omnipresent (the char), while others are barely there (the chocolate).     F: A solid amount of carbonation with a dry finish. Medium-bodied.    O: Definitely an uneven beer. Like a lot of Deschutes' offerings, this one is overrated. Not that it's bad, just wildly uneven.

Decided I was tired of waiting so I would celebrate our once-in-a-generation snow, ice and sleet.    You know that girl you've always wanted to date? You finally get the date and here comes the first kiss...and it's going to be awesome.     Well, that's what drinking this was like. The buildup was great, anticipation fantastic, the pour was excellent. Dark, nice aroma, crema colored head. Could. Not. Wait. To. Drink. And then I realized my awesome dreamgirl that I was kissing had just smoked a pack of cigs and I got to taste them all, too.    There were parts of the flavor that were fine (I guess, the memories are kinda hazy now) but the overwhelming flavor was burnt campfire wood. If this was aged in bourbon barrels then those barrels must have been set on fire on the inside, the charcoal scraped off, those charcoal filings left in the barrel and the beer poured in and aged.     All I can say is I'm glad I hadn't waited to share this with friends. Based on the reviews maybe I got a bad bottle, maybe I'm just overly sensitive to 'charcoal' flavors, maybe when I licked my fireplace clean that afternoon some of the taste stayed with me. Who knows?    Anyway, I would give this another shot because the other reviews are soooo good. But the next time it won't be on my dime.

Taste was a little harsh, and I might attribute that to the partial aging in wine barrels (I'll stick to bourbon). I feel like this was the taste that hit me the most, rather than any of the other flavors listed. Not a terrible beer, but probably wouldn't buy again given the price. Still have two bottles that I'll let sit for a year or two to see if it mellows out.

The initial taste was similar to the nose, molasses, raisins, dark chocolate and coffee. The finish was where I began to have problems, it was extremely bitter, stronger than 100% cocoa. It kind of tasted like black walnuts. Everything else regarding this beer was spot on but the aftertaste resulted in me pouring this one out.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 2017 bottle served in a tulip glass. Pours pitch black with an espresso head. You have to pour it hard to get any head and it dissipates quickly. You can tell this is a thick stout from the pour.     The nose was dominated by a sour note and to be honest I was afraid it may be infected or something happened to my bottle. However, I remembered it is aged in wine barrels and spiced with cherry bark so maybe that had some impact on the nose. Aside from the sourness in the nose all I could get was typical stout notes of roasted malt/coffee.     The flavor consisted of espresso, roasted malt, a hint of sourness, a hint of booze, and a long lingering bitterness from the licorice. I could not detect any vanilla or bourbon/oak flavors. To me the flavor could was too dominated by espresso, a sour note, and licorice to be a very good tasting beer. The licorice gave it an incredibly long and lingering bitterness that I found unpleasant - it reminded me of aspirin, but not quite as harsh. This was nowhere near as complex and delicious as I expected.    The mouthfeel was very good as it was thick and chewy as I prefer.    Overall, I think this would be better with about 2 years of age on it so maybe the espresso/licorice would mellow. I had been very excited about this beer and expected it to be one of the best beers I had tried, but it was a major disappointment. There was not much complexity to me and it was overly bitter from the espresso and licorice that dominated the flavor profile. I couldn't even finish the bomber. I still gave it a "good" in taste because maybe it was just me based on this beer's status and I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt. I cannot believe I am going to say this but this is probably my least favorite offering I've tried from Deschutes. Also, I had unreasonably high expectations. I'll try again someday.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 22 oz bottle (2017 reserve bottled on 10/30/17, 11.4%) poured into a tulip glass, black as night, with one and half finger dark tan head that retains well. Now that Deschutes has started distributing to NC, was finally able to come across this on a recent Brawley's visit. The aroma is apparent while even several feet away, cherry and sour notes up front, underneath is chocolate, cocoa, vanilla and licorice. Some bourbon, but faint, is in the mix as well. The taste......its all there, but melded together nicely with no flavors dominating and some mild smoke thrown in for a good measure. You can pick up some of wine and oak aging in the finish of the swig. The mouthfeel is interesting, fairly heavy but not overly so, and not sticky, with a medium level of carbonation. Overall, a interestingly different imperial stout from the regular bourbon barrel variety, and it has black strap molasses! Which I will admit, I had never heard of before, looked it up, and was glad to see that it helps relieve stress. After finishing both ends of the bomber, consider that claim correct. Recommended.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This is the 2017 Abyss. Pours a beautiful oily black, with some slight tan head which quickly dissipates. The smell is a mixture of bourbon, chocolate, and slight vanilla. The taste is amazing. By reading the label, which mentions molasses, licorice, vanilla, spices, cherry bark, and aging in several different barrels, one might think it'd be overdone with too many competing flavors, but it is quite tasty, and somewhat milder than one might expect. It starts with the bourbon & chocolate, and ends with the cherry, licorice, and a slight tartness, due (I presume) to the aging in pinot noir wine barrels. Velvety smooth, and none of the flavors are harsh or overpowering. Mouthfeel is somewhat thick, but about what I think it should be. Can't find the abv rating, but past versions of the Abyss were 11-12%, so I presume this one is also within that range. But there is no overly strong alcohol flavor. Very nicely done. Highly recommended.

Pours jet black and thick as tar, I was expecting very little head, so poured with a good bit of vigor, and got about two inches of stable, tight, tan/khaki colored head that is stable as all get out and leaves loads of lacing on the glass as you drink. Absolutely beautiful in the glass, albeit a tad unexpected. The aforementioned thick head gives off a huge nose of vanilla, oak, and chocolate, with less bourbon that I'd anticipated, and with most of the emphasis being on the chocolaty/vanilla character, with a touch of licorice. Taste brings a lot more layers of the same characteristics. You first taste the chocolate and the molasses makes its presence known, you then get a big hit of dark coffee, vanilla, bitter dark malts, and the taste finishes with oak, a touch of bourbon, and dark red wine, with a dryness similar to that of a Bordeaux Superieur, leaving you wanting another sip. In the finish, there is also a lingering hint of the licorice, which I appreciate a lot. Feel of this beer is very full in body with a thick, luxurious mouthfeel, but only the smallest trace of alcohol as you swallow. Overall, absolutely phenomenal stuff. The best part definitely being that all of the flavors of all of the different flavorings and techniques come through gracefully along the palette without blacking out any others. Complex and layered, its definitely something to sip, to let warm in your glass , and to savor over the course of a few hours. Perfect for late, cold, late december nights.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 This is the 2016 Reserve The Abyss, bottled on 12/08/16, carefully aged by me before chilling. The 22oz bottle is awkwardly topped, above the standard metal cap, with black wax. Served in a chalice style glass. The beer pours black and oily and is topped with a thick, richly colored brown head. But before you can even look at this brew the smell of bourbon is overwhelming. No, aroma has not diminished too badly with age. Inhaling deeply, I get sweet oak in addition to the boozy vanilla bourbon. The first sip is alarmingly delicate. This year was 11.1% ABV, and I was afraid it was going to be a mass of ethanol, molasses, and barrel. There's a grape-y fruit sweetness from the wine barrels and cherry bark. It may be the age (I believe this is my first experience with The Abyss), but the spicing is very subdued, only really making itself known as an anise note in the aftertaste.    More than anything I'm impressed with how complex and delicate the flavors in this beer are. It absolutely lives up to its hype, and there are no punishing, harsh, or otherwise out of balance flavors which detract from the experience. This is no session beer (...for the sane-minded...) but I would absolutely pay the price of admission again.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours a chocolatey dark brown with a finger-and-a-half of tan foam. Soupy lacing.    Red wine, cherry, sherry, oak, licorice, molasses and vanilla in the nose. Honestly, it's more red wine forward than I'd like and had me a little worried that it may have turned -- but I don't believe that's the case.    Kiss of sweet vanilla and chocolate up front upon sipping, then assertive bitterness with a mix dark chocolate, grassy hops, wood, leather, tobacco, molasses and red wine. Some alcohol burn lingers with the strong bitterness in the aftertaste.    Medium bodied with sufficient heft and carbonation.    I love the bitterness in this one, but the red wine character isn't my jam. Wish they'd stuck with bourbon and oak barrels, and skipped the wine barrels. Still great to try. 2012 Reserve.

Look - pitch black like an Abyss. 1/2 finger dark creamy tan head that quickly dissipates to just a tan ring. Lovely!  Smell - leather up front for me. Dark fruit like plum but not raisin. Some red wine.   Taste - smooth moving very quickly to bitter and again quick to back off. Again a dark red wine (not woody) but just the deeper notes. Some dark chocolate but no coffee. Leather but no tobacco. Alcohol present but not hot or boozy. Very complex and balanced.  Feel - exquisite, thick luscious, silky. Am I describing a beautiful girl? This is damned lovely! Maintains an effervescence to bite.  Overall - this is worth the price to me at least to have experienced it and added it to my beer belt notch. I would get it again . . . And now know where!!!

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 If I had to name the beer that sparked my interest in expanding my beer tastes, knowledge, and ambitions, it would be the Abyss. The 2016 Reserve is one of my favorite iterations of the classic. It pours smooth and viscous with a thin head the color of burnt umber. Expect cocoa and coffee on the nose with a bit of vanilla and molasses joining in the taste. Not nearly as sweet as I would expect for an over an over 10% ABV Imperial Stout, it is certainly a complex beer that pairs well with a cigar on a brisk evening.

I had some nice people to share it.    This has to be one of the smoothest, flavorful beers I have had. Smells wonderfully chocolatey. Taste is a great mix of chocolate, licorice, warm spice and a bit of coffeee.    It has been in the frig for awhile, but this was the perfect time to drink it! Kendall and all.

This 2015 is drinking amazing at this point. Wish I could get more!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Okay quick one here: Considering all of the Imperial Stouts I have had in my time as a BA, this one may be the best. The look is black with the thinnest of heads. The smell is amazing, I get bitter chocolate, barrel, leather and some dark fruits. I could spend hours just enjoying the aroma. The taste...all the flavors of the aroma, with the barrel and cocoa really battling it out. But the other flavors don't give up the fight, they come in...as the beer warms the leather moves forward. The feel is thick and chewy, you can almost feel the legs of the booze, but it is incredibly subtle.     Simply put, an experience. This is an amazing beer, which if I can get my hands on again, I will.

Very nice looking brew.    Aroma is mice lots of roasted malts lots of vanilla and dry oak, sweet molasses every where with bourbon notes and even lighter vinous hints for the Pinot Noir barrels, Kind of reminds me of a mixed barrel aged brew from High-Wire but a tad sweeter. Good chocolate notes lots of roasted malts just a bunch of yummy goodness.    Taste is lots of roasted malts, good sweetness and vanilla, good coffee notes almost lactose like sweetness, guess form all the malts floating past my tongue. Some bourbon barrel kick in the finish with lingering vanilla and sweetness very light wine hints that have to be searched for. Overall a complex and wonderful stout, alcohol notes on this bog boy are well hidden and blend well. Lightly dry seems some people found it too dry but I am enjoying this brew very tasty yes a little pricey but will be picking up another bottle if its still in stock and it probably will be for the price.    Mouthfeel is nice chewy full bodied but carbonation could be a touch smother as it tend to lighten the feel a touch.    Overall I really am enjoying this big stout, maybe I'm just in the mood for one, but loving this one for sure.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours black with a finger and a half of caramel colored head. Great head retention and lacing with a foamy ring lingering for a long time. Aroma is molasses, toast, nuts, caramel, and roasted malts. Flavor profile is molasses, oak, toast, nuts, caramel, roasted malts, and toasted marshmallow. Mouth feel is thick, velvety, and creamy - it packs a presence. Overall, a fantastic dark imperial stout that provides a whirlwind of notes, without being over powering or arrogant.     Served in a 12 snifter. Draft. Around 1 year of age on the keg. Reviewed from notes.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2016 vintage poured in a damn wine glass out of sheer respect. I’m not even sure it’s a beer. Just look at the breakdown of barrel components - how did they come up with the mix? Bourbon barrel, wine barrel, new oak barrel, tiny barrels in a giant barrel, barrels that have tumbled down Niagara Falls with brewers in them. And clearly this beer needed bark? And molasses? Unreal.     Rich, creamy, black pour with a sumptuous cardboard-colored head that actually lingers for a long while. A wine glass has never looked so good.    Aroma is spectacular - tobacco, licorice, charred oak, leather, thick plump giant violet-colored grapes that grow on trees instead of vines. It literally smells like the finer things in life.     Taste is so complex and it’s a treat to see how it evolves as the temperature rises. Hard to follow the aroma but the taste picks up right where your senses left off - roasted malt, dark bitter chocolate, oak, tobacco, molasses, bourbony toffee and vanilla, charred bread. Delicious. And the goddamn head is still there!    Feels decadent but not overwhelming - sweet, bitter, smokey, dry. Thick and chewy but also smooth smooth smooth and easy to sip. A truly world class beer.

Pours a pitch black color. The fruity grape and oak notes from the wine barrels are immediately evident in the nose and the vanilla and sweet molasses also come through. Licorice comes through in the nose as the beer warms up. The taste is some sweetness up front that lingers into a roasty and bitter finish. Definitely a more bitter finish than I prefer for this style of beer, but not bad. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied. Overall, a solid imperial stout that I enjoyed. This is definitely a sipper, not something I find easy to drink with the high ABV and extreme roastiness.

A roller coaster of a flavor profile and mouthfeel

I was worried that it would end up a mess, but it wasn't, and I was worried it would smell and taste too boozy, but it didn't, although there was another problem--the beer is much too dry and bitter (and I prefer beers that are dry and bitter). My mouth was left dried, and I ended up throwing a few ounces out, which isn't good when the bomber cost in excess of $20 (way too high). Looked nice, smelled nice, and tasted OK, but for the price I needed it to exceed my expectations, and it certainly didn't.

S -- Coffee, cherry, chocolate, roast, oak, vanilla, vine, bourbon, molasses (verging on generic sweetness).     T -- Follows strongly on the aroma. Coffee, roast, chocolate, vanilla, molasses and oak take the forefront, but I still not the others, save for cherry. Caramel, earthiness, red wine. Roundness. Balance. I went outside and inspected some foundling tomatoes with my girlfriend, and I couldn't help but notice the scent of plants was familiar to the earthiness I noted earlier in my tasting.     F -- Goddamn motor oil, but nicely carbonated. This is what huge stouts should be like, I think -- thick, hard to drink quickly, something that makes me take pause with each sip because I have no other way to drink it.     O -- Clearly a fantastic beer. There might be slightly too much going on, here, as I tried to search for each aspect listed on the bottle. Some were clearer than others, and perhaps those should be focused on. On the other hand, that may produce something too focused, too 1-or-2-noted. I hate licorice, for the record -- every form of it -- but that should be nothing to dissuade you here as I couldn't pick it out. This deserves its very high rating.

The appearance, well, it poured like motor oil and I even heard the "glub glub" sound as it strolls out of the bottle, (did I pour too fast, hmmm...most likely not?). The head is about a finger’s worth of off-white to a nice tan color that lasts for a good minute before dieing and leaving a super nice coating of tan lacing clinging very nicely to the glass. The smell is an almost perfect aroma to any imperial stout anyone could ever want. It goes a little something like this: super nice oaky/woody vanilla, cherry, chocolate, molassess and licorice. There is a slight aftertaste and its kinda woody with a nice dose of lingering molasses and vanilla. The finish is quick, dry and sweet. On the palate, it sat about a medium to heavy. I sure did sip this. This is one not to gulp. Sessionability - ha, no way, man, one and done. ABV is felt. The carbonation is smooth and good for the style and for me. Overall, American Double/Imperial Stout, wow, this practically defines it. Don’t ever pass up on this if you ever see it.

I recall that I've had one bottle since, and unfortunately that review seems to have been lost, but the price has definitely kept me away. Well, that and the fact that I haven't seen it on tap, although I'm sure that would be really expensive as well. And looking at it in that way, maybe buying a full bottle just for myself is a better idea: it's just a dollar an ounce versus probably more at a bar, or not (?), but I can enjoy it peacefully and without interruption, comfortably in my own home for as long as I like ~ or as long as it lasts! I should also note that for my area the price that I got was good, I've seen it for $4 to $6 more at the specialty bottle shops. I'm looking at the label now and it lists quite a bit of ingredients and barrel aging, which I'm not sure existed in 2008. I don't know, I'm not sure, but I thought it was a little more straightforward back then. Anyway, it's completely opaque black in the glass beneath a short head of densely creamy brown froth. It appears to have excellent head retention but I'll check back in on that. The aroma expresses cocoa powder, caramel, coffee, and a soft ashen roastiness. The flavor is much fuller, adding in notes of red berries, red wine, earth & leaves, licorice, burnt sugar, and baker's chocolate. I can see from the few sips I've taken that it leaves some impressive lacing, and the head is still there, but thinner. Ah, there are some hops in the burp! They don't quite come through clearly in the mouth as they've got to fight through the dark malt. With another sip, as it warms and the head dwindles, I find Bourbon and oak, and a bit of moist chocolate cake in the aroma. Is that the vanilla coming through? As it opens up the flavor widens even further as well, showing notes of cherry, black currant, and molasses, and a heavier roastiness with a bit of dark malt acidity. There's a little bit of alcohol in play, although it's pretty clear in the finish, and along with a solid bitterness and oaky dryness it's really bone dry at the end. I can't tell if I like that or not, I mean it's not really sweet up front to begin with. Hmmm... the berry notes do linger nicely though. I wonder how much the wine barrels add to that. I still have a solid surface covering on it, which is pretty amazing. The label lists it at 11.1% ABV but I guess there's enough malt that it's holding up. It's not that carbonated. I guess it was a little higher at first, it's warmed a bit by now, but it's smooth with just a gently tingle across the palate. Medium-full in body I'd say, oily, and it airs up a bit to become fluffy as it warms on the tongue. So is it worth it? Well this last time around I decided to splurge and I also bought a bottle of Boulevard Rye on Rye Sazerac for $15 and a bottle of Brooklyn Cloaking Device for $23.99, so it's in-between the cost of those, and it's pretty good. It's better than a lot of other Imperial stouts, including some of my favorites, so I guess the answer is yes. Ahh haa, as an aside I've just remembered a good little laugh about my first encounter with The Abyss. While I was in Toronado a group of guys in suits came in to visit, and one of the older guys came over to me and asked what I was drinking, and what I'd had on tap that I'd recommend. I was drinking a Ballast Point beer at the moment which I told him was OK, but that I'd recommend the Abyss. That was, of course, not the response he was hoping for as he was the head guy from PALM at the moment, visiting the U.S. because they'd just released it on draft. He told me I had to try the Rodenbach and bought one for me, although I told him that I'd already had it, that I was a big fan, and even more fond of the Alexander which they didn't make anymore to which he responded "Oh, yes, the Alexander, everyone keeps asking for us to bring that back." At that point I told him that I would like to try the PALM but I guess it's one free beer per customer, and he shook my hand and gave me his card and told me to try it and he and his buddies walked out (they'd probably already settles up). Still, my most memorable moment of the day (apart from seeing Nick Cave around the corner as he was playing later that night) was the Abyss.

I don't think it was the Obsidian Stout base beer, since that has a bit more chocolate flavor and isn't quite as bitter on its own. This one was definitely full value for the 11% ABV, but I didn't quite get the range of flavors that should have been developed by the barrel aging. I got more of the bourbon taste than anything. Still good, but not quite as good as I hoped.

Murky black in color with pretty thick dark tan head as an inviting showcase, the head retains itself with good retention before gradually collapsing to a long-lasting bubble sheet on the surface and leaving lots lacing patch and spot on the glass-side.    The aroma is infused with mellow yet aggressive barrel-aged Imperial Stout character. It harmoniously discloses the notes of coffee, chocolate, roasted, dark bread, dough, and charred nut as a typical Stout aroma. There comes closely thereafter the depth of the other characters like molasses, licorice, vanilla, cherry, oaky, winy, woody, spicy alcohol, grape, and fruity zest.    It is nearly flawless through the palate sensation. Kicking off with fruity, grape-ish and winy notes, then comes the rich malty goodness of coffee, chocolate, roasted, dark bread, dough, and charred nut just exactly like the aroma. The addition of molasses, licorice, cherry, and vanilla making it more complex and tasty together with notes of barrel aging of spicy alcohol, woody, oaky, and winy taste, the end and aftertaste is lasting with roasted and BA character.    Full body with some bold touch and creamy smooth mouthfeel through the palate, the feeling is just right with suitable amount of crispness and moderate carbonation to carry all the things well. Finish is pleasantly dry.    “The Abyss”, it is big and bold yet hefty and intense. Anyway, it is also delicate yet very tasty through its sheer complexity but pretty easy to enjoy with and excellent for sipping. Everything is very well harmonized and categorized. It is truly a masterpiece.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 This review is for the 2015 bottling of Deschutes Brewery The Abyss an American Double / Imperial Stout     It features a very robust ABV of 12.20% and a nicely balanced 65 IBU.    It's got a long head on the pour, a bit bitter on the first sip, but after letting it sit a few minutes it mellowed a bit with a rich mouthful of licorice, scotch, with a hint of dark chocolate followed by a long finish.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Purchased a 22oz bottle from Tavour. I waited a long time to crack this baby open. Finally found a friend willing to share. Totally worth the wait!  Poured onto the glass I loved what I saw. Pours a viscous dark brown that looks jet black in the glass. A fantastic creamy foam mocha head rises up invitingly, it's enticing and a predictor of the richness in aroma and flavor that is to follow.  In the nose there is chocolate fudge sweetness. It is redolent of a rich and decadent dessert. Playing a supporting role is an aroma of roasted malt, coffee, oak and dark fruit, of which cherries will figure prominently in moments to come.  In the mouth there is just so much going on, it is that complex; even more so than the aroma. I'll start straight away with the mouthfeel, body and drinkability. It is fluffy, velvety, creamy and smooth. It fills the mouth like soft clouds, floating and weightless. Yet, the dichotomy of this is that the body is full, robust and sipper despite the fact that it's drinkability is dangerously high. Does this thing even have alcohol? I didn't notice it until 3/4 of the way through. Whoa!!  But this doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of how dynamic and complex this brew is. At the beginning, the elixir coats the mouth with rich chocolate fudge, dark caramel and creamy sweetness; a true dessert treat. Yet, there is so much more to it. The roasted malts and espresso tones add support. However, where this stout truly becomes special is with the woody, oak like, earthy, tree bark tones which add a nice bitterness. In addition, there is a moderate but bold serving of grassy hops that compliments things and adds a lingering aftertaste. The cherry on top-so to speak- is that the bark comes from a cherry tree; very apropos because there is a slight cherry tartness that that adds a light counterpoint to the full bodied chocolate darkness. Notes of licorice are present, as well as a bourbon, which incidentally sneaks up on you.  Wow! I feel that as I gain more experience in reviewing beer, I tend to be more critical and shed the superlatives of my earlier reviews. Yet, this might quite possibly be the best imperial stout I have ever had!

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Found (on tap!) at Red, Wine and Brew in Mentor, Ohio earlier this evening. Cost of $8 for a tulip glass.   A: Head is moderate brown with an absolute motor oil body underneath. Curtain like lacing left on the inside of the tulip glass with repeated sips. Look cannot be improved upon.  S: Somewhat distant which is true to the style but I cannot rate it with the highest rating since it was not very distinctive.  T: Simply great. Dark roast malt, chocolate notes. This may be THE example of a RIS. Wow!  F: This is an absolute asset of this beer. Smooth, silky smooth. Oh yeah. Late in the taste is a grainy aspect but this is top feel.  O: World class Russian Imperial Stout. Such a treat to find it here on tap (who knew?)

Taste is cocoa, hint of vanilla, smoke/char with a lot of burnt notes, acidity, sweet malts and a somewhat flat finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, minimal effervescence, well hidden abv. A somewhat powdery quality.  Overall, interesting – my palate isn’t refined enough to note all the differing elements. Not bad – but I wouldn’t go out of my way to find this. There are better (and cheaper) barrel aged stouts

After a decade of cellaring I was worried about oxidation but glad it was covered in a thick wax coating. All I can say is this beer has not only held up, but can more than hold its own against the much hyped FO's and Assassins that it paved the way for. A lot of breweries claim their big Imp Stouts will age well but then fail to live up to expectations due to infections and oxidation issues. Anyone claiming the beer can be cellared should use wax (not foils...looking at you Firestone Walker Anniversary).     The currant/ molasses sweetness melds perfectly with the vanilla oak backbone. This is an old favorite that can still teach a thing or two to the new kids on the block. Excellent job Deschutes. Glad I still have one more 2007 that I look forward to drinking 5 years down the road.

The head is a dark tan or light brown, fades pretty quickly. The lacing is small bubbled and minimal.    S - First and foremost is barrel and booze. The wood is strong, the vanilla and alcohol warmth. Roasted malt and char underpin, but the bourbon notes dominate.    T - Interesting beer, with a strong core of chocolate, brownie batter, and boozy warmth. Highlights of tobacco and leather, coffee acidity and dark molasses. An earthy element, and cocoa nibs come through for the bitter counter to the sweet open.    M - Moderate body, full on the tongue but not cloying or burdensome. The warmth of the booze helps scrub the tongue, and the dry finish also helps. Overall, the finish leaves the tongue a bit parched, making me want to dive back in.    O - The freshly tapped Abyss offered more layering, while the integrated experience of the 2014 pour in 2018 produced a well-built and integrated experience. Both have punch, and I'd recommend both approaches for those who dig Bourbon-forward aged stouts.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 2016 vintage, opened 2017-03-25.    The stout looks amazing. Inky black base with tons of lacing on the glass. The head lasts forever. It has some large bubbles clinging to the side and a film of tiny bubbles covering the surface.    The smell is dominated by the dry, vinous quality of the red-wine barrels. It is oaky and a little bit tart-smelling. There is some dark fudge, vanilla, and oak in the background, mingling with chocolatey roasted malt. It also has a hint of that European dark-chocolate malt scent that you get from a stout from Mikkeller or To Ol.    The flavor follows through with similar flavors under a layer of dry bitterness. There is a ton of oak and some spice similar to rye. It reminds me a lot of dark chocolate and red wine.    The feel is quite good. It could be a bit more viscous, but it has a nice tongue-coating density without a tooth-rotting sugar feeling.    I find the Abyss to be a bit over-hopped. It's a bit too floral and bitter for a barrel-aged stout, at least to my taste. On draft, it comes out more chocolatey, but from the bombers, I always find it to be awfully bitter. I wish they would tone down the hops a bit and let it spend a little more time in bourbon barrels. It doesn't have the boozy bourbon sweetness of something like BCBS nor the dense, dark-chocolate and red-wine character of something like cabernet-barrel-aged Laika imperial stout from Straight to Ale.

Sits in the glass heavily, it's own inertia exaggerated by the sheer magnitude of the beer.     Smells like dried wood and sweet molasses, with some raisin and a bit of alcohol coming through.   The taste is sweet and dark, with oak and smoky sugar coming through prominently. Hints of vanilla and licorice, with just a hint of raisin and that warm boozy finish.   Body is sticky and smooth. Full without being even slightly cloying. I think the loads of alcohol keep the body acceptably quaffable for such a huge stout.     Overall: mmmmmmmmm....thanks Canada craft club. You guys rock.

Nose began with bourbon and dark fruit, them meandered towards coffee and sort of stays there.    Taste begins with coffee, then invites bourbon and molasses in. The coffee element lends a touch of smokiness that mingles with dark chocolate, which contributes something of a sweet yet ashy finish.    Silky smooth body, very smooth. Maybe just a little more thin than I had expected, but no real issues with it. Alcohol is masterfully hidden, it's a touch dry, and the aftertaste is a well balanced bitter and sweet.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 This is one of my favorite beers!! It is a truly unique imperial stout. I give it a 5 out of 5. I learned with the 2014 version (where I was fortunate enough to get an entire case) to let it age as it has a bitter taste that disappears with age. That said, I had the 2015 version draught at 600 degrees and it was quite awesome without the aging. I picked up a couple of 2016 today, so I thought I would go ahead and drink one of the 2015 bottles.    After aging, the licorice comes to the foreground more, and the vanilla/cherry bark ease up to be more balanced. I don't really directly pick up the wine barrel here with the depth of complex flavors, but do in Collage 2 where it has been blended with other beers. I like the 2015 better than the 2014 and can't really explain why... something from the abyss of complex flavor!

Nose leans toward the coffee and licoric earns less toasty notes. wood and vanilla as well. Taste, however, is much larger. Really well incorporated for the ABV and all the stuff thrown in. Big stout flavors mix with the barrel and adjuncts without anything being weird, cloying, off balance, or overly boozy. Long finish turns a bit more woody as it dries, which isn't quite as nice. Overall, a big beer with a lot going on that would go well in front of a fire during winter, but not something you'd want regularly.

look: 4.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Like some have said, when it was very limited they did a better job. Now that they probably produce something like 10 times the number of barrels as the original batch in 2006, it does feel/taste a bit generic to me. Doesn't have the overall complexity or full-bodied mouth feel you might get with something like a Black Tuesday or Speedway (and variances). I don't really care too much for this beer and agree with The Bros on this for the lower rating.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Had a 2013 and 2014 vintage side by side. Both had a roasted malt flavor with a slick, rich body. The 2014 packed a bit more heat. I suspect another year would also mellow it. Just the standard-bearer for imp stouts for many years. A great beer.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured a thick, jet black color with about a finger of tan head. Smells of cherries, malts, molasses, hints of bourbon, oak, and a little red wine. Tastes follow with the nose primarily, certainly takes a little warming up to draw them out. Comes out to a complex brew, sweeter cherry and molasses flavors, oak, and a little red wine flavor towards the end. Dry finish and tends to linger a little on the tongue. This is an interesting brew, one that I find isn't quite for idlying drinking but more for sitting and enjoying, perhaps with a friend or two, but with a little more focus on the beer. Tasty, good stuff that holds up well to some more recent stouts.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Poured into a snifter and said "Oooouuhh, that's pretty"     Appearance: Dark with no light penetration, head is slightly red with a nice mingling lace.    Smell: Coco, toffee, cookie, vanilla.    Taste: Just like my all time favorite Collage 2, Deschutes nailed it! Every aspect of a good imperial is there so I won't get into that too much. Wine at the tip of the tounge. Pruney, dried rasins and cherries. Vanilla and toffee. Very smokey.    Texture: Slick and chewy. Lingers quite a bit.    Seems like Oregon is on top of the stout game. You Oregonians make me feel all warm n fuzzy inside hahaha. Deschutes, you folks haven't failed me. Cheers!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours solid black with a rich leathery head and sticky lacing. Get very nice notes of oak, licorice, malt, smoke, and char. The taste is very very very good, this is just a sweet beer. The taste of the oak and blended barrels is so nice, I am getting a very full bodied stout but its not overwhelming at all. Tastes of malty smoke, whiskey/wine, licorice, and some dark chocolate. This beer is so nice, it evolves with each sip, I have to let it warm to see what flavors come from room temps. Very happy with this beer, just a great stout and what a beer should be.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 Very nice black pour with a tight creamy head.    Aroma of cedar, vanilla, cherries, and chocolate. Slight metal aroma.    Flavor is all roast. Burnt/roast malts, coffee, blood, and light cocoa.     Feel is roasty too, very dry.    Overall just way too metallic and one noted with the roast. No bueno.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 2016, Pours black. It smells complex - blackstrap molasses, licorice, coffee, dried fruit. The flavor is just about perfect, the various components combining so that nothing stands out but it all works together. Not too heavy either. Very smooth and creamy.   When I tasted the 2015 a year ago, I thought "This is Stout perfection". I expected to be disappointed this time around but I was not. It is still Stout perfection.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Poured a month past the Best After date. Thick, dark brown pour with decent head that lasts a bit.    Cold, the nose is sweet, malty, chocolatey, a hint of licorice. As it warms, the various oaky characters come out more, though distinguishing between the regular oak, wine oak, and bourbon oak is beyond me. Bourbon stands out the most, and I'm really not getting any wine.    Taste is much the same. A bit sweet with the malts and molasses. Oaky flavor and tannic body shine though, again, as it warms to room temperature. Slightly bitter finish resembles roasted malts and ashy oak.    In a world full of big, barrel-aged imperial stouts, I'm not sure this adds anything new. I'm excited to try the different variants that came out to compare them, but I won't bother seeking this out again if there are other similar options available. There's so many different elements and ingredients in here, but most of them don't allow themselves to be detected in any meaningful way. Molasses? Barely. Vanilla? Not really. Cherry bark? With 3 different kinds of oak in here, it's hard to believe there was even a point. Overall, well made, but over-engineered.

Smell: Those oak barrels. And the pinot. No bourbon.  Taste: Everything in the nose repeats itself on the palate.  Feel: Nothing noteworthy. Wish it were thicker.  Overall: If you like oak, you may like this beer. Tastes like an experiment gone awry ($16.99 should be better than this). 22 ounces of disappointment poured into a tulip glass.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 A very special brew for my 1500th review... On my 40th Birthday...    L - Slightly more than two fingers worth of tightly packed dark brown froth with a few medium sized bubbles mixed in... A slow but actively receding lop sided head that leaves bits of whipped lacing clinging to the sides of the glass... Over very solid and respectable retention... Once receded, there is a lopsided veil of lacing and thin to moderate collar... The Abyss is a very proper names in terms of color as this one is black ink through and through, perhaps with some aubergine notes when back lit... Sheets of lacing cling to the glass after each and every sip... World class appearance...     S - A big robust nose with lots to take in upon first whiff... The first thing to really cut through is the black strap molasses which is sweet and inviting... Next come a mix of sweet milk chocolate and brownie batter... Hints of soy sauce and licorice are next... These all sit atop vinous wine and oaky notes... Dark fruits... Jelly beans... Some faint roasted malts as well... A complex nose with oodles of depth and character... Exceptional...     T - The palate is ever bit as interesting as the aroma would suggest... All of the expected stout characters are present... Dark chocolate... Molasses... Soy sauce... Licorice... Brownie batter... Picking notes of the virgin oak... The tannin notes from the wine barrels really sines through on the finish and adds a ton of depth and richness... Never detected much of the bourbon barrels, but that's okay... This one a marvelous as is...     F - On the fuller side of medium bodied... Smooth... Slightly seek... Starts lush... Slightly chewy... Finishes with a surprising dryness... A bit of a roll coaster ride that takes several sips to get accustomed to.. Overall each sip is an experience... The words I'm left with after several sips is delicate and charming... Again, world class...    O - Oh boy, this one was worth the close the decade wait... I finally acquire this one (2014 reserve) and have let it sit for a few years... Truly exceptional and world class in all facets... This one is worth all of the hype and then some... I'm forever fascinated by Deschutes "big beers," all of which live up to and exceed expectations...     With that I bid beer reviewing farewell... I may add scores from time to time, but my life as a detailed reviewer is coming to a close... Cheers to everyone and I'm glad I went out in style with this one... Remember - Great minds drink alike...

Slight cappuccino head but dissolved pretty quickly.     S= All my fav things. Bit of coffee, chocolate, licorice, maple, molasses. I just love smelling this beer. Quite the aroma and gets better if it starts to room temp.     T= Paird this with a pork chop marinated with a pear balsamic and side of sautéed asparagus. I highly suggest! Definitely brought out all the flavor of this beer. Easy to drink with a meal and not filling as you would think. The beer gets better as you let it warm up. Not sure if I'd drink it without being in the fridge but definitely gets more full as it sets out.     F= Not thick and full as you'd might expect. Very drinkable. I'd prefer it just a little more syrupy if I were to use it as a dessert beer which it very well could be if it felt more filling.     Overall= Can't get enough of it honestly. I stumbled upon it in my own. 2015 bottle. My local place had about 6 of them left over...so I bought them all without hesitation. A little pricey considering Goose Island Bourbon County Stout is stronger and a few dollars cheaper but this fills the void of not being able to get that beer as often as I could when I lived in Chicago. Definitely on my look out list for next year! Well done Deschutes!    ****UPDATE****  It’s 2018, November 3. I’ve git a few years on this guy and I’m almost teary eyed that it’s now been opened. Holy Santa clays shit did this age well. Smells like a cherry tootsie pop, tastes of super woody oak followed by licorice, vanilla and then comes that sweet molasses. I can’t believe I got 3 years aged on it. Anymore and I think it would be a little cloying. 12.2%

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 2015 Vintage, best after 12/8/16 - Pours black as a starless night - pitch black. World class head volume, retention and lacing. For a barrel aged beer, the head characteristics are uber world class.    World class complex nose of chocolate, light char, molasses, dark fruit (plum, raisin, currant), anise and hints of vanilla. Bourbon is present but not overwhelming nor subtle - just the right balance to influence.    Heavy medium body that is smooth but falls just short of creamy, which is not surprising for 12.2% ABV. Carbonation is light yet yields a nice somewhat prickly finish. Carbonation / body balance is outstanding, considering barrel aging.    The flavor profile is world class but many flavors are not as pronounced as in the nose. It begins with a notes of roast and char which flow into a nice oak accent coupled with anise. The middle is where this beer hits its stride. A rich semi-sweet burst of dark chocolate yields to molasses producing a sweet base. Over the base, dark fruit emerges (mostly plum and currant) that slowly allows light vanilla notes to surface. Once the vanilla arrives, a bit of astringent alcohol becomes uncovered along with a bit of heat. Surprisingly, sweet chocolate takes center stage as the alcoholic burn intensifies and flows through the finish. I strongly suggest that you step into The Abyss - often!   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75 Bottled December 2016. Been wanting to try this for awhile. Pitch black with a dark tan head that quickly fades to wispy ring. Smells of strong bourbon, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, and cherries. Wow, thats smooth. Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, long coffee and vanilla finish. Wine barrel flavors come into play in the aftertaste as well. Where did the abv go? Silky mouthfeel with little to no carbonation. Amazing beer.

A violent pour yielded a huge dark khaki head; a thick curtain of lace.     Black licorice, fresh earth & plum notes in the nose.     Thick mouthfeel.     Black licorice & plum flavors up front; fresh earth & a faint metallic note on the finish. Bitter bakers chocolate notes emerged as this warmed. Punishing & not very rewarding. Tread lighly.

Ink - black, thIck, viscous pour with light head and lacing. Upon pouring, aroma of the blackstrap molasses comes right across the table. Taste is rich and complex. The bitterness unique to the blackstrap comes out right in front of the roasted malts and then the brewer's licorice finish. How they apportion such strongly flavored ingredients, I have no clue...but Deschutes seems to have mastered the art. Sip it slowly and enjoy the experience.

Barrel notes bring some earthy wood with an emphasis on the red wine barrel, that adds elements of dark berries and vinous red wine. Char and raisin close it out    T- opens up with charred roasted malt, along with chocolate and a bit of espresso, followed by notes of dark cherry, licorice & molasses. Woody oak, followed by some vinous dark grape notes. Finishes with dark fruit and charred malt     M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that turns into a silky smooth finish, abv hidden well    O- most of the elements are identifiable throughout, but I can't help but think that this one may actually improve with age.

Notes of pipe tobacco smokiness, tar, and bourbon barrels as well. Chocolatey and sweet, smells delicious.    On the tongue, Big vanilla beans, bourbon barrels, dark chocolate, caramel, sweet like chocolate milk, absolutely delicious.    Feels thick but foamy, like hot chocolate with whipped cream.    This was the 2015 release, drank on January 6th, 2016. I got it online, drinking it in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Awesome brew. Couldn't find in while in the US, so I was stoked to find it in Asia.

Taste is so multi-layered char, dark cherry, currant, baker's chocolate, black licorice, and plenty of oak. Full bodied, nice combination of roastiness, char, and oaky sweetness, with medium low carbonation. About as complex an American stout as I have had. Just a beautiful and delicious beer.

Burnt sugars and a roasty grain and malt. Medium body and sugars lay tacky on the lips. Only drawback for me is that it's more bitter than I care for but overall a notch above the norm.

Thin, jet black, coca-cola looking. Little head. Very thick however on the side of the glass with very dispersed lacing. It clings to the side of the snifter like wet paint and just doesn't all run back down. It looks very sticky.    S - burnt sugar and molasses. Dark fruit and cherries. Smoke of burnt wet wood. Sweet cream/vanilla. Red wine. Minimal alcohol.    T - Wow. Incredible amount going on. I honestly can't even describe it after the first sip it's so complex. It tasted charred, but not burnt. Tons of light roast malt and chocolate flavor. Mild fruitiness. Faint vanilla and oak. The flavors are extremely strong and I'm finding my palate overcome between sips and it hard to recognize new flavors. If it has a flaw it's for being overly roasty and hard to discern the many other nuances underneath the charred flavor.    M - Great here. Not the fudgiest BA beer I've had but it's definitely not thin. Very creamy and chewy. Definitely filling. Overall far above average mouthfeel.    O - Very impressed. $22/bomber impressed I'm not sure. I'd probably buy one a year at that cost but if it were in the $15 range I'd scoop it up without hesitation.    Edit - dropped taste and overall from 4.5 to 4.25 due to the beer becoming overwhelming with roast flavor and less enjoyable towards the finish. A 12oz would have been perfect but a bomber of this is difficult and nothing but burnt sugar and char after a while. I honestly considered drain pouring at 60% and drinking something else instead but the cost of the bottle has me sticking it out.    Edit. Tried one fresher on 2-12-17 (bottled December 2016). I don't get it. I really hate this. It's overwhelmingly burnt and charred. Dropped taste and overall to 3.5 from 4.25 each.     I'll try this one more time, but that won't be until I cellar one for 3+ years to hopefully mute some of this bitter roast and maybe I'll understand the regard for this beer.

At that time it was still about 2 months away from the enjoy after date but I needed something I hasn't tried yet while up north in michigan on a cold fall evening around a fire and this was perfect. Flavors of vanilla, bourbon and maple and a hint of liquorice. Will get again next year.

Pours utterly black with a thin cap of creamy dark brown head that leaves clouds and blotches of dripping lace as it recedes.    Smells of dark chocolate, black cherries, moist tobacco, rich molasses, roasted marshmallow and wood smoke, bourbon whiskey, black licorice and gentle red wine tartness. Outstanding.    Tastes of rich dark chocolate drizzled over cherries and raisins, toasted brown sugar, aged bourbon, more smoky marshmallow and tobacco and more sexy red wine tartness.     Feels soft and smooth. Full bodied with creamy carbonation. Finishes dry with hardly a hint of alcohol.    Verdict: Vigorously recommended. Good to an almost staggering degree.

Bottle actually says best after 12/08/16, so this is a little early. Strange since i've had the bottle for 10 months or so.    LOOK: dark black, really like an abyss, medium light brown head; josseling the glass reinvigorated a nice frothy top.  AROMA: malt, tobacco, coffee, chocolate, oak. Also hay, grass,   TASTE: vanilla and chocolate, but so much more...wood, tobacco and smoke in the aftertaste are really interesting,   FEEL: amazingly thin, but full bodied...not sure if that makes sense, but this beer feels unique.        **

From what I can remember there was not much change in my opinion on this beer over that time. Absolutely black ink in color with almost no carbonation. Thick, oily, smelled awesome with molasses and cherry hitting my nose predominately. Very warming mouthfeel soon extended to the brain. Love this beer, a sipping beer - where is my cigar? This is a world classic, very complex notes as it warms. Highly recommend.

Looks so dark it's like an Abyss.    Smells of charred grains, brown sugar, molasses, black licorice, vanilla, bourbon, oak, dark fruit and toffee and/or burnt coffee grinds. Simple, malty and wonderful to inhale - really a treat to breathe in.    Tastes like it smells with charred grains, brown sugar, molasses, black licorice, vanilla, bourbon, oak, dark fruit especially cherry and rotting pear, smoked wood, light piney hops and toffee and/or burnt coffee grinds. Wow, this is so complex, an amazing display of dragging different flavors out of smoked malts and bourbon barrels. This lived up the hype and was a lot smoother than it should be at 11.1% ABV (listed on bottle).    Mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth with mild carbonation, a medium body with mild bitterness and a nice finish that's smoky, malty and quite flavorful with nice vanilla and bourbon barrel notes. An outstanding beer, nothing more to say except I can't wait to drink more of it. Huge thanks to "Boccu" for sharing this bomber.    7/1/2017: Had it on tap at Brü Craft & Wurst in Philly and it was outstanding. It poured and looked better on tap, with color as black as an Abyss and a brown head that lasted longer than expected. Exceptionally smooth, it was full of chocolate, roasted malts, cocoa powder, molasses, faint licorice, coffee grinds and a lot of smoky and chocolate sweetness and it faded with a cocoa powder finish and no traces of the booze. Raised the "Look" score from 4 to 4.25 and the "Taste" score from 4.75 to 5, which bumped up the "Rating" score from 4.72 to 4.84. Seek this out!

T- Sweet dark fruits, but ends with a sharp smokey/ roasty bit.   F- Medium thick... could be a bit thicker  O- Nice stout with both sweet and roastie bits. Reminds me a bit of dark lord with all the sweet fruit, but has a bit more balance with the bite. Bit is a bit too sharp for me.

Notes of whiskey barrel and anise. Taste is super complex. Anise, vanilla, cocoa, whiskey barrel and wine barrel. It's as boozy as expected at 12.2% but it's fairly smooth, save for a bit of a burn on the mid tongue. This was an awesome birthday present for myself. Too bad I have to drive 3 hours to find it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Cellared 2 yrs 8 mos.     Poured into a tulip    Appearance: thick, silky when poured. Luxurious. Black-Onyx, void of light, even when held directly to light.     Aroma: oak and bittersweet chocolate. Very little alcohol detectable. A bit of raisin (rum raisin?). No bourbon though.    Flavor: very enjoyable, but I fear that the 2 yrs 8 mos in the cellar have muted many of the flavors. No one flavor stands out. No dominant vanilla, licorice, bourbon etc. Instead all flavors are blended together. Quite enjoyable, just not what it might have been.     Mouthfeel: thick and chewy. A meal by itself. Perfectly suited to carry its 11% abv.     Overall: this is a quality beer, but it does live up to the hype or its price tag. Expectation of this beer exceeded what was delivered. Enjoyable nonetheless, but no more so than more readily available beers at much lower cost. There is a sizable disconnect between the beer's hype and the actual beer. Let me state again, I enjoyed this beer, but I was underwhelmed.

Khaki colored head with nice sticky lacing. Fades pretty quick to nothing. In the aroma, nice amount of creamy chocolate, vanilla, toffee. Bourbon and a nice heavy dose of dark cherries come though even more as it warms. Taste is amazing. First of all, the creamy milk chocolate is the most dominate note. But the undertones behind it are the highlight here: toffee, vanilla, cherries, and oak. Bourbon is very subtle, so is the wine barrels. But just enough to take notice. Mouthfeel is thick, palate coating for sure. Little carbonation. Overall definitely let this one warm, as it definitely changes to a different more attractive beer. Very solid, and very accessible. Highly recommended.

Poured black as night, with a beautiful 2 finger deep caramel red, with frothy head, that dissipates to a little ring. spotty lacing.     S-wow. Smells like chocolate cake, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, faint cherries and sweet malts. Very different aroma from other barrel aged beers. Flavors galore.     T-Bourbon, chocolate, cherry, vanilla, molasses. The licorice is faint, but you can taste the presence of the wine barrels. Very smooth and pleasant, for 12%. Very drinkable. Very clean beer here. I could drink one of these every night before bed.     M-Medium bodied with nice carbonation. The wine barrel really shines in this mouth. Nice, clean and semi dry finish.     First time popping an Abyss. Definetly won't be my last. Very good beer!

I had the 2012 on draft at the Portland restaurant/taphouse. It was jet black with a beautiful frothy mocha head. Chocolate is prominant in the nose with undertones of vanilla and coffee. Chocolate is completely dominant in the taste and most other adjuncts had smoothed out at this point leaving an a well balanced roasted/slightly sweet stout with an even coating feel. No astringency or hot alcohol character. Glad I was also able to pick up a bottle of cognac aged as well!

Like, nothing - no highlights. Didn't even know beer could do that? Two fingers of tan head on top, with some light lacing as the beer drains. Nose is a touch milder than I'd expect. Roasted malt, some light coffee, dried fruit, lots of sweet chocolate and bourbon. Very nice. Flavor is incredible. Monster roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. Some cookies, prunes. Big bourbon, and alcohol shows up as just a touch of heat at the back of the mouth - nicely hidden, especially given the ABV. A fantastic beer, huge flavors, one to get your hands on. Would be great to put down for a few years and see what happened to it.

I go to Darkness Eve every October and it is usually on tap, and it's always great! This specific version is the bottled 2015 vintage.    A - Pitch black pour with the most gorgeous dark tan head I've ever seen. Head lingers for well in excess of 30 minutes!     S - The aroma is subtle, but complex: dark chocolate and an interesting blend of barrel characteristics. Black licorice and some earthy hops also make an appearance.    T - Very unique blend of barrels here. The stout oak shines through above all, and the specific bourbon / wine barrels add a hint of sweetness as well - just right, but far from too sweet. Nice roasty, chocolate-marshmallow characteristics. Vanilla, and the slightest bit of anise, molasses and caramel. You could spend hours marvelling at the flavors of this beer!     F - Feels like floating on smooth pillowy marshmallow clouds, with a bit of dark chocolate lightning and licorice thunder thrown in for good measure.     O - Beers of this magnitude are quite rare. A lot of effort went into this beer, but it was entirely worth it! Mad respect to Deschutes. However I will say that if you don't like dry stouts, stay away from this beer. Go drink Bourbon County or something.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 A - nice pitch black beer with a mocha head that sticks and leaves a nice lacing  S - big dark chocolate, roasted marshmallow, vanilla, light bourbon, toasted oak that's mellowed out.   T - dark chocolate, red wine, toasted oak, burnt marshmallow, roasty malts, little bit of light bourbon in there, dark tart cherry  M - super heavy mouthfeel, alcohol present but so appropriate, aftertaste is dark roasty malts, red wine, oak  O - this is one of those beers I've had to have a few times to get accustomed to and realize how awesome it is, it also ages ridiculously well, I've had it brand new and now with the usual release being dec-Feb I'm guessing this is 6-8 months out which in my experience rounds big stouts out and can give them a little more depth. This one was more of a roasty dark malts bomb at first but now the barrel aging is really starting to come out. Great beer. I need to stock up at my usual bottle shop.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 A: Gorgeous. Deep black body with a reasonable dark brown head. Big chocolate-brown bubbles stream up after the pour. Head stuck around for a while before receding almost completely, leaving a tiny wispy brown circle on the edge of the beer. Lacing is ample and sticky.     S: Complex. Booze and barrel hits the nose first. Heavy liquorish, coffee, and chocolate all come out next. Molasses and dark malts are there as well. Smells roasted, thick, and sticky. Not as in-your-face as barrel aged Rasputin or BCBS, but still a strong and complex nose.    T:Liquorish and barrel dominate. Lots of the vanilla-wood-booze character you'd expect from a beer of this style. Barrel manages to be present without dominating. This beer does a superb job of balancing barrel flavors against stout flavors. Strong malt backbone props everything up. Lots of thick and sticky roasted malts remind me a bit of Ten Fidy. Finish is lasting bitterness. You can almost feel your throat pucker from the coffee and hop tones. Aftertaste is smooth cigar tobacco, malt, and bitter coffee. As it warms, molasses rises to the front of the profile. Wonderful.    M: Smooth and creamy, but still with some decent carbonation. Sticky, resinous, and rich. Fantastic.     O: A superb beer. So complex, and yet so drinkable. A fantastic model for what a barrel aged stout should be.

Both are very soy saucy and strong black licorice. There's some barrel to the flavor, but the other off malty flavors just take this beer way off point IMO.   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 This was recommended to me by the store beer guy. I have 2 more in my fridge, a 2014 and a 2015 version. Very nice tasting stout with many flavors. I liked the subtle bourbon taste over the more aggressive bourbon stouts. Great dark color with creamy head and goes down smooth. Will get a 2016 and have one of the older ones in the fall.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Vintage 2013. I sat on this for a couple of years.    There's a big burst of foam on my pour into a small snifter. Whatever the aging has done, it hasn't reduced the carbonation.    This beer is mellow, smooth, deep, rich, and incredibly complex, if that makes any sense. I get licorice, I get the wine barrels, I get tobacco and molasses, and some raisins. It's almost over the top in the number of different flavors in the mix, but then you realize it's really quite well balanced, and nothing dominates. For a beer that has seen bourbon barrels, the bourbon is pretty much in the background. I love BBA stouts, but this one is so much more than that. It's really almost in a class by itself, or maybe it's somewhere in between an Impy Stout and a Quad.    I can't actually say what the aging did, because I'm sitting on my newer Abyss bottles. It is the kind of beer that rewards patience.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Vintage 2015, best after 12/08/16, per bottle. Why wait for that. Never tried this one.   Stout glass pour: rich black with rust head that settles to leave delicate lacing.   Rich body.   Aroma is subtle and complex, with hints of rich chocolate, licorice, cherry, and some vanilla, all encapsuled in a barrel aroma where the wine barrel really stands out so as to disallow stronger bourbon notes from overpowering the aroma.   Flavor is dark cocoa and molasses up front, and then evolves into licorice but without too much burn, smokey-sweet, pie-crusted malts, hops then barrel burn finish. Such a complex imperial stout. The "it" factor is about here for me as far as this style goes. The longer it warms and the farther in between sips, the more the licorice stays.   Lives up to the reputation.   For those who dislike licorice, or hops lurking in their big stouts, it may not be as big a hit.   I normally don't like hops lurking in there to taste, but the execution here is terrific.   Mouthfeel is medium-full, chewy.   What would age do? Probably good things.

I kept forgetting about this beer in the back of my fridge, and I'm glad that I did. Now, I have never had it fresh so I have nothing to compare it to, but this beer really impressed me. Very complex and unique. Pours a very dark brown with just a bit of tan head. Lots of oak on the nose, as well as chocolate and a bit of red wine. Taste starts like a typical stout. Chocolate and coffee followed by some cherry notes, then you get hit with the Pinot barrels, and a touch of vanilla towards the end. Feel is just average, if not slightly thin for a BA stout. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer from Deschutes. I think this would be more highly regarded it wasn't so widely available, and dismissed by some because they can't sit on it for the appropriate amount of time.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.25 Thanks, Xenoreactive!    The aroma brings plenty of woodsy dark chocolate. Licorice shows up, as does a gentle hoppiness. My problem here is, while a solid nose, is overly muddled and underdeveloped. Flavor follows the nose. I do get a nice opening sensation of cherry wood to go with the dark chocolate notes. The back end is awash with piny hops, roast, and licorice. Seems muddled, complicated, and incoherent, hampering my enjoyment. On the other hand, I really enjoy the feel - the feel is dry finishing yet rich, warming, and palate coating. Gentle carbonation aids the easy drinking nature. Not particularly impressed with this - maybe it's too young? I respect Deschutes for telling you to age this a year, though; this should integrate more with age.    3.36/5: One confusing abyss

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Pours opaque black with some oil-coloured rimming. The yellowish head settles after a minute or so.    The wall of aroma is the real kicker here – I'd like it consolidated into a black candle to be lit at my funeral. All at once, cigars swirl around dense brioche, molasses, vanilla, oak, booze-soaked raisins, earth, chocolate, and dark caramel. The taste follows the nose, albeit in Willy Wonka-esque layers. The bourbon gives way to chocolate, then to yeasty bread, burnt sugar, coffee and vanilla bean; then comes spice, cherries, wine, and a crisp, hoppy finish that rounds off the decadence. I can't pick up on some of the advertised licorice notes, and I would prefer a bigger hit from the barrels, but the complexity on display is astounding all the same, and always begs another sip.    Mouthfeel is smooth and not too thick, striking what I suppose is a necessary balance between the variety of flavours on display. Carbonation props up the fruitiness, but may occasionally mask some of the smoother notes. That's a nitpick, really - who's having the last tipple?

Poured into a trillium snifter, appearance is black with a nice mocha head, sticks around a bit.     Wow nose absolutely pops out at you! molasses, dark malts, oak, cherry, licorice, very light funkiness from the wine barrels I assume.     On the palate its sticky sweet molasses, rich burnt malts, vanilla. As it warms getting some licorice and dark fruit, almost no booze... and I was worried about drinking this fresh because others have described it as being hot!     before trading for this beer I read quite a few reviews saying the feel is a bit thin, but I would only say that if I was being extremely picky…. thinner than only the most full bodied stouts – but by no means thin and honestly I think it coats nicely and is silky and thick.     Overall I thought this was both interesting and good, really glad I got to try this - would love to drink an older one for comparison!

Appears black in color and opaque until you hold it up to the light to see that it's actually dark brown around the edges of the glass with good clarity. Small dark tan head that disappears quickly. Lots of great things going on in the aroma like vanilla, cocoa, roasted/burnt malt, molasses, dark fruit, sherry, and port. These carry over to the flavor and you get some oak flavor from the barrel aging. Full bodied, rich, heavy, and vinious.     What a nice surprise to see this left over from the Deschutes event the night before! I'm trying to think of a comparable beer and Dogfish Head's World Wide Stout comes to mind. A great sipping beer for sure.

I'm thinking that The Abyss is one of a handful of RIS that launched the whiskey barrel-aged specialty and the AD/IS style.  For this and other reasons, The Abyss is on the "1001" list and deserves to be there. The reviewer tells the story of how two brewers what to emphasize molasses and the other licorice... and have made various blends since.     As for me, dark as Hell is not an attractive Look... but certainly is unique. Smell and Taste are mirrors. I get the licorice root and the sulfur of the molasses and I even tell myself that this would be a good time to start smoking again. What I don't particularly like compared to the competition is the dry finish, very bitter-sweet. I'll try this with different deserts over the next few nights. But that is the weakness from this being great.

I do have 2016 aging and will review that later on this year.     Look: Black, pours with minimal to no head.    Smell: Smells great! As for specific flavors, I do not remember and it would be unfair to state a guess.    Taste: It tastes fantastic, I want to say there was some fruit notes that were present and hint of smoke as well, possibly from the barrels.    Feel: I do remember it feeling a little thin for my liking, but that did not detract from the experience.    Overall, I highly recommend obtaining this if you can. It's a great beer and will not disappoint! I will be sure to revisit this review after I've had time to enjoy one without any distractions. As always, consume responsibly!

Very dark and attractive pour. The brown head stands tall for minutes. The nose is leading to a lot of bitter malt. Taste is pretty harsh, even with some time in the bottle. The molasses and anise are not the greatest compliment to this stout. Astringent, dirty penny and tobacco taste. Bitter chocolate comes across fairly nice. Velvety smooth.

look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 '15 Reserve bottle into a snifter. Pours a very dark brown, nearly black and settles completely opaque in the glass. Blacker than Al Sharpton's shoe polish. Topped off with about a finger and a half of bubbly, mocha-colored foam. Wonerful nose, wow. Roasted malt, sweet caramel, dark chocolate, molasses, warm whiskey, burnt leather, oak, dried figs, and dark fruit. Really complex and full - one of the best smelling beers I've encountered. Reminds me of BBB if it were more choclatey and smokey.  The taste is right on par with the aroma. Loads of charred, roasted malt, smokey, oaky whiskey, bitter dark chocolate, figs, juicy dark fruit, caramel, sticky molasses..the list goes on. This beer tastes like anything and everything you'd want in an imperial stout. Some folks are saying this is boozy, some say it's too sharp - nah. Mine says "best by 12/08/16", and right now it's tasting just right. There's a definite alcohol presence in the taste, but it isn't profound nor is it overpowering. I've tasted much worse in the likes of lesser ABV beers. This is hitting the sweet spot right now for sure.  In terms of the mouthfeel, yeah..it's a bit thin. But honestly, as tasty as this beast is, it really doesn't matter much. And that's not something I've ever said before. I'm usually a stickler on the mouthfeel, especially when it comes to big stouts. But this one, somehow..I just can't knock it too much. I'm honestly glad it's not overly syrupy and chewy. If that were the case, it'd be on the level of BORIS or something similar (which was a great beer, but just a lot to take in if you know what I mean).     Frankly, I'm glad I didn't wait to drink this. I was planning to save this for my birthday in February 2017, but an extraordinarily shitty week made me crack this on a Friday night. And so it was meant to be. I don't know how the score will round out, but this may be the most satisfying imperial stout I've laid lips to yet.

Dark, BLACK malt, with mild bourbon flavor. Overall pretty thin, and just harsh, the barrel does little to alleviate this situation. Bitter, unforgiving, not smooth at all

Nose is caramel, molasses, fig, booze, burned malt. Flavor is boozy, caramel notes, dark fruits, big roasty malts on a long finish. Slick medium mouthfeel. This is a big boy, large ABV that steps forward on the palate and an enticing nose. Two years was just the right amount of time for it. I'm alone with this bomber now, so wish me luck.

S: So many flavors hit my nostrils, vanilla, bourbon, red wine, raisins, booze.    T: Fantastic, i think it was great, tasted almost as exactly as it smelled. the wine barrels made it take a turn i was kind of surprised about, it wasnt as pleasant as i thought it could have been, but it made it unique and i still enjoyed it.     F: a bit lacking in this department i thought, was smooth but felt a tiny bit thin as compared to most of this style    O: Very good beer that i'm glad to experience, though i'm not sure i'd chase this down again, i'd gladly drink it.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. 2015 edition.    L: Pours an inky black... entirely opaque with 2 fingers of brownish head. Sticky lacing all over my glass.    S: Roast and char... dark fruits, oak and vanilla.... booze.    T/F: Sweet charred malts and dark fruits.. fig and plum in the foreground. A little tartness from the wine barrels... booze and vanilla from the bourbon barrels... notes of chocolate. Complexity abounds. This is the '15 so it's still pretty 'hot'. Very warming and awesome at cellar temperature.    O: A fantastic Imperial Stout from Deschutes, and they've really pushed the envelope as to what can be accomplished with the blending of different barrel aged beers and what comes together is greater than the sum of their parts. Delicious and glad I snagged 2 more to cellar. Can't wait to see how they age.

The scent is a cacaphony of roast, chocolate, bourbon and dark fruit. The taste follows the scent quite nicely but the dark fruit is more of a cab flare. The Mouthfeel is fuller in body with smooth carbonation. Overall it's a must try.

Very strong tobacco oaky like bitter taste came through that overpowered the taste, maybe from licorice taste as well. Very tart as well because the wine barrels, wasn't a fan of it. Had a tough time finishing this one and was expecting a lot from this beer as well

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 2014 Vintage, stored away from light in ~55 degree beer fridge since purchase Nov. '14.  L: 4.75 S: 4.25 T: 4 M: 4.25 O: 4    Look: This was great. Very dark with burnt caramel head. Can't complain here.    Smell: A lot going on here and a decent balance. Smells bright on top of the dark malts.    Taste: This is the biggest disappointment. For only being 20% barrel aged (11% bourbon, 6% oak, 11% pinot noir) oak came through very strong, almost as much as Oak Aged Yeti (from memory, didn't try side by side). Molasses is noticeable and perhaps the licorice adds to the oak affect (licorice admittedly not something I like) I took my time sipping this beer and the subtle notes were more noticeable as it warmed. Found some cherry and a tartness from the pinot. More balance would make this so much better.    Mouthfeel: Second disappointment. SImply lighter than I expected. Again, it's only 20% barrel aged, but lighter still than Ten Fidy or Founders Imperial Stout. Maybe the name Abyss causes me to expect more.    Overall: 2014 was my first Abyss and I'm not overwhelmed. All that said, I'm excited for the 2015 vintage (50% BA, 21% bourbon, 8% oak, 21% wine) and the 2015 Abyss Rye. What I tasted today will be fantastic with Rye and I will update my reviews accordingly.    Disappointed is the best way to describe it.

Finishes back with roastiness, but as it warms the barrel character becomes more pronounced and weakens the finish. Definitely a great beer but it could use more barrel character, will be seeking out both the rye whiskey and cognac versions of this, and would love to see a double barrel version. I loved this beer and think it'll be even better with age.

Does smell of an earth entangled grape ripeness, which does not turn sour by any means as for a balancing, subtle integrated oak quality. A fantastic, multilayered chocolate aroma slowly evolves from scorched malts, leading to a restrained, yet enjoyable Bourbon spiciness, adding to the chocolate richness of the nose. A flowery wood bark note completes the utmost originally and well composed aromas, which get pleasantly dominated by the wine barrel and matured hops.     Drinks with a world class mouthfeel to it, due to a huge amount of whipped cream, effectivly blending into soothing chocolate. While its carbonation is certainly on the lower end, it is still able to add a subtle, bubbly refreshment during the finish.    Tastes of chocolate dipped cherries, evolving to an even fruitier stage in which juicy, matured grapes become visible, which get wrapped up by a pungent blend of burned malts and bitter chocolate. A divine creaminess caresses the tongue while oak, licorice and burned wood bark get recognizable, tied together by a subtle wine tartness, which also produces a nice sweeter quality, enhanced by caramel and rock sugar. Cocoa nibs and matured, grassy hops provide a surprisingly aggressive hop punch during the finish, immediately soothed by the rich creaminess, while molasses, oak and milk chocolate are able to cut through.    Wow, this is certainly one of the most complex beers I've ever had, which may be due to its rich chocolate maltiness, which only gets carefully accentuated by the different barrels instead of getting dominated by them. This allows to unfold a decadent, rich creaminess, shining for its very silk mouthfeel, which finds it antagonist in dry, scorched earthen malts.

A lingering bitterness reminiscent of espresso and black licorice.

S - Aroma is dark chocolate, black cherries, and roasted malts.    T - The flavor starts with chocolate, black cherries, and vanilla. The bourbon is very subtle and adds a light sweetness. The finish has heavy roasted malts and oak.    M - Heavy bodied with low carbonation. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. Dry finish.    O - Wow, there is so much going on in this beer.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 '15 on tap. Very boozy, black licorice, dark cocoa. Definitely better with some age on it, but I think 2+ years is needed to really mellow the burn. Not even close to elite tier for me, but better than average.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 2015 Reserve.  A: Black as can be. Sustained cap of khaki foam, sticky lacing.   S: The molasses/cherry/vanilla combined to form a surprisingly sweet and candy-like aroma initially, which then gave way to the roasty wine/bourbon-influenced stout. Smells properly good.  T: Not as intense as the bottle claims, but not far off. Finish is heavy on oak and wine barrel, pretty dry but with a delightful lingering taste. More sweetness and the slightest hint of bourbon up front, followed by the cherry/vanilla/fruit in the middle, before the oak really takes over again. Pretty darned good.  F: Prickly but just enough carbonation. Can be sort of abrasive if you don't swallow soon enough. Bordering on thick, slightly creamy, the right viscosity for a stout like this.   O: Solid. Brought home from a work trip to Iowa, saw it all over the place there and only took the one bottle home. Turns out it didn't last on shelves in MI, maybe next year I'll get a couple and let one rest for a while. Definitely approve.

S: Lots of booze here, it overpowers most of the other elements, hints of cherry and roast.    T: A nice toasty malt, with cherry and chocolate on top. The booze is there but not as noticeable as it was in the nose. Hints of wood and peat. Very complex and great taste.    F: Low carbonation, creamy smooth with a very full body.    O: A little boozy but overall a fantastic beer.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Poured from bomber into a snifter    Appearance – The beer pours a super dark, nearly pitch black color with a two finger head of brown colored thick foam. The head has a fantastic level of retention, slowly fading over time to rings of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.    Smell – The aroma of the beer is huge of a roasted malt smell mixed with a big showing of coffee and caramel with other notes of vanilla and chocolate being rather strong as well. Along with the these super robust aromas, comes smells of char and smoke as well as a good showing of dark fruits of raisin and prune. A bit of a boozy bourbon aroma is there as well, overall producing a smell that is very dark and roasty with a big showing of a warmingly sweet smell.    Taste – The taste begins as the nose would suggest with a massive dark roasted malt flavor and a good showing of coffee. There is a huge rich milk chocolate sweetness upfront which is accompanied by other sweet flavors of molasses and brown sugar. As the taste advances the roasted malt waivers ever so slightly, but with the coffee, is still the overall dominant taste of the brew. With the lightening of the roastiness (which is sorta odd to write as it is still super robust in dark flavors) comes a little bit of a raisin taste as well as a decent showing of vanilla; both of which join the other sweet and chocolate flavors quite nicely. As one may expect for a 12.2 % brew, there is a bit of a bourbon boozy taste that develops later in the tongue, which creates a nice warming feel. Flavors of char and a woody hop develop at the very end, combining with the alcohol, roasty, and sweet nicely to create rich, dark, and warming taste to linger on the tongue.    Mouthfeel – The beer is thick and creamy with a very low level of carbonation level. The feel is nearly perfect for the big mix of dark, sweet and boozy flavors of the brew, coating the tongue and bathing it in all the grandiose tastes of the brew.    Overall – This is a very nicely crafted imperial stout. While slightly on the sweeter side all the other attributes of the brew match the sweeter and rich flavors very well. Even while sweet, it not necessarily so, and was still drinkable (in a very slow sipping way) unlike some other imperial stouts of similar strength. Overall I was rather impressed by this brew.

Thick looking, not much head with some oily cling. Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, molasses, a little oak, licorice as it starts to warm, a little coffee. No bourbon presence noticed, maybe a hint of cherry from the pinot barrels. Taste also leads with roasted malts, chocolate, more molasses and coffee than the nose, vanilla, raisins, oak. The bourbon barrel is kind of an undertone, very subtle, the pinot adds a little bit of a fruity character. Some bitterness hits midway through the back end. Great flavor. Smooth, fairly creamy, well carbonated, a tongue coater. Great body, although lighter than typical for an RIS.     Excellent beer, complex and well blended with lots of flavor. I found the barrel aging to be very subtle in both aroma and taste- but contributing, and I'm shocked that some reviews call it a bourbon bomb. In any event, bomb or hand grenade, it's a great beer, and one you should try if you can.

It pours with a thick tan foam that slowly dissipates to a rather fascinating residue of bubbles and cascades across the surface. The body is quite dark brown, nearly black.    The smell is quite subtle: molasses and malt. Nothing much here, honestly.    The taste, however, is eat your heart out roasty! I suppose I pick up a very slight cherry and perhaps the vanilla, and maybe the wood, but it all takes a back seat to the roast. It tastes more like an hot oatmeal stout. As it warms the roasted malt balances out nicely.    Good feel. Thick, but without coating the tongue too long and lingering.    Overall, I don't find the Abyss as complex as the label suggests. The smell is too subtle and the taste is too one-dimensional. It is good though, and I intend to finish the bottle.

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 I love stouts, so when my friend went to Oregon, I asked her to see if she could find a bottle or two of this.... and she came through!     Look - it was very dark, thick black, just like I expected, with a dark brown head. Beautiful pour.     Smell - bourbon, chocolate, malt and licorice.     Taste - malty with chocolate and licorice notes. Some vanilla, and a bit of coffee.    Feel - viscous, heavy, velvety feel.    Overall - this was a delicious beer. I love Imperial Stouts and this one did not disappoint. Very well balanced beer for 12% alcohol, and the flavor wasn't overwhelmingly alcohol. Well done Deschutes! "I'll be bock."

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5 Although the best after date was 12/8/16, I opened up the bottle 10 months early. The Abyss is blacker than black (completely opaque) nice carbonation with a significant tan head in a snifter. Extremely rich, lots of dark chocolate and cherries that come at the endnotes. It's interesting how only half is the beer is barrel aged; I feel that the oak wine barrels (21%) come through the most. Next time I will have to try to be more patient and heed Deschutes' consumption date advice.

It really lacks in mouthfeel though, and that hurts the rating.

Chocolate is the dominant note with molasses & licorice & a lovely variety of flavors & finishes off with the 12.2 which initially was well hidden.an excellent brew!
