look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 A 22oz bottle of bourbon barrel aged stout dated 12/18/18. Slick oily black appearance with a thin veneer of brown head. Mild aroma of sour mash. Flavor is all about that bourbon barrel, boozy with vanilla and oak. Stout flavors are clearly an afterthought here. Roasted barley provides the color, like a porter, but roasty and toasty flavors hardly make an appearance. Though boozy, it doesn't burn, and at 11% this could prove quite dangerous (I'd have guessed around 8.5%-9%). BBA imperial stout is BBA imperial stout... but this one doesn't impress.

First, at 39 Degrees and the this evening, at 60 degrees. As we know, Cold temps often mask the beers true flavors (That's why you HAVE to drink Bud, and Miller at 32.5 Degrees) anyway, This brew pours very dark, with a thick tan colored head that at both temps dissipated in about 5 Minutes. I found the flavor at both temps very good. but at the warmer temp, I noticed a smoother richness. The malt notes were more noticeable. the hops less pronounced and the overall sweetness was enhanced. At 11.0 ABV, this brew is a bit boozy, no matter what temp you sample it at. Not for the faint of heart. Hence the name. A excellent stout. It has a spot in the "Beer Fridge".

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Poured from a single serve into a tulip    Pours an opaque black with a thin tan head, and a somewhat thin viscosity (probably from the barrel aging) but good lacing. A good pour overall.    Aromas of coffee, vanilla, oak, graham cracker, and char. Milk stout sweetness mixed with some astringent character.    The flavor is very oakey and boozy up front--almost too boozy. However, after the initial "brace" of those notes, chocolate, root beer/aged vanilla, and char come through, along with black licorice and herbal notes.    The mouthfeel is solid but not special. A little sticky in some ways--although the carbonation helps lift it a bit.    Overall, I wanted to like this brew more. It is pretty good, but not top of the line.

From the pour, it looks like it will be a bit thin.  S: Roasted malt with more dark chocolate notes and no burnt aromas. Picking up more fruit esters than I would've expected. Pleasant aroma but not getting any boozy notes from the bourbon or anything that really screams stout.  T: Very slight burnt flavor, but mostly very smooth with lots of vanilla sweetness. Maybe a touch of chocolate. Not getting any boozy flavors from the bourbon and not much complexity overall. It's good, but there's not much depth here. It's all sweetness. Hides the 11% well.  F: Smooth but thin. Low carbonation. Does build over time to feel a bit sticky, but not too bad.  O: This is a very inoffensive BBA stout. It's a slightly thinner stout, without strong bourbon flavors or heavy burnt notes from the roasted malt. Judged on its own merits, it's a good tasting stout for anyone with a sweet tooth. However, I would expect many people who regularly drink BBA stouts to be underwhelmed.

S: First time I am having a barrel aged stout, so this aroma is new to me on a beer. Getting the bourbon barrel oak first with vanilla underneath. Notable chocolate and banana once you get past the bourbon.  T: On the first few sips the bourbon barrel is immediately noticeable. As it comes closer to room temp the chocolatey and creamy malt character really balances well with the barrel oak which you start to get towards the end. Initially I thought the barrel aging might just be kind of a novelty, but it really does add character and balances the taste well.  F: Creamy with a pleasant carbonation for this type of beer.  O: This is a well executed beer all-around. It is a balanced and exciting option when I am in the mood for something with higher abv (11%). I normally don't drink stouts, but I will definitely drink more of this in the future.

Light brown head was fairly small, but appropriate for ABV. No real retention and much better than expected lacing.     S---Milk chocolate is most noticeable. Smells a little boozy, but that's just the bourbon barrel. Some roasty vanilla and a touch of coffee are also present. Very nice aroma.    T---As in the nose, milk chocolate is dominant followed by the oak & bourbon of the barrel. Vanilla is more prominent than it smelled. There's a lot going on here. Complex and excellent.    F---Rich, thick & creamy. Mouthfilling. Perfect for the style. Minimal carbonation.    O---Wow, this is a good one. It definitely opened up a ton as it went from fridge temp to room temp.

Overall, this is an exceptional imperial Stout that was definitely worth the hefty price tag and I will certainly buy it again. I find many strong imperial stouts to be a little bit too overwhelming at times especially when drinking more than one, but Dragon's Milk, while just as strong as any other does not feel like it's too much. When combined with the fact that it goes down so smoothly and is 11%, that makes this a dangerous imperial stout!

I find stouts overly sweet/heavy but this one is right on the mark with great mouthfeel and at an 11 abv that'll kick you into the next level. Great beer! Prost!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Great BBA stout. Much smoother and less bitey than its peers. Very creamy mouthfeel with heavy notes of dark chocolate, coffee, and bourbon.

Aroma is coco, dark chocolate, bourbon and woody vanilla with hints of caramel, coconut, coffee and figs. Taste is semisweet chocolate, heavy bourbon, dark roast, toasted pumpernickel and molasses with hints of burnt caramel, toffee and dark fruits. The booze is up front and forceful. No noticeable hop presence. Aftertaste is boozy, sweet,faintly peppery but short-lived with only a hint of bitter. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, creamy, silky and thinly chewy with low carbonation.

It's like a desert. I didn't taste the ABV.

The last one I had--a bomber that was aged about three years--was amazing in that the barrel character came through very nicely, and it was smooth and roast-y as well. I would happily buy this again.

The taste is just as inviting into the dragons breathe...it has a nice vianilla/chocolate and that bourbon aged oaked barrel coming thru. It does well at making the ABV, but still lets you know it's there :)  As for the feel...it also lets you know all of the above...smooth yet a lil' snap to it !! This makes it...I think this is where the name arrived from. The milky smoothness of the dragon's breathe, and then the fire of the flames ! all in all...one of my favorite stouts, and hopefully will stay that way, even if they go macro. so maybe you should try it NOW! Enjoy & have fun doing so.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 I have the bourbon barrel aged version of the Dragon's Milk Imperial stout. This is also an adjunct free imperial stout by the way. I have only had 3 other bourbon barrel aged stouts & I did not care for any of them. I am glad that I did not give up on the Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Stout beer style because it lead me to this wonderful creation. New Holland did a good job masking the 11% abv. I heard New Holland is starting to be mass produced, oh that is bad news. I am glad that I was able to try this beer before it got mass produced. So far this is World Class Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Stout in my opinion maybe my opinion will change after I drink a few more different Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Stouts from a few different breweries. I also dig the name of this beer its clever. The bourbon gives this base beer somewhat of a vanilla thing going on with some faint cinnamon action interplaying their as well. Thanks to this beer I will continue to drink Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Stouts, but it is too bad they sold out to AB INBEV. I expect the quality of this stout to go downhill eventually. Cheers!

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Awesome and unique. The notes of milk in it along with the bourbon notes are going to give it that cold winter night kind of vibe, this is also a beer you can crack open in the middle of summer and enjoy it on a cooler night. All around a great darker beer.

This, however, is not even close to the quality I am used to. I am a general fan of Founders, and I love their Breakfast Stout, and Dirty Bastard, however... This is bottom shelf quality. It tastes like watered down, generic, Crown Royal. It's price is outrageous compared to it's quality. I'm a three strike sort of man, but with what I paid for this, compared to what I got... that's two strikes at once.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 There are a bajillion different versions of this beer, but I had the original, and after that, I'd be happy to try a bunch more. It's pretty high-alcohol, very boozy, and very good. You definitely get the rich stout flavor from the barrel aging, and the sweetness from the imperial portion really comes through. Well-made, and now I'll look for some of the other varieties too.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 appearance: during the pour, the beer is a very brownish-black, akin to coffee, but it quickly becomes almost pitch black when in a full glass. held up to the light it has dark ruby highlights. after pouring, it formed with a 2cm creamy tan head that fell into a nice cap.    smell: nice and rich and chocolatey. reminds me of a chocolate stout but more roasty. there are hints of vanilla on the nose as well, reminiscent of a creamy dark chocolate mousse with a dash of coffee.    taste: the initial taste is very sweet and chocolatey. as it slides down the mouth and throat the vanilla comes up very noticeably, but only for a moment as the aftertaste gives way to more dark chocolate that blends very well with vanilla.    feel: very smooth, thick, and creamy. full bodied but not heavy. goes down like a charm, very little burn noticeable for 11% ABV. after a period of time some warmth becomes evident in the belly but it remains there and lingers comfortably.       overall: a very tasty imperial stout that's easy to drink and has a nice alcoholic kick. personally, it's a little too sweet, as i prefer more of a russian style imperial stout, but i won't complain. recommended if you like sweet and creamy stouts with a hint of roastiness.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pours a black with some ruby in shallower parts of the glass. Aroma is very boozy with some bourbon, malt, coffee, chocolate on the nose. Taste is much of the same with a nice balanced melding of all these flavors without too much roastiness being evident. If anything the roastiness is probably a little too subdued and this is coming from one who doesn't particularly like stouts and porters due to the roast. Either way this is a pleasant sipper.

Smells of bourbon, wood, vanilla and a little chocolate. Tastes similarly, along with some mild coffee, caramel and malt. Slightly boozy but really quite well balanced and alcohol isn’t that forward. Smooth, slightly creamy and soft mild mouthfeel. Good carbonation and the flavors really mellowed as the beer warmed. Outstanding beer!

A simple yet flavorful BA stout, and a good entry point for exploring the style.

Light aroma of roasted malts, cream, some booze.Some wood, vanilla. Really nice complex aroma.  The flavor at this point is less intense than the aroma, maybe a time of development currently? Expected way more from the nose than what I got out of the flavor. Not bad at all just not up to what the nose was putting out there.  Thinner body than expected. HOT @ 11%!   Good but not great at this point.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 Look, it’s got the hype of a great beer, and to be honest it’s really good but the thing that you can’t rate of this site is if it as good as the price tag demands $15 for a 12 ounce 4pck. Emm to try yes but I promise this beer will not be a regular I have 5 beans by six point for that and it’s cheaper and better.   So that’s my opening statement, the look tells a telling story its dark but for an 11% it should be be near tar colored but it’s not it’s a special dark chocolate color   The smell is riddled with booze and aged vanilla with some lite mocha and coffee notes with a strong sweet finish that after a few hard smells becomes dominant.The taste is smooth very smooth with all that aged vanilla and chocolate iced coffee goodness but it’s too smooth no one flavor pops out and says hey I’m delicious, definitely needs a star of the show.   The feel however is amazing it’s what separates this beer from all the rest it’s literally sweet and milky and smooth and amazing.If feel is your key factor this beer wins gold every time I have my issues with it but in feel it’s god undisputed.  Overall it’s really good but not worth the price point nock it down a few bills and this goes from a low 4 to a mid 4 for sure

It certainly fills a niche. Plus, the idea of milking a dragon and it coming out as a frothy BA Stout is surprisingly charming. Unfortunately it just isn't on par with its less common competitors.     L: Nice bottle, entertaining theme. Pours with just a half centimeter of mocha foam that dissipates quickly. Ends up looking just like a sweet cold-brewed black coffee. Not as black as most BA stouts; the body is more of a dark brown.    S: Not bad. Vanilla, fudge, coffee, coconut, caramel, raisins, a hint of orange and a milk chocolate finish. However, there's not much grainy/bready character going on, and what is there smells a bit stale.    T: Holds its own for a couple seconds, but then it falls apart. Fudge, vanilla, and coffee host a party and some sweet raisins and salty pretzels show up. With coconut and licorice planning to stop by later, you're anticipating a good sip. But then a stale cardboard note shows up and makes the whole thing weird until everyone else clears out.    F: Thin. Flat. Syrupy. Stale aftertaste... It could be worse, but that's not the goal.    O: A great choice if you want to get intoxicated quickly and you really want to be drinking beer. However, it's a poor substitute for the rich, roasty elixirs that most other breweries release a small batch of once a year or less. However, if you eat fruits out of season, you can't expect them to taste the same either. Maybe it's a necessary compromise.

look: 3.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 L -- Pours a surprisingly light shade of black for the style, bordering on deep brown. Small whitish-tan head produced with aerated pour. Minimal retention or lacing   S -- Oak, dark chocolate, bourbon, hazelnut, coffee, touch of lactose   T -- Oaky bourbon, dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, roasty barley malts, light char, and vanilla   F -- Soft, smooth, and lightly velvety. Restrained bitterness throughout. Body feels a little limp/watery, at least given the style and the ABV but nothing too offensive.   O -- Glad to finally be trying this staple of the substyle. Wish it were just a hair more robust, although I can see how it has become a classic. If I were drinking this in 2001, I'm sure I would be completely floored.     83/100

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 L - Pitch, opaque black with a medium tan head that sticks around and leaves lacing behind.   S - Rich notes of chocolate and vanilla along with a malty sweetness.   T - Rich notes of chocolate and vanilla up front intermixed well with the sweet maltiness. On the back end there's a slight amount of smokiness from the bourbon barrels. Slight warmth from the alcohol at the end - but not off putting.   F - Medium to full bodied with a light to medium amount of carbonation. Smooth   O - A really nice if somewhat toned down bourbon barrel aged stout. I say toned down because some bourbon barrel aged stouts can smack you in the face with the notes of bourbon but this one is more mellow - but that's not a bad thing as it provides a smooth, easy to drink, well rounded flavor.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Bottled 1/11/18    A really beautiful looking beer. Black body, no light coming through, Just a little ruby tint all the way at the edge. smooth and fizzy brown cocoa head, okay lacing.    The smell is predominately fig, dark fruit (dried plum), raisin, and roasty malts. Hint of vanilla.    Taste is plum, dark fruity fig, roasted malt bitterness and some vanilla extract paired with some evident heat midway through and more heat on the back. Not much oakey character present here. Could almost pass as an imperial stout w/ no barrel aging, let alone bourbon barrel aging.    Mouthfeel is fairly thin, almost watery. Low to medium carbonation, doesn’t stick to the tongue much.    This is enjoyable as a plum-y/fig-y imperial stout with some heavy roasted malt character but doesn’t really fit the profile of bourbon barrel aged, as labelled. Really pretty brew but misses the mark in scent, flavor, and mouthfeel. Maybe it could use some aging.

The oak and bourbon are SO present and SO wonderful! That's what I wanted. But initially I found a rich roasty porter vanilla aroma. It's boozy with a heavy bourbon presence.   T: Very flavorful. Strong, aged bourbon and dark rich beer. Vanilla. Alcohol. First couple of swigs can't be beat! Heavy bourbon presence.   F: Thick. Creamy. Very bold.   O: Wow. A very enjoyable and very powerful double imperial bourbon stout. The bourbon is very very present but that’s what I was hoping for. Expensive but worth it. Thanks to Chelsea Citgo.

Well hidden booze, at first, but the mighty burn marches on.  Imperial indeed, hold onto the floor!   If not for the Bourbon Barrel-Aged I imagine this is nigh North Coast's Brother Thelonious, minus the Peanut flavor, thank the gods!

look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 2 | overall: 4.25 I will fully admit up front that I am not a Bourbon fan (though I do really enjoy the Bourbon sauce at one of my favorite local restaurants). I did approach the Dragon's Milk knowing it would have a Bourbon aspect. And, yes it does.    On first approach, it does have a strong bourbon aroma. The first few sips are also dominated by a bourbon-forward taste. After this, however, the Imperial Stout makes its presence known.     It is very dark, and only had a moderate head, though the pour into the tulip glass was not particularly hard. No lacing once the head dissipated.     Deep, roasted flavors, with cherry notes.     I am about 1/3 through the glass, and the alcohol burn is still reminding me that this is 11% ABV.    Based on the previous reviews, I was looking forward to a deep, dark, complex flavor profile, and was not disappointed. (I was willing to deal with the Bourbon to try this beer, as I am always up for a substantial dark beer.)    I don't know that I would ever buy this beer for myself in the future, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down if offered to me, and would happily accept and enjoy it.

Lacing remains on the edges of the glass. What an enticing smell! Roasted barley, vanilla, caramel, faint chocolate; can't wait to taste it. Fantastic! The oakiness of the barrels comes through well. Vanilla and roasted goodness. At 11% the alcohol warmth is apparent. Dry oak finish. (Too much oak?) I think more bourbon and less oak is needed.

I do not recall drinking this beer, but that does not mean anything. Poured into my tulip glass at 44 degrees. The light tan head is creamy and airy. The retention on the head is par. The head left no lacing as it dissipated. The color of the beer is dark brown, nearly black and opaque. The appearance of this beer is above average.     The barrel age on the beer is not as strong on the nose. The aromas in the beer are vanilla, burnt sugar, oak, molasses, earth, roasted dark malts, caramel, toffee, bready, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits, and solvent-like.    The flavors in the beer are burnt sugar, oak, molasses, roasted dark malt, toffee, coffee, chocolate, toffee, bready, dark fruits, and phenolic taste.     The mouthfeel of the beer is harsh and slightly warm. The body of the beer is medium-plus, medium carbonation, and a medium-plus finish.     The beer is lacking many qualities from making this a great beer. The body of the beer is too thin for an imperial stout. The balance of the beer is out of kilter. The flavor is not harmonious. Lastly, the barrel age of the beer is a joke. I do get the barrel flavors but quite weak.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 12oz. bottle into tulip pint    Look: opaque black with a coffee-colored head.     Smell: dark chocolate, molasses, bourbon, some dark fruit (plums, dried cherries)    Taste: roasted dark chocolate notes, brown sugar/molasses-type sweetness, a bit of vanilla, and a bourbon note in the finish. Serious alcohol warmth on the back end. As a tasting note: you want to let this come to cellar temperature before passing judgment. The roasted, bourbon, and vanilla notes hide behind the sweetness until it warms up a bit. Drinking this at fridge temperature will make it overly sweet and syrupy.    Feel: It's a big, chewy beer. There's enough carbonation to form a head with a rough pour, but not enough to disrupt a very rich mouthfeel. Slight drying note from the oak barrels, as well.    Overall: a good representation of the style.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Pours very dark with quickly receding foamy head. Nose is mostly yeasty, some chocolate notes in the background. Taste is big chocolate, caramel, a little overcarbonated for my taste, some vanilla in the middle, tannins on the finish combined with the bittering hops leave my tongue a little numb after a while. Fairly full bodied and slick. Overall a nice year round offering that will satisfy any yearning for a BA stout. Glad to see it on the shelves.    1/9/18  12 oz bottle dated 4/18/17  3.75 rating

The smell itself is a treat to enjoy with this one. Lending notes of sweetness and some roasty bitter malts.   Then the taste is that sweetness again. Almost a marshmallow sweetness with some notes of slightly bitter chocolate and vanilla. And then come the roasty flavors that mix with the balanced barrel. Bourbon is just enough to let you know it's there and warm the drink up.   Once you get through the creamy head the feeling is thick and like eating marshmallows.   Overall, I always enjoy drinking a Dragon's Milk and love how available it is for being such a good bourbon barrel aged Stout. Thanks New Holland!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 Look: Deep, opaque, chocolate brown with a minor white head.    Smell: Malt, chocolate, booze-soaked cherries, and basically no hint of hops.    Taste: Dark chocolate and bitter coffee dominate, with that cherry flavor remaining from the nose and a bit of bourbon (probably from the oak cask aging). There's almost no hop bitterness, resembling the bitterness of black coffee more.    Mouthfeel: Full and creamy.    Overall: An excellent beer for any time, and a real way of showing just what a beer is capable of.

Tastes of figs and vanilla initially, followed by a warm bit of booze, then coffee. Drinks as well or better than the average 11% ABV Stout. I'm glad this is carried locally now, I will buy it again.

A good inch of off-white froth welled up to the brim, and receded slowly to a partial skim-coat on the surface. Lacework aplenty. Aromatics are nice blend of caramel, roasted malts, bourbon, and oak. Vanilla follows through with some warming alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium and creamy. Pretty smooth and somewhat lush. The pallet has a great balance of chocolate, caramel, nougat, bourbon, oaky tannins, and vanilla. Nicely melded with not one of the layers overbearing the others. Finishes with a hint of residuals and warming bourbon and vanilla.    Not the biggest, baddest dark beer on the planet, but impeccably balanced and highly drinkable.

Ever since I saw this brew on one of the FB craft beer pages I frequent, I have wanted to try it. I first came across it in Nebraska visiting my son in at Offut AFB, but of course he was under age and I could not purchase anything on base without his help. Fast forward 6-months and this appears at my local chain-grocery store - what a score. Anyway, today I enjoyed a deep, dark brew with tan foam that has some very good staying power with light lacing added in. The smell was boozy, mostly, but not overpowering with a mouthfeel that though carbonated did not distract from the almost creamy texture of the beer. I noted chocolate flavors, a touch of cinnamon, but the brew was mostly bourbon - so it lacked the complexity I was expecting. Nonetheless, this is a good beer, one I will be enjoying again before the holidays are over...

A subtle sweetness, like a combination of bourbon and molasses.    Deceivingly sweet! A lingering roasted coffee, but I’m getting a lot of prevalent dark chocolate and vanilla. An incredibly drinkable 11% stout.    A nice medium bodied stout, drinks very smooth, and leaves and even stout stickiness in the finish.    I think this lived up to the hype I’ve heard. So incredibly drinkable, and it’s formidable presence of chocolate and vanilla I can imagine leave it being a fan favorite.

The head was quite thin, mainly being a some beige rim foam. Lacing is on the light side as well. The aroma has a notable bourbon aspect to it, along with some dark choco and booziness. It is pretty smooth going down, and the body is a touch more than medium.    Flavor has more choco and bourbon, along with some cocoa and mocha, with a bit of vanilla mixed in. Also has some intimations of dark fruit lurking within, like chocolate-covered cherries. Hopping is almost non-existant, with the choco and bourbon lingering in the finish.

Being a chef I paired this with a grilled tender loin, wilted pepadew spinach. And roasted cauliflower and potato purée. The dragons milk made a great pan sauce for the tenderloin.

Dark, roasty tones of a stout; coffee and chocolate from the malted barley; bourbon barrels brings sweet booziness of bourbon; the oak brings vanilla (and sometimes coconut).”  I found that this beer changed dramatically as it warmed with the chocolate overtones blending with the original bourbon sweetness. This is a year-round offering. Simply, an excellent beer. Personally, I would prefer Fall & Winter months. Excellent.   
look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25 From the 09/13/17 bottle. Sampled on November 18, 2017.    Dark chocolate black pour with a modest tan head on top.     The aroma has a chocolate sensation, dark toasted bread, and Bourbon. It smells roasted with a bit of cherry. The hop profile is about nil.     The body is full.    The taste has the same chocolate character but the booziness from the Bourbon is quite apparent. I also pick up a cherry character in the taste. Sweet and boozy. This one is a definite sipper.   
look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 I'm not a huge beer guy, but Dragon's Milk is a somewhat approachable drink for a newbie. It has a thick mouth feeling with a distinct, robust flavor that one would find in a strong med-dark to dark roast coffee and a subtle hint of vanilla on it's way down. Complimenting this is the sharp spice of being aged in a bourbon barrel upon hitting the tongue, and an oaky undertone to round everything out as it settles on the palete. The taste isn't overbearing in hoppiness, spiciness or sweetness and the smell certainly reminds the drinker of autumn, and can only be described as "earthy" with a mile bite. The color of this American stout is that of a deep, dark one; reminiscent of dark chocolate or syrup.

It is smooth, with a hint of oak, and bourbon, nice alcohol level boarding on almost too much but almost. Those that do not absolutely love stouts without question will not like this brew. If you are a HOP fan stay clear!!!!!!. For me the darker the brew, the stronger the brew makes me happy and this one hits the NAIL on the head.

Its just a tad bourbon like, kind of flat but still carbed. Taste is the only good thing I can detect, with a chocolate and toffee like base and a little on the sweet side. Try it once but I cant reccommend it for people that have had the likes of abyss.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I have been hearing about Dragon’s Milk for a while and finally got a chance to try it. Expectations were high.  Pours a dark brown/mahogany with a hint of ruby. A fingernail length cream head shows good retention, while the lace clings to the glass like sea foam.  Everything about the nose alerts you that this will be a big, robust and strong beer in every way. The oak and bourbon foretell the strong presence of alcohol. The coffee, burnt caramel, and roasted malt show off the bold qualities of an imperial stout. In addition, hints of vanilla, cherries and cream add to the complexity. Well into the drink there is a bit of smoked malt towards the end.   Going into the mouth, the tongue is immediately hit with decadent sweetness and booze. Initially, there is a clean alcohol finish that gradually burns going down the throat. Full bodied and robust. A chewy dark malt body, tinged with bourbon and alcohol spice, dark caramel, cherries, oak, vanilla and rich dark fruity marmalade. A moderate bitterness from roasted malt, espresso beans and hops coats the mouth and balances some of the nearly cloying sweetness and alcohol burn. of hops spice.   Interestingly enough, the intensity of flavor mellows out somewhat midway, actually improving drinkability. The body evolves into a lighter, silkier and creamier mouthfeel. The alcohol burn begins to settle and the sweetness gives way more to the hops, roasted malts, as well as a light cocoa flavor that is smoother.  A bold, complex, dynamic and highly alcoholic stout. Worth the try.

It takes a heavy pour to get any head at all and what head there is doesn't last. The bourbon barrel aging adds a new dimension to the flavor. I've had many bourbon barrel aged beers that taste like bourbon and nothing else. This is not one of those, and to be honest I doubt I would have even tried this beer had I seen that printed at the bottom of the label. Mouth feel is milky and very heavy. You pretty much expect this from such a dark beer. I may be imagining things but I'm pretty sure this beer is so dark it sucked the light out of the room I poured it in as well as the adjacent rooms. I poured my first in a frosty pint glass, but the rest I poured in in coffee cup, because it seemed appropriate at the time. Did I mention this stuff is strong? I ask this question because it is strong beer. Delicious and highly recommended.

Mild lacing around the edges.  S: Sweet, thick bourbon, smooth dark chocolate, leather, sweet tobacco, vanilla, and hints of molasses, anise, and coffee. Wow!  T: Smooth dark chocolate hits first, quickly followed by the thick sweet bourbon note. Leather, mildly charred wood, sweet tobacco, and vanilla. Very, very nice.  M: Medium heavy body. Velvety and coating feel. Darkly sweet with mild (surprised it's not more at 11%) alcohol burn. Nice lingering and maturing on the palate.  D: A super solid brew...delivers on all fronts and perfectly balanced. Wonderfully crafted!    10/16/18:  Cellared one from the same batch as above (bottled 02/15/17)...time to crack it open!  A: Pours a dark brown with 1 inch dark tan head with excellent retention. (4.25)   S: Smooth dark chocolate, sweet bourbon, vanilla, molasses, soft leather, oak, and hints of tobacco and coffee. Still a lovely aroma. (4.5)  T: Bittersweet chocolate, medium roast coffee, sweet bourbon, vanilla cream, molasses, leather, oak, sweet tobacco, and still some of that nice charred wood. (4.5...maybe even 4.75)  M: Medium body. Darkly sweet with some bitter coffee and char around the edges to give it a bit of a bite. Oily, viscous, and coating. Lingers and matures very nicely on the palate. (4.5...again maybe 4.75)  D: Super drinkable even at the hefty ABV (which is masterfully hidden). This has cellared extremely well over the past year...if anything it's even a bit better. (4.5...or 4.75)   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 I don't know why this beer gets so many unfavorable reviews. It's delicious and way better than other bourbon beers I've had. Maybe my palate isn't well developed enough yet, who knows. I think it's great.   Looks deep dark brown.  Smells of bourbon and vanilla.   Tastes full on like bourbon barrels and vanilla. I'm also getting some raisin and chocolatey tastes. Sweet going down. Alcohol stays in the back of the throat for a while.  Mouthfeel is medium juicy and thirst quenching.   Overall I love this beer and at 11% I'll drink it all night long!!!   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Look: poured light brown, dark brown in the glass, no head, some ruby around the outside when held to light.    smell: raisin, sweet    Taste: Wow! Raisin, plum, oak, light chocolate, hints of vanilla and roastyness on the finish. There's no outright bourbon taste or smell that I can detect. Its contributing silently in the background.    Feel: medium, not what a seasoned beer geek would expect in a stout ...but then again Guinness is the most recognized "Stout" in the World and its watery compared to this so there's that. Slight soapiness, carbonation brings a light creaminess.     Overall: This was the first craft beer I both enjoyed and loved so I am biased but not blind. I notice huge inconsistencies with this beer, at times its an A+ and other times its a B- but this bottle hits the mark with bold flavors and complexity! (Which is why I chose to review it) Seems more of a Barley wine/Stout Hybrid than a Stout alone but whatever it is it's definitely Imperial. This particular bottle is so good it reminds me of a light version of Bourbon County Barley Wine.

The beer pours very dark brown with a small tan head that fades into a ring hugging the glass. There are a few bubbles on top of the beer but no lacing of any account. The aroma is more vanilla and wood than bourbon. The taste is smooth sweet malt first transitioning to oak, bourbon and a bit of prickly heat as it finishes. There is some vanilla and marshmallow somewhere in the middle as well. You get just a small amount of alcohol heat but it isn't harsh or distracting. Mouthfeel is soft, medium bodied, perhaps a bit too carbonated, and balanced in the finish. Overall, very good. This is a great stout at 5 months in the bottle and cellar temperature. It has a nice array of flavors without bourbon dominating.

However, I finally got around to trying it today and I am left completely flat. Especially for all the carbonation in this beer, I love a good stout, especially a good bourbon barrel aged one. This is the worst one I have ever had, hands down!!!! Looks good, smells ok, hits your tongue and inflames it with bubbly gook. Yuck! It is truly undrinkable, don't waste your time with this one, especially with all the great ones that are out there. Thy Left Coast Ale Espetitos, its fabulous and only $6 or Saint Archer\s Tusk and Grain 002, Magnificent!

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Another solid imperial stout. Nearly black in appearance with minimal head and lacing. Smells of cocoa and leather. Taste is similar to the smell. Pleasant, earthy, and with just a hint of bourbon flavor. There is a creaminess to the mouthfeel, though it feels a bit watery at the same time. Odd.    An admirable brew. Not my favorite in the style, but still tasty and enjoyable and something I will buy again.

This one pours black, but not quite as black as the big bad black as night ones. Creamy tan head, 2/3". Good density. You are my density Lorraine. Aroma is mild on the barrel. Mostly cancels out roastiness, mild chocolate after that.    Taste is nice and middle of the road. Very little barrel character, but at the same time, the chocolate malt and vanilla notes are nice. Mouth feel is good by virtue of making an 11% beer very drinkable, bitterness and roastiness are not excessive. I mean, its pretty accessible, you can get growlers of it in Nevada now. Would bang again, and its at a good price.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. It looks dark caramel in the glass. It smells like bananas, clove and honey. The taste is a little overly sweet, like toffee. The sweetness clings on a little too tightly. Overall, a beer to experience every so often, but not a regular treat.

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 1.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 1 I had to pour this one out. It tasted like wine with sugar and chocolate added to it to cover any unpleasant tastes. Zero balance to this stuff, just put as much sweet chocolaty type ingredients as possible, and it is just so rich and disgusting after a few sips, I poured it out and won't touch it again. It looks cool though, it is just impossible to drink.

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Poured from a 22oz bottle into a 12oz goblet.     Look - Solid appearance, while not neither amazing or particularly unique. Completely opaque black/dark brown, with a beautiful khaki head that fades quickly and holds a medium-sized ring all the way through the glass.     Smell - Really a highlight for this beer. It has bitter and milk chocolate, vanilla, coconut, salted caramel (a particularly singular note), and light bourbon.     Taste - Follows the nose when cold, but shows increased bourbon and milk chocolate as it warms. Slightly more vanilla and nuts as well with warming. Really delicious.     Feel - The feel on this stout is very good, and falls short of excellent just slightly. While it has just enough sticky viscosity to be satisfying and landing close to my preferences, it has a bit too more carbonation than I look for in beers of this kind. At times, the carbonation is a nice addition, particularly in adding detail to the vanilla and coconut and the creaminess of the milk chocolate flavors, but a barrel-aged stout with more bitterness and earthy roasted flavors and a stickier and heavier mouthfeel would advance some of the flavors this beer is working with.     All in all, a really good barrel-aged stout that's available year-round, modestly priced for its style and with more quality than you might expect from that. Well worth a try.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 The appearance was a black colored body that yields a one finger white head that concaves into the body after about a half minute with no carbonation seen rising. Some thick foamy lacing graces the sides of the pint glass. The smell had the bourbon up front with some chocolate in the background. The taste was balanced around the bourbon and chocolate, some slight roastiness comes in as the beer warms. On the palate, it was creamy and close to a medium maybe heavy sort of feel. There is a dry and bitter aftertaste. This isn’t exactly a drinkable beer, probably because of the high ABV. Overall, good for what it is, but there's so many Imperial Stouts out there these days.   
look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 1 | feel: 2 | overall: 2.75 Rarely do I disagree with the BA score of a beer but I am going to have too in this instance. This beer certainly looks and smells good. Oily black when held to the light and the hints of bourbon mingle well with the coffee and vanilla scents that linger in the background. The taste is where this brew falls flat. It is messy. Where as the nose was subtle and inviting the taste is an unpleasant jumble. The 11% ABV just does not seem to mesh well with the other flavors present. Some mouthfuls end up tasting like straight alcohol, others like straight coffee while occasionally I get just a hint of the balance I think was being sought.    A trusty friend has assured me that I am perfectly crazy for not enjoying this one and maybe my palette does need some adjusting after a steady dose of IPA's thus far this year so digest this review with that in mind. Cheers.

Fair lacing. No light gets through even on the edges of the glass.    Smell is chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla, caramel, and oak. Just a hint of bourbon but very malty overall.    Taste is roasted malts, chocolate, raisins, mild coffee, and bourbony booze. 11% ABV and you can taste it.    Mouthfeel is heavy, sticky, and warming. Low carbonation.    Overall, a good bourbon barrel aged stout. A bit boozy.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Look: Very dark black color. No light getting through. Low carbonation, but typical for a barrel aged brew w/ whiskey infused. Not quite a 1 finger head from a 12oz. bottle. Some lacing goes on - it didn't go flat.  Smell: Sweet chocolate and caramel. Bourbon comes through loud and clear. Some fruitiness and slight nuttiness.  Taste: A shot of whiskey up front. Nice kick, but not as strong as some barrel aged brews. Charred oak, chocolate, coffee, and roasted nuts come through. Quite sweet on the front half, then it dries out slightly towards the end. As the whiskey and chocolate/coffee flavors head out, you can start to make out some hop flavor and you are left with a slightly smokey aftertaste.  Feel: Full bodied, but less than a regular milk stout. The whiskey thins the think brew out a bit. On the flatter side, but enough to keep ti interesting. Expected it not to be very bubbly.  Overall: Very good aged stout. This one is at 11% ABV. I could feel the alcohol burn, but it didn't seem like an 11% brew. I was feeling it by the time I finished it. I bought this as a single, but would definitely by a 4 pack of this one.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 I think the overall rating for this BA Stout is dead on. It's "Very Good" and I mean that as a compliment. Not world class but a great BA Stout that is easily attained. A good indicator of what a quality BA Stout should taste like although I don't personally think you get the rich mouthfeel or complexities in taste, in comparison to some world class smaller batch brews. But I do like that you get a hint of the barrel as well as the bourbon on the nose. And the overall is solid! As a fan of BA stouts (which everyone is doing now) I would gladly keep one of these in my "cellar" (beer fridge).

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 It pours jet black and with a tan/beige head of surprisingly good retention but little lacing. Aroma is absolutely lovely with notes of vanilla, dried fruit, bourbon and a ton of chocolate. The taste is very well balanced and reflects in many ways the nose. Full bodied and with barely noticeable carbonation on the tongue. A very enjoyable bourbon-barrel-aged stout.

Roasted malt aroma, rather nondescript.  Mostly chocolate, slight coffee, tiny bit of vanilla.  An OK beer. I've been drinking a number of stouts lately, and this one didn't quite measure up to some of the others.

Smells like wood char and roasted malts with some coffee in the back there somewhere.    Taste is of stone fruits, vanilla and roasted malts. There is a definite alcohol presence on the taste. As the beer warms the vanilla sweetness was becoming more prevalent.    Has a medium mouth with an easy finish to it. The mouth does get a bit sticky as the beer warms.    This is an awesome stout that was really opening up as it warmed with nice changing complexity to it. The vanilla sweetness really was a great compliment to the darkness of this very big beer. At 11% you are going to feel that alcohol as well. I am really glad I bought this one and the wife strongly agrees that this is a solid hit.

If you haven't had a barrel aged stout and want to try one, this is a good way to go.

Look: Very dark brown like coffee with a thin vanilla colored head. Nice lace around the edge of the glass.    Aroma: Bourbon notes come first followed by dark chocolate, subtle roastiness, and vanilla.    Taste: Excellent balance of roast, vanilla, dark fruits, espresso and dark chocolate. There is a bite of carbonation but dies down as the beer warms. Not as much of a burn from the booze as I was expecting considering it's 11% although it does have a warming feel as it slides down into your belly.    Mouth feel: Thin and a little creamy, doesn't lace the mouth like most stouts do.    Overall: I think this is an excellent beer it's definitely up there in my list of favorite stouts. Would definitely recommend trying if you've never had it before, it'll be well worth your time.    -J

This one is milder than many, but it strikes me that's a good thing, not a defect. Imagine an iced latte, milky and full of coffee (light roast, not Charbucks), with a dash of bourbon. That's what you get here. Well, not literally, but that's what Dragon's Milk reminds me of. It's got lots of vanilla, and it's sweeter than many stouts, but not excessively so.    It seems odd to call any BBA stout understated, but that's what this feels like. It's a delicious beer, and you can't beat the price.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Bottle dated 8-31-16. DFH Tulip.    A: black, opaque, a little carb visible at the edges; when held to the light, some brownish tiny at the rim. 1 finger frothy lightntam head quickly fades to a ring of bubbles at the glass edge. Leaves very nice lacing.    S: smells like a RIS, dark roasted malt, but not at all a roast bomb here; sweeter and more restrained, with loads of vanilla. Perhaps a touch of alcohol or bourbon on the nose; but if I didn't know what kind of barrel this was aged in, I'd just say sweet and vanilla beans.    T: Bourbon does make its presence known immediately on the palate. Sweet and full of those pleasant aldehyde/acetone notes that are in bourbon. Surprisingly light for an RIS, as compared to the last one I had. More alcohol, vanilla, and bourbon flavor around mid palate; as it goes on the malt character recedes and this becomes more of a bourbon show with less dark roastiness. Even the finish is bourbon and oak.     M: lighter side of full bodied, with low carbonation, and surprisingly un-slick for the style. Definitely would consider it creamy.    O: I've never had a barrel aged beer before, and this is pretty much what I expected. This gets a lot from the barrel. Although I love whisky, and I love beer, i don't think I love them together. particularly with an RIS. I like The Alltech bourbon barrel ale a lot; this, not as much. It's also pretty pricy.

While is doesn't compare to the "once a year" BA stouts I think it's great that I can get this 7/365 at any decent beer store.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with little light transmission in the glass and a half finger light brown head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, mild bourbon, milk chocolate and a hint of cherry. Flavor is semi-sweet dark toasted malt, milk and dark chocolate, vanilla, light bourbon, a hint of cherry and dark stone fruit. Finishes with milk chocolate, vanilla, mild oak and hints of fruit. Medium bodied with a pleasant light creaminess. A remarkably mellow stout for its ABV. Initially seem understated, but reveals quite a bit of flavor complexity that is very well integrated and balanced. The bourbon and barrel flavors are all present, but meld with the malt quit nicely. There is a mild lactose component that makes this almost taste like an imperial milk stout. Sweeter than other big imperial stouts, but finishes semi-dry. My first taste seemed too tame to be a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout and there is little char to the malt. But each taste was so pleasant and well balanced that this was a pleasure to drink. Nicely done. Glad to have the chance to try this classic stout.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Pours on the lighter side but pitch black in the glass w/a medium khaki head. Definitely get some nice medium woodiness from the barrel aging with just a tiny bit of bourbon soaked cherries as well. Woodiness is apartment in the mouth with a good amount vanilla sweetness. Not much cherry. Some chocolate is present but it's sweet like Hershey's chocolate. Not motor oil thick by any means but there is definitely some creaminess in there. Wouldn't be surprised if they brewed this with lactose(they do call it dragon's milk afterall). Overall I think they did a good job not over doing it with the barrel aging. The barrel is there but it supports as opposed to overpowers the base beer. A well executed stout that's just a little sweet for my taste. 90 points.

Looks jet black with 1 finger of medium tan head , some carbonation but not too heavy , very little lacing.    Smell is mostly bourbon with some fresh wood mixed in , not picking up much else.    Taste , not sure what I was expecting really but just didn't think it would have so much bourbon flavor.. It's like someone poured half a glass of bourbon and topped it off with a weak watery stout.    Feel is very watery for a stout .    Overall I'm saying if you are wanting watered down bourbon you will enjoy this but if you're looking for a good stout keep in looking.. Worth trying but would not but again.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Motor oil color, frothy coffee-like head, heavy body, sweet, lots of vanila notes.

I picked up a single 12-ounce for $4, glad I did, but not sure I'd spend the money a four pack.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Deep, dark brown in color. Tan head with streak lacing. Aroma is cocoa, vanilla, oak, & toasted malt.

Initial impression is bourbon, molasses, roaste malts, vanilla, and caramel. Really smooth mouthfeel. Carbonation is light but more than adequate. Alcohol warming is noticeable but not objectionable - no rough edges despite the 11% ABV. If I had more than one I might be tempted to cellar it, but OTOH it's so damned smooth and tasty I'm not sure I would. Absolutley delicious!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Got this on a whim because my minister had recommended the base Dragon's Milk. Thought if he liked that, I should step it up and get the bourbon one. I'm glad I did...    "Bomber" bottle in a tulip glass. Shared with a friend. There's no better way than to have a beer like this.    L: totally dark brown, opaque. Initial thick head that quickly dissipated into a thin bead around the edge and lacing floating on the top. Thick "legs" on the glass as I swirled.  S: boozy at first, then sweet. Like a dessert. Dark sweet cherries. Like if I stuck my face in a jar of molasses and then some cherry syrup or dark cherry jam. But not so sweet I stepped away. Well, at first. But only because I didn't know what to expect. Then I went for more smells. Bourbon comes on pretty quick, and vanilla from the barrel aging.  T: bourbon, at first. Then some stout flavors. Could be more roasty, but it's definitely a stout. It's sweet, but not cloying. There's a lot of complexity that comes out as the beer ages and mixes with air and as my palate adjusts to it. This was a tasty beer. It's a sipping beer.  F: Not as thick as I thought it would be. But soft, smooth. Maybe a tad over carbonated, but I'm splitting hairs only because I'm thinking about it so much. There's so much flavor that if it were any thicker the flavors would linger more and this could become overwhelming. So I'm torn between wanting it thicker because that's how it looked or is it ok because there's a lot of complexity. Again, I'm nitpicking.  O: I might get two more. One for drinking soon and another for setting aside a while

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Bottled 10/14. About month old.     Appearance is gorgeous. Ink black with a khaki tan head that sticks around for a few minutes in the tulip.     Being that this one is so fresh, I expected more barrel presence. The smell and taste are very tame on the bourbon. But make no mistake about it, this is a very well made beer.     Dark fruits, plumb & dark cherries. Powdered milk chocolate and sweet cream more so than vanilla. Oakiness throughout. Not much on the bourbon but it's there.     Everything works really well in this beer cohesively while staying balanced and tame when it comes to the barrel. Mouthfeel is soft & creamy. Goes down very soft & easy for the ABV. I wouldn't call this thin, but wouldn't call it chewy or viscous either. Very enjoyable.    I can see how some might view this as mediocre in comparison to the Bourbon County's & Parabola heavy hitters of this style. However; not being so in your face with barrel as so many of this stlye seem to be, was a unexpected and appreciated nice change of pace for this BA.

This was my fift tonight and it poured about 3/8" worth of head that faded rather quickly, but left a good lacing throughout. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into tulip glass. It's dark and opaque, a black beer. I'd already drank three if these on prior nights and it grew on me as this style usually does. A smoky aroma that is really satisfying. Mothefeel is solid, almost creamy, maybe even too creamy ... Wow it is strong which threw me off at first. Honestly the first bottle i didn't care for, but this fourth one is nice. Maybe still a little too strong though. Really it has a touch of sourness in addition to a prominent taste of bourbon/alcohol. It's complex. Just try it for yourself a few times and maybe it'll grow on you too ... I'd grab it again if given the opportunity.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Pours black as everyone says, with a minimal head. Aroma is surprising subtle considering this is an 11% Russian. Booze, dark fruit, and malts and a bit of anise.    Taste is pretty bourbon forward, then roasty malts come in nicely right after. Booze-soaked oak sweetness is on the border of sickly, possibly due to the high alcohol, still the heat is well hidden but at 11% you're not fooling anyone. Chocolate, a hint of wood, vanilla, and a thin soda feel is my lasting impression.     I feel like they didn't get a handle on this one. I'm not sure the bourbon barrels did this stout any favors, tastes like the cheap stuff was in those barrels. The base seems closer to a porter than a stout. A little thin, a little too sweet. Doesn't have the deep body many BBA stouts have.

Not too much of a roast malt, no coffee or chocolate. The thin Stout backbone gives this a bit of an Irish Car Bomb feel, like booze poured into a Guinness. 3.5    M - Thinner than most Barrel-aged stouts, leaves a little stickiness. Not super clean, but no unpleasant bitterness after. 3    O - I feel like this beer used to be the standard for Barrel-aged beer, but the bar has been raised significantly since it's start. This is the Irish Car Bomb beer. The style has been inflated. This is now a bottom tier BA stout. However; this classic doesn't have anything inherently wrong with it. It's thin, simple, but a classic. 3.25

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Appearance: Very dark brown with a fairly generous-sized dark beige head that gradually faded. A good looking Imperial Stout    Smell:Bourbon, mild oak, mild brown sugar, and mild roasted malt/coffee aromas.     Taste: The taste profile features Bourbon notes, tannic oak notes, and mild brown sugar. The taste profile is balanced with the bal-aging notes apparent but not as forward as some beers, e.g. Bourbon County Stout. Fairly restrained alcohol presence.     Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation. compared to some of the more viscous Imperial Stouts it's on the light side body-wise.    Overall: A good Imperial Stout that's readily available at a good price point. Sounds like a winner to me.  Edit: After letting it warm a bit I bumped the taste score up one notch.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 This edition of Dragons Milk has the dark black roasty coloring that comes standard with each edition of Dragonsmilk. Great lacing with a thick head upfront (poured into a snifter), although head retention is not enduring.    There is a very boozy smell upfront with some roastiness. Mostly booze though.    The taste is definitely more alcohol heavy upfront, which recedes into a more malty, nutty stout taste. Once again, more boozy than not, but that might be a plus for bourbon beer enthusiasts. The oakiness comes through initially, but its tenure is short lived. Good for the style overall, but nothing mild about this beer! Big, boozy and full of bravado, it's jut as the name implies!

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Pours oily black....smell is intoxicating: Bourbon, oak, vanilla, cloves, coconut, and specialty grain blissfully hit your noise.     Tastes of the same smells that reward your taste buds with a smooth bourbon treat. Slow alcohol heat so infused with the oak that you really enjoy it, leaving you wanting more. Probably this beers only weakness.  Finish is rewarding with a vanilla malty  bourbon after glow.    really really good...treat yourself.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Poured from a glass into a standard shaker pint glass.    L: Pours a beautiful midnight black with only a hint of brown when held in the light. Minimal head--the same as most other porters--with a bit of lingering lace.    S: Overwhelmingly bourbon, but not too much. There is actually more bourbon on the nose than on the tongue. Bittersweet chocolates, too.    T: Wonderful taste--but probably the weakest point of this otherwise incredible beer. A hint of bourbon, but not as much as I expected. Sweet, creamy vanilla finish, but I also got a strange metallic-y taste in the first couple of swallows.    F: Full body with a pleasant, lingering aftertaste. Not as heavy as I prefer my stouts and porters to be--a little syrupy.     O: This just became one of my favorite beers (although my wallet whined a little). But the 11% ABV ensures that I won't be drinking many in one session. Well done, New Holland! Well done!

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 This imperial stout lives up to its name, at 11 percent alcohol content it's a real kicker. The taste is a bit stringent, especially for a stout. Hints of nut and vanilla, with a truly knock-down coffee flavor and cocoa. Not too charred, and surprisingly smooth on the nose. This beer is one wild ride.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Pours extremely dark brown with a small-to-medium head that has good retention and leaves spotty lace. Nose is a bit like booze-soaked cake with cocoa, but is a bit light for what's expected. Taste is about the same...also a bit light (for an 11% ba stout) with some rough edges in the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin (again for an 11% ba stout). Overall, a reasonable beer for the price and being ba, but a bit disappointing.

The aroma is all boozy and malty.    The taste is a huge malt and hops and boozy bomb, with the booze taste definitely enhanced by the bourbon barrel taste.    The aftertaste is sweet and alcohol related. This is highly recommended if you were looking to have a very strong boozy experience.

Flavor: pleasant sweetness all the way through; cream; alcohol; whiskey flavor (I guess bourbon); roasted malt; oak; a chocolaty aftertaste. Bitterness is minimal.     Mouthfeel: medium-to-heavy, syrupy; lightly and pleasantly carbonated.     Finish: slick, syrupy, savory.     This is, overall, one of the best beers money can buy, in my humble opinion. If you have access to it, I highly suggest you give it a try.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 L-The beer pours a dark black with a mocha 2 finger head. Lacing is excellent and the head recedes to a thin film.  S- The bourbon is extremely strong on this one. There is some dark chocolate behind all the bourbon, but it is certainly playing second fiddle here.  T-The bourbon isn't quite as dominant here as it is in the nose. Because of this you get a little more chocolate than the nose. Still not overly complex. Almost no hop bitterness here. Really quite warm in terms of alchohol.  F- Despite the large head and prominent lacing the beer is thinner than I would have expected.   O- While not overtly bad, there are many other better bourbon barrel stouts out there. I probably would not buy this again given other choices.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Bottled 7/30/16.     Starts off a pour of chestnut brown developing into a deep, dark chocolate color. Head is 1 finger in the snifter and mocha colored.     Aromas from the bottle weigh heavily on chocolate and bourbon barrel; agitation in the snifter yields fusel alcohol, peanut butter-chocolate, dark fruits, and light grain. Mostly distilled alcohol though.    I'm not really picking out a focal point here in the flavor; I'm just getting a lot of stouty flavors like anise, dark chocolate, fermented prunes, candy bar, fusel alcohol, and hot bourbon. Dragon's Milk is tasting like a stouty mess so far, with no real focus.    The feel is much lighter than expected, somewhat watery, definitely missing the boozey hotness of other BBA stouts.     Overall, I'm super happy that I only spent $3.69 on ONE of these, and not $8 on a big one, or $14 on a four pack. This is easily one of the poorest BBA stouts I've had. Is it drinkable, yes. Is it memorable, not really!

Aroma is boozy and malty with bourbony peat.    Flavor is sweet up front with chocolate malts. The bourbon comes through from idle to end but it's balanced and doesn't overwhelm the flavor of the beer.    Mouthfeel is full bodied and low in carbonation. Alcohol is fairly well hidden for an 11%abv.    Overall a good imperial stout with well judged bourbon character.

The aroma is bready and sweet with molasses and Snicker bar. In the background I pick up a coffee wiff that reminds me of drinking a black Russian.     The flavor is astounding with all of the above aroma notes mixed with a hint of vanilla and licorice.     The mouthfeel is smooth with little carbonation.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 22oz bottle - thanks to my houseguest Chris for schlepping this one back from Michigan, via Seattle, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.    This beer pours a solid black, with three fingers of puffy, finely foamy, and somewhat creamy brown head, which leaves some frothing ocean swell lace around the glass as it swiftly sinks away.    It smells of bready and doughy caramel malt, grainy toffee/treacle, bittersweet chocolate, earthy anise, surprisingly subtle barrel notes (wet wood, rye booze, and understated vanilla), and a mixed dark orchard fruitiness. The taste is big cocoa-forward caramel/toffee malt, cafe-au-lait, black licorice liqueur, a still subdued Bourbon barrel character - vanilla pods, acrid staves, and a lesser rye graininess - reduced brown sugar, marshmallows, and more blended black fruit (cherries, bruised apple, and plums).    The bubbles are pretty laid-back in their hard to fathom at times frothiness, the body a solid medium-heavy weight, and mostly smooth, that mild Kentucky barrel essence maybe keeping things just beyond the ideal. It finishes bordering on sweet, the caramel, toasty vanilla, cocoa, and yeah, booze, keepin' 'er tight.    Overall, a decent Imperial milk stout, as it were, the barrel treatment underwhelming at best (ok, the vanilla character surely comes through), and easy enough to drink, especially given the 22-proof booze. I've never seen Game of Thrones, so I'll suggest that this is best imbibed whilst watching some vintage Lord of the Rings.

The first sip is the best, when the Bourbon aromatics rise on the fume of alcohol.    Hugely alcohol tasting. It tastes like a whiskey drink with a splash of stout. Medium body. Some malty sweetness but it's quite acidic.    An interesting variation on the Bourbon Barrel theme, but I would never drink this one again. Just about too hot to drink, but very slow sipping preserves the tonsils while taking tread off the dental enamel. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Bine & Vine in San Diego.

There is caramel and some bourbon at first giving a bit of sweetness but the finish is more roasty and bitter with a bittersweet caramel and bourbon aftertaste. Body is on the heavy side but not really as thick as other BBA imperial stouts. Overall I think it's a really good "beginner" barrel aged stout. Easy to get but well made and tasty.

Poured from the bottle into a snifter, the head is two fingers thick accompanied by a nice tan/khaki hue, with lateral lacing, and an extreme dark brown /black body.    I smell a pleasant, "do-able" amount of the bourbon notes upfront that morph into a roasted malt metropolis laden with structures of coffee, chocolate, toffee, and dark fruits like plums, raisins, and figs.    Tastes like a smooth, subtle bourbon note backed up with a very delicious chocolate, vanilla, and coffee. Yes indeed, that bourbon is not booze bombing the rest of this beer' other elements. I'm almost leaning in the direction that it's almost got an "Irish coffee" thing going on here as well. Interesting...    The mouthfeel here is heavier with mild carboation. I rated this so high due to a virtually unnoticeable alcohol warmth combined with the bourbon notes' masterful use restraint to allow the other complexities stand out and be noticed.     Overall, I'll give Dragon's Milk | New Holland Brewing Company a 4.75. I really wish more BBA stouts would have this near-perfect (still have to find my "5er") amount concerning the use of the bourbon flavoring.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 I'm sold.  Deep dark, almost purple, black body floating 1 in. tan head.  Inviting cocoa aromas with stone fruit. The flavor shares chocolate and stone fruit with a pleasing alcohol note. High abv, but very little heat. Nice.  Medium to heavy mouthfeel is perfect for the style.  I'll have another, please...and then probably a ride home.

Taste is dulled but very subtle bourbon flavors, notes of vanilla and even a bit of cocoa. Oak lingers at the end. Finish very clean but lingers on the palate. This is a great barrel aged stout. Although KBS is the king this is a nice substitute for those who can't get it. Would buy again to quench my KBS thirst.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 12 oz bottle. Pours black, thin tan head fades to a ring, little lace. Aroma of bourbon and wood, a little vanilla. Taste is also full of bourbon and oak, roasty chocolate as well but the oak barrel dominates. Very dry finish with some vanilla coming out in the end. Mouthfeel a little thin for a stout, oily. Overall decent BA stout.

The one-inch tan head is nice and thick, with good retention and lacing.    S: 4 Aromas are nice with mild bourbon, vanilla, molasses roasted malt, and chocolate. The barrel seems to add a bit of damp oak, which I’m not really a fan of in BA stouts.    T: 4.25 Really nicely balanced on the flavor. Starts off a bit sweet with molasses, brownies, and vanilla before moving into roasted malt and coffee. A bit of bourbon rounds things out with more vanilla and a little (fortunately less) damp oak from the nose. The finish is slightly bitter, but lingers like quality dark chocolate.    M: 4.25 Body is a little thin for my preferences, but it definitely helps drinkability. Carbonation is very nice.    O: 4.25 For the price and how easy this beer is to get, it may become a staple in my fridge. The aromas aren’t the best, but the balance of the flavors and drinkability make up for it.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pours pitch black with a tan head, you can smell the roast and bourbon right away. They specifically mention vanilla on the bottle and I get a ton of that and a lot of bourbon too. That isn't a bad thing though, I found it to be really good and for this to be a year round offering is outstanding. I grabbed a bottle in Georgia because we don't see it here in Florida and if we did, I would buy it very often.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 For me its just another BBS. Nothing ground breaking and after I had some exotic BBS in Vegas this one would be on the low end. Pours dark like midnight while you get those strong hits of the BB. Minimal head when poured due to the heaviness of the stout.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 Bought this beer with intentions of drinking after a midnight shift. The thought was one and done, and enjoy it. This beer did that with its 11% alcohol. The taste is what surprised me, it was good. You could smell chocolate and bourbon when the beer was cracked open. The other reviews were not lying when they said, "you could get drunk off this beer by smelling it." The taste is magnificent. Upfront you get carmel, chocolate, and malt. The finish is boozy like bourbon, but very smooth. It's a pleasant and drinkable high octane beer. I'd drink it again and suggest it in the future. Nice job New Holland.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 First tried this one a while ago when New Holland Brewing was a smaller operation and it certainly is not small anymore. This is a unique beer, guaranteed to "put hair on your chest" as they say. It is a talk dark pour - and what you see is what you get. Very bold, rich flavors, with a bourbon flair to it and even that hint of chocolate. The taste hangs around in your mouth - for better in the beginning, for worse in the end.     I can see why a lot of people would be drawn to this beer - gives the all around experience and tries to fit into this niche, however I think it would be middle of the road if stacked up against other similar brews.

I'd describe it as a BBS light. Light body, light on the "scotchy" vanilla, light color at the rim, light on the chocolate, raisin, anise, molasses, and everything else that I like to find in a BBS. Fairly pronounced acidity and roasty bitterness on the finish. That may have been the last bottle I will ever drink.

Onto the review:    Poured into a Guiness glass and served cold    Look: Jet black with a nice fluffy and retaining head; beautiful.    Smell: Strong bourbon & chocolate. In that order. feel i could get drunk by just smelling this beer! well it is 11% alchohol, afterall.    Taste: Bourbon. bourbon bourbon bourbon! With a nice malt backbone and delicious chocolate aftertaste. Thick and creamy; just right! The alcohol is very prevalent in this brew    Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy! VERY creamy. unlike anything I've ever had to be honest! I now understand why its called Dragon's Milk :)    Overall: Impressed! An excellent barrel aged beer! outstanding! i enjoyed every sip i had of this one. For a guy who prides himself in how much he can drink, this 11% alcohol ain't no joke! I am very impressed by New Holland and they seem to really know what a craft beer is. Will definitely buy again and am looking forward to trying more brews from them. Cheers!

Had this one on Thanksgiving and it was pretty hot; its definitely mellowed out, but at the expense of some of the barrel flavors.    Smell of oak and vanilla, lots of bourbon, plenty of alcohol showing up in the nose.    Taste is similar, with strong roasted malts, vanilla and lots of oak up front. Sweet bourbon and booze show up later. Not picking up much bitterness.    Feel is somewhat thin for this size beer, but its got some life to it, mild carbonation and dry finish.    Overall, this is a great year-round offering and a good entry point for bourbon barrel beers.

Pleasant aroma. Body was a little thinner than I expect from a stout. Strong hit of bourbon at the front with a very sharp note of alcohol shortly afterwards that I've not had from other BA beers. Finish was smoother but lingered for too long for my tastes.     *Editing* Have since been working on the other three bottles from the 4-pack I bought. Much smoother results and getting a smooth, creamier feeling. Slight notes of vanilla flavor, sweet with a hint of a dark roast. I'll take it the first bottle was just a dud, thankfully.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 This bourbon-barrel-aged imperial stout has the requisite black body, sparkling and orange-litten, and a brief-lived medium pebbly tan head leaves good bands and cavelets of lacing. The nose is medium in intensity: a tasty blend of molasses, cocoa and bourbony booze atop a more subtle oak character. On the palate, it is a bit more assertive, but still in keeping with the nose: a seamless, fairly rich blend of milk chocolate, molasses and toffee, backed by a fairly boozy bourbon flavor and subtle oak notes. In net, it lands a bit on the sweet end of the balance. The finish is surprisingly clean, just a modest hit of toffee; the linger is a mild, tartish, thin chocolate/oak flavor that stays around for a few minutes. The mouthfeel is on point for the full body, and is slightly warming; the texture is nicely sticky/creamy, with just a hint of pepperiness from the restrained carbonation. (12 oz bottle, 51 days after pkg)

T: Follows nose with a nice shot of bourbon into dark chocolate, vanilla and molasses. Roasty and smooth.    M: Medium with medium, thick carbonation.

I can get this down but not an enjoyable time. I don't get this aging trend. I don't like shots in my beer. lets get this over with so I can have something good.

Medium body, light for a stout, light heat from the alcohol and pretty clean finish. The flavors are simple, straightforward and fit the bill for an easy to acquire barrel aged stout. The body is thin and the mouthfeel suffers, lacking the creamy and full feel of a truly great stout. It's not the best but it isn't trying to be.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Picked up a 2015 edition at the local Bevmo, for $9.99 a bomber. Heard many a good thing about this beer so absolutely had to try it.  A - pours nearly flat with a very small head that drops to a ring with no retention. I've come to expect this of BBA beers, so no real knock there.   S - aromas of bourbon, wood, chocolate, roast and plenty of dark fruits.  T - tastes roasty, with plenty of dark fruits. As the beer gets warmer, the bourbon and chocolate begin to come through.   F- thinner mouth feel than the 11% abv would suggest. Almost medium full, but not quite :)  O - overall a good BBA stout at a reasonable price. Will Crack open the other bottle in 6 months and report back.    Time to report back.  Re-review, sampled second bottle (2015 edition, bottled Feb 2016). At this point in time, the beer is 10 months old.  A - A vigorous pour yielded 2 fingers' width of offwhite head that receded into a thin ring that lasted the full distance.  S - Dark fruits, raisins, prunes, lively pomegranates, roasted malts. This is more characteristic of a belgian dark ale than a rich imperial stout.  T - Everything promised in the smell, plus a generous dose of brown sugar. This is closer to a BBQ than a BBA-IRS.  M - Medium. I think the 11% ABV has been achieved by the addition of some simple sugars, instead of just malt. For comparison: Ten fidy, Bells expedition and Founders IRS are all sub-11% ABV, but have a more malty character than this beer.  O - If this were a blind taste test, I would have sworn that I was drinking a Belgian dark ale, or BBQ or even a barrel-aged scotch ale. Imperial stout...not so much. A good beer none the less, and an excellent bargain for a 4-pack at $18 or thereabouts.  Rating - As an imperial stout - 3.95/5, as a BBQ or Scotch ale - 4.3/5.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours black, with a medium-thin khaki head. Short head retention with only a handful of lacing dots left behind. Deep roasted malts, vanilla, and oak make up a dark aroma. Taste is sublime, with roasted malts, vanilla, oak, and bourbon. Feel is thick, and smooth. Not the most creamy or robust though. Overall, a sublime imperial stout. Readily available, and pleasant to drink give this one high regards for me.    Served in a 12oz snifter.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Tasted from a 12 oz bottle into a wine glass (the best I had in a hotel room).    L - Dark brown color and clear when held up to the light. Head is off-white and not persistent.    S - Great aromas of chocolate, vanilla and oak. I have to use my imagination to detect bourbon whisky in the background. Aromas not as assertive as some in this style.    T - Sweet, malty flavors dominate. I get bread, chocolate, low coffee and low bourbon whisky. No hops or yeast notes evident, as expected.    F - Medium to thick body. Low but creamy carbonation. Moderate alcohol burn. Hops bitterness keeps the sweetness at bay, but bitterness is not a factor that comes to the forefront.     O - A great bourbon barrel stout but not as huge and complex as some.

Let's put it this way: the Battle of My Bulge can no longer be won by having both dessert and an imperial stout. Having to chose just one, I'd go with the stout I know.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 L: Pours dark, but not quite motor oil. A very small dark-brown head that dissipates quickly.    S: Coffee, chocolate, dark fruit, and BOOZE. You can really smell the bourbon on this one, but it doesn't overpower.\    T: There's a lot going on here, but it's not overly complex. The chocolate and vanilla hit the tongue at the very beginning, and it finishes with bourbon and cold brew coffee. The alcohol is definitely there, but it doesn't have that "sting" that a lot of bourbon barrel stouts are notorious for. Sweet, but not too sweet. A magnificent balance.    F: One of the creamiest, thickest stouts I've had. Feels great on the tongue and all the way down.
