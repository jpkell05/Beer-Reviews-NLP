look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12oz bottle bb 8/21/23 poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at fridge temp 9.1% ABV. The beer pours dense very dark brown with milk chocolate colored head. The head recedes to a thin ring and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is a mixture of bitter chocolate, roasty malts and earthy hops. The taste is bitter first with coffee, dark chocolate, ash and some earthy hop flavor coming out after the initial shock. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish. Overall, good. Big bitterness here, but no trace of the high ABV. I might enjoy this more at the best by date 4.5 years from now than I do today at 6 months old.

Appearance: Dark dark brown to black in colour with a thin mocha head that dissipated fairly quickly and left some sparse lacing.    Aroma: Piney hops, roasted malts, chocolate and coffee.    Taste: Roasted malts, piney hops, chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, light herbal and a hint of liquorice.    Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium bodied with soft carbonation.    Overall: A nice Imperial Stout, although I’m not too fond of the liquorice and herbal mix on the finish.

The aroma has some dark chocolate mixed with some hop citrus (orange?). As time goes on, the citrus fades and there is some coffee undercurrent noted. The taste hits with a big blast of burnt roast, followed by some anise and espresso notes, with some citrus and piney hops noted in the finish and aftertaste. As it warms, the espresso qualities are more apparent, but the hop finish does not disappear. The mouthfeel is medium, carbonation medium low . An interesting concoction. A hoppy stout if you will. I wonder what it would taste like in 2023.

Aroma is dark roasted caramel, chocolate and a hint of coffee with a dominate floral hop note. Taste is chocolate milk, coffee with a slight burnt quality, lots of roast and a bitterness that runs from front into the aftertaste. It has a huge hop character for the style. A very nice but different stout.

Sticky on the tongue... medium bodied... more roast character and bitterness at the finish.    O: An outstanding Imperial Stout. Roast, coffee, dark chocolate, and hops playing very nicely together. A really super beer from Victory.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 Storm King from Victory     The look is black, maybe some dark brown around the edges. Nice one and a half finger head with some amazing lacing left behind. The aroma is hops, pine, floral, maybe some orange rind. Taste is more of the same, with an underlying layer of very dark, bitter, almost like bakers chocolate before it’s been cooked. Mouthfeel is not quite fully full but definitely fuller than medium. Its got a drying finish I assume from the amount of hops used. Overall this reminds me of fresh yeti, very hoppy and bitter. But I think I like my stouts better without as much hop presence. Maybe this will be better in 2-3 years once the hops fade.    Once it warms up the hops fade a little and the stout flavors come out a little more. Infinitely better at room temp

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Its dark stout beer with a tan head. Smells smokey but there are also some floral, pine and citrus aromas too. Upon first sip the beer is abrasively bitter in a hop forward sense. There's little toasty cocoa and coffee flavors until the beer is allowed to warm. Once this beer hits 47-50 degrees it is at the sweet spot and the hops and stout qualities balance. Would like to try it on cask.

Thick, lasting light brown head that left tremendous lacing.    S---Sweet roasted malts dominate. There's actually some hop presence as well, which isn't ordinary for a stout.     T---Roasted malts dominate again. There's some bitter chocolate and light coffee notes. The coffee strengthens on the finish.     F---Not as thick as expected, but still full bodied.     O---This is a good one. An actual Imperial Stout that's not barrel aged. Almost too good to be true. Hard to believe I haven't had this one before. Will definitely pick this up again.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Label is stamped for best by date as '21 AUG 2023'.  Black colored body, with ruby red highlights when back lit. One finger of light tan head settles and sticks around as thin cap and thicker ring. Leaves behind some strings of lacing.  Aroma is roasted malts and floral hops. Has some chocolate and dark fruit smells.  Taste is roasted malts, some mild char, dark chocolate, and prominent floral hops. Some sweet dark fruit and vanilla participate. The end is, as described, the espresso darkness, not really bitter, but rich and thick.  Medium to full mouth feel. Good carbonation for style. Quite smooth throughout.  A hop heavy, rich tasting stout that provides some complex layers of taste.  It has been a few years since I sampled this, but previously, this was my favorite heavy hopped stout. The experience is as I remembered.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 4.25 At first glance the body appears to be dark black, but take a closer look, hold it up to the light, and it's actually the darkest brown you'll ever encounter. The head is meager, but stays along to the end.   The nose is incredible with dark chocolate, dank root cellar, licorice, and coffee beans.   The taste is all of the above, plus a surprising hop bite that comes across as a bitter espresso on the tail-end.   The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a imperial stout.   Overall a great brew.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 I put off this beer for a while because I heard it was too hoppy. I decided to be a little brave & give it a go to see how hoppy it is. This is actually not terrible hoppy at all for an imperial stout. The flavors are a little mild. I am getting some roasted malts and a little dark chocolate presence on the backend. Maybe they have improved on this beer over the years because I actually like it. Cheers! B

Mouth feel ok for a thin brown ale or IPA but not for a stout.    Overall not going back here. Pretty much a thin tasting stout with way too much IPA taste for the style.

Price: $2.52 with 10 percent off for a variety 6-pack   Purchased: Nov. 2, 2017  Consumed: Nov. 2, 2017  Reviewed as: American Double/Imperial Stout  Misc.: Enjoy by Aug. 28, 2022    Picked this up on my monthly visit to Bine & Vine, along with a bunch of other stuff. Picked it up without really knowing anything about it or a canned on date. Usually two no-no’s for me. Hoping to be surprised. Thought I liked Victory a little more until I just looked at my ratings. Only one of my eight previous reviews had at least a 4 and it was exactly a 4 (Headwaters Pale Ale). Quick look and most of these reviews were in 2011, my first year starting. Would certainly like to try a few of those again. Anyway, bottle read, “A thundering hop presence collides with massive espresso and dark chocolate notes in this full-bodied imperia stout.”     Poured a pitch black color with 3-to-4 fingers of khaki tan frothy head. Could see a few bubbles sneaking up along the sides of the glass. World-class spiderweb foamy lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.50)    Smelled dark chocolate syrup, mocha, malt chocolate, caramel, hazelnut, espresso, char wood, burnt coffee, roasty malts and crayon. Had me wanting to try it. (Smell - 4.00)     Taste followed the nose for the most part, but no hiding that 9.1 pct. ABV. Got dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, char wood, toasty hazelnut, burnt coffee, dark cacao powder, roasted barley, anise and burnt popcorn. (Taste - 4.00)    Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt bitter finish. (Feel - 3.75)    Just a solid double stout. Outstanding. (Overall - 4.00)    4.01 | 90 | A-   
look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 From bottle to tulip glass...pitch black with tan head. Moderate head retention with lingering lacing. Smells of licorice and wet espresso grounds. Hoppy and bitter on initial taste, but not unpleasant. Very coffee forward with less bitter chocolate taste. Mild alcohol notes. Feels thin and dry with a burned malt aftertaste - again, not unpleasant. Overall, a good pour, but not if you are looking for the creamy, smooth, malty stout.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Poured from 12oz bottle into Spiegelau Stout glass. No date.     L: Deep dark black, ruby edges, two finger tan head has great retention. Spectacular lacing.     S: Smells strongly of lactose, and some semisweet chocolate. Not very appealing to me.     T: Again a lot of lactose, with some semisweet chocolate, but follows into a roasty note that is not displeasing. Some alcohol is present. Not great but not terrible.     F: Light, watery, crisp, lingering roasty dryness.     O: Meh.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 The appearance is pitch black. A semi-aggressive pour yields a huge two-finger creamy tan head. The retention is moderate--after a few minutes, the head dies down to a thin half-finger tan film, but plenty of lacing is left behind.  The nose is big, roasted, and bitter. It smells of unsweetened baking cocoa, beef broth/soy sauce, wet dirt, black licorice, pine, star anise, coffee grounds.  The palate opens up with dark chocolate, a bit of toffee, blackberry, and molasses--just slightly sweet--before a massive wall of roasted malt and hop bitterness overtakes the palate. The dark chocolate transitions into baking cocoa, black licorice, star anise, and black coffee. Super hoppy as well, there's a ton of earth and pine. Slightly metallic as well, like copper. There's a bit of soy sauce and umami, but the massive bitterness steals the show, with the bitterness of black coffee, dark chocolate and pine leading long into the finish.   The mouthfeel is medium-full, nice and well-rounded, mostly full, but the lively carbonation makes it quite drinkable.  Overall, a really good stout. Dangerously drinkable. If you prefer your stouts burnt and bitter, this one's for you!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured black with a 3 finger frothy off white head. Heavy lacing is present. Aroma is like a chocolate malt shake with a hint of coffee. The taste explodes in your mouth racing through flavors of chocolate malt, roasted malt, black licorice, dark roast coffee and hop bitterness on the end that blows away the earlier flavors but makes you want to sip it again. The beer has a thick body, moderate carbonation and is a bit creamy. The hops are a bit too much for me in an imperial stout. But, this is a very interesting brew with complexity.

T - Dark roasted malt, alcohol, very roasty throughout and ends with a sharp piney lingering bitterness that scrubs some of the malt off the palate.    M - Big and robust with a creamy texture.    O - Just an outstanding stout, hands down. So glad this is available year around!

A: Smells fruity like raspberries and blueberries, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, also picking up some dark fruits like plum, smells very sweet for a double stout, it's probably the hops that are coming through and giving it a sweet, dark fruit aroma.     T: Dark fruit and berries come through really strong on the flavor, espresso, roasted malts, finish is dry with lots of espresso lingering in the aftertaste, as the beer warms the dark fruit and berries do recede but the flavor is still there.     M: Full bodied with very little carbonation, moderate amount of coffee-like bitterness, finish is very dry.     O: I can't get past that initial taste and aroma of dark fruits and berries, it's very sweet, almost taste and smells as if blueberries were added to the beer, it's not balanced compared to the beer's roasted, espresso, and dark chocolate notes.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pour is black-ish, looks almost like a big porter, plenty of light leaking around the edges, with a tan head.    Aromas are HEAVY hops, some sharp coffee, and chocolate. The taste is very hop forward - more so than I’ve experienced in any big stout, ever - with a lot of bitterness from the coffe flavors, and subtle chocolate notes.    And it works. It’s a bit thin for a 9.1% ABV beer, and it’s sorta like a black DIPA, but it works. Glad I finally got to try it.

Coffee and bakers chocolate up front in the nose, with molasses, plum and umami coming on strong as it warms.    Super rich, dark and bitter tasting. Roasted, almost smokey, chocolatey malts stand out at first once again. There's a strong wallop of fruit and umami, as well, maybe a flash of licorice, and then a hint of coffee, chicory and wood mid-palate. Chocolate/ coffee bitterness lingers in the aftertaste.    Nice, full-bodied, creamy feel.    The umami could be dialed down half a notch, but overall, this is delicious.

The taste is very robust, loads of sweet malt with a light bitter chocolate, some coffee and oak flavors and very mild hops. Some alcohol bite but not too bad, as it warms it softens with more pronounced flavors. Medium to heavy feel.

I know it wasn't me because i had everyone at the table sample my glass.     Appearance -The pour was ok. Nice head. Dark chocolate appearance.   Smell - Like a wet Juggalo that's been festering in the back seat of a taxi without air-conditioning for a few hours.  Taste - Imagine the same Juggalo in the middle of a field of burning tires, you open your mouth to breath and swallow the Juggalo-tire smoke. Stayed with me for way longer than it should have.  Feel - Like greasy black death slid down the backside of a Juggalo and attached itself to the roof of your mouth.    I will try it again just to make sure this was a one off.

The body is too dark for any carbonation to be seen rising. Some nice spotty yet spider web lacing speckles the sides of the glass. The smell has a spectacular blend of nice roasty malty with a slightly hidden sweetness that has a slight sugary brown molasses with some nice hops. The taste is slightly bittersweet maltiness with the previously mentioned aromas in the flavoring adding some great roasty coffee coming out. On the palate, this is one exceptionally smooth RIS. Overall, big wow from me, I would definitely have this again.

A nice finger and a half of a light brown head that leaves nice lacing down the glass.    The smell is wonderful! Smells of perfectly roasted malts with some chocolate and and dark fruits. The roast is so close to perfect on the nose!    The taste is roasted malts and lots of hop bitterness with some rich coffee coming out. The hops are very prominent on the taste.    Mouth is medium with a wet finish that seems to leave a lingering hop bitterness on the palate.    This beer is not overly bad but does seem to have a clash of hop bitter that I did not care for. The perfectly roasted malt and coffee bitter were indactive to the style and greatly appreciated. The hops should have been left to a double or imperial IPA.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Looks okay. Poured from bottle into glass, dark brown with minimal head and minimal lacing, but a ring of foam that lingers. Smells good, though more like maybe a red ale or a bock with some toasted bread and moderate hops coming through. Also chocolate and coffee notes, as expected. Taste is similar, with hop bite and slight toastiness definitely coming through on the end. Feels slightly creamy with alcohol burn in the throat going down, though no offputting burn on the tongue. Unusual, and not entirely sure what the brewers were going for here. Not bad though.

This one is a bit tough for me to enjoy, the alcohol is quite present, I feel like I'm enduring a heavy whiskey mixed drink or something. I'm not so sure about the feel either, this one's a bit flat, which may be contributing to the difficulty drinking. Sorry Victory, this one didn't win me over.  *UPDATE* Storm king is very enjoyable, more so at room temperature with a bit of aeration. I catch hints of dark black cherry and roasted wood. And the carbonation is much better on this one.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 Another "holy shit" brew from Victory. These guys have a lineup that is among the best in the USA, I swear. Pitch dark black beer with a coffee, roasted malt, chocolate smell. Delivers as expected on the taste, giving you a decent bit of carbonation to make sure all that booze (9.1%) and intense flavor (detectable hops) goes down smooth. One of my favorite stouts to date. Killer buzz, killer beer, amazing brewery. Thank the stars they ship out to Texass. Warms my bones in an awesome, thought provoking way. What else can I say?!   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I haven't had many Victory brews, but this one might be my favorite...    I've seen plenty of stouts pour out a black liquid, but that was until today. This quite possibly might have be the blackest of them all, truly black, as in it poured black and it stayed black even when held up to the light - impressive in my book. The smell was a sweet booziness that honestly made my mouth water. Though it was more carbonated that I would have liked, it was certainly smooth and the carbonation wasn't as strong as it got warm. This could have been an opulent brew, if it were not for the hops they used that gave it a slightly metallic tang (and an even stronger one as an aftertaste.) Nonetheless, overlooking this one flaw, it really is a darn good beer. Too bad I only had one of these to partake.

Aroma after opening the bottle is all hops, which was a let down, not at all what I want to smell in an imperial stout, (unless of course it's billed that way). Taste is way too citrus and thin for being an imperial. I could taste the espresso and from what I could tell, the malt was a little over-roasted. Let warm for a bit, still way over the top hops for an imperial stout for my taste. I like Victory and respect their beer making, but, this would have been a drain pour had we not just had a blizzard and I couldn't make it to the store.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I can only rate this in the here and now, but the bottle has a best by date of February, 2017. Dont know what that translates to in terms of bottle date.    Poured into a tulip an inky black with a bit of beige stout type head that fell to nothing.    Aroma is certainly absent any hop character. It is fig/date brown dried fruit, molasses, coffee, roast malt, and a note I cant pick out from the smell alone.    The taste is quite smooth, coffee, dried sweet fruit, brown sugar, molasses. There is an aftertaste that becomes easy to pick out as the beer warms, and it is licorice. Generally not a flavor I like in a stout, but this is in the aftertatse and it is clear but not overwhelming candy. More like licorice root or fennel.    The feel is oily, minimal carbonation, slick and smooth with the spicy note of the licorice livening things up.    Overall,this is a very good stout as consumed. I cant comment on a fresh bottle. Very good and would not hesitate to age this one even further.

look: 3.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 Appearance: black but with little translucence in the light. The head is a off-colored white that is thin and dissipated quickly. No lacings around the glass.    Aroma: hops, hops, and more hops. I do not pick up the common notes of coffee or chocolate. Just very earthy forward hops.     Taste: hops comes in fierce but there are subtle chocolate malt in the back. Overall, very bitter and earthy. Very strong bitter hops in the aftertaste.    Mouthfeel: medium bodied with the right amount of carbonation.     Overall: this beer takes after a black IPA, not an imperial stout. I've tasted beers labeled "black IPA" that tasted more like a stout than this beer. I would say go easy on the hops but since this beer has been around forever, clearly people like this and I'm in the minority.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 Poured in a traditional spiegelau glass. First time trying this beer, and I enjoy sampling imperial stout styles. Pours a dark brown to black body with a two finger frothy tan head with visible carbonation bubbles on the top. Initial aromas of roasted malts, fresh hop fuitiness, and burnt coffee. Subtle notes of dark chocolate when doing several of the smell tests. First taste, that fine roasted dark malt sweetness, significant whole cone hop profile that zings you right away which I found to be kind of surprising. Well blalanced though, and bitter/dry on the end. The mouthfeel is the winner in my opinion.. especially when the beer warms a bit more. This beer should NOT be drank super cold. Smooth, lightly carbed, and dry/bitter finish that you can really taste the addition of the whole cone hops for sure. Its a bit different then some of the other types of Imperials I've tried, but certainly well crafted by the brewers at Victory. Overall the 9.1% alcohol content is hidden in this beer and is pretty well balanced despite the high level of hop presence.

BeerAdvocate shark jump, 2010 I think. . .     Anyways, this gem pours black as night. Without a moon. Hits that awesome over 1" of head, looking crimson deep burnt red on it. Aroma hit chocolate, roast, coffee notes.    This one floats seamlessly through the genres of stout, some irish dry aspect, the lactose in a small way of a milk stout, the heft of an imperial stout, the dark fruit of a russian imperial stout. Chewy, mild cherry tobacco notes. I have a barrel aged version I've been meaning to check out.     Anyways, classic stuff, no adjunct stout from back in the day.

Although there is a faint coating of milk chocolate and malt sweetness, the taste is dominated by bitter espresso and hops flavors. It chars the mouth and dries the palate, yet there is a creamy smoothness that evens things out. The body is on the high side of medium. Is there alcohol in this? Yes there is, yet, I didn't notice it was so well masked.  An interesting stout that is on the hoppy side.

The finish is very bitter but it isn't lingering. It hits you with a pleasant hoppy bitterness that doesn't stick around to long. At $8 a four pack I should have bought more, unfortunately victory isn't available in my state so I'll have to wait for another chance to buy this.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 From bottle at Home. Enjoy by 27 Jan 2121. Being a big stout fan, I figured I'd pick this up with no referral. There's the usual deep ebony hue with a sturdy, moderate head. The first sensation is a very strong coffee influence. The texture is less then the look or aroma has lead me to anticipate. The bitterness is way up front with a moderate coffee followup. Missing are the usual depth that toasty malts & any lacto traits would add. Some vague chocolate shows on warming but IMO, it's not enough.

S- Roasted coffee, dark chocolate, burnt brown sugar.     T- Follows the nose, with some bitter roasty hops coming in and pairing with that deep, rich chocolate sweetness in a decadent, bittersweet glass of heaven for stout lovers. Very very bitter, the kind of bitterness that lingers on the tongue for hours afterward, and a pleasurable palate wrecker. Hides the ABV very well though. This isn't a beer for the faint of heart, but there's an amazing layer of sweetness hidden beneath the bittering hops.    F- Fairly thick body, much more full bodied than expected. Slight carbonation, pretty creamy.    O- One of my top 5 stouts of all time, and possibly my favorite when all factors are considered. This is an absolutely beautiful creamy, sweet, bitter masterpiece that is a bit more like a black IPA than a traditional stout. I don't care what you call it though, I just think it's amazing.

Okay fine, here's another beer I'm going to be biased with... tan creamy foam head.    Smell (4): Roasted coffee and milk chocolate notes are prevalent. That part is so overwhelming it's hard to get anything else except maybe some heavy alcohol.    Taste (3.75): Milk chocolate is big and upfront. Citrus grapefruit and piney background notes. Roasted coffee malt throughout.    Mouthfeel (4.25): Creamy but course on the backend. Medium plus to full bodied. It's funny, I remember it being alot thicker... still, a nice long bitter finish. On the sweeter side but still pretty dang close to being balanced.    Overall (4): This beer will always hold a special place in my heart.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours black, with a think, foamy, creme colored head. Great appearance right off the bat. A bit of lacing is left behind as well. Roasted malts, and a twinge of coffee form the aroma. Alcohol starts to show through as the beer warms up. Smooth introduction of roasted and toasted malts , with notes of coffee, and chocolate as well. Robust and filling mouth feel round this beer out nicely. Overall, a great imperial stout! Plenty going on, and yet it remains highly drinkable. Mouth feel isn't as bold as I would hope for in an Imperial Stout, but it still works well.    Served in a 12oz snifter.

Well marketed with wide distribution, Storm King is easy in the top 10 reviewed, yet its ratings are not in the top 100.  Despite having a 92, I find it undistinguished... principally because the burnt malt and hops steal the show.    This is listed on the "1001 Beers" and, arguably, should not be there.

Not quite black color, with a two-finger, light tan head that quickly dissipates to about a centimeter. It smells amazing. Sweet burnt sugar or molasses is the heavy scent up front, ending smoky and a bit roasty as well, its hard to take your nose out of this guy. Sort of reminds me of coffee and pecan pie. The taste though, has almost none of the characteristics of the smell. The flavor is almost exclusively burnt malts, with hardly any sweetness or smokiness. Not much depth to the taste; I was honestly a bit underwhelmed. The mouthfeel is fine, medium to slightly thicker.    I was excited to try this when I saw it, being a stout/porter guy (and a fan of Victory), but truthfully, I wasn't really impressed. Not that it's bad in any way, it's a fair beer in its own right and it smells like heaven, but the taste leaves a lot to be desired. It lacks complexity which, in today's craft beer scene, isn't likely overlooked.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 1.5 | feel: 2 | overall: 2.25 Ouch, a very harsh beer. There are remnants of something big here, a overlooked work of high art, a great dream... but no more than remnants.     It begins with the visual claim to and bold evocation of the form of the imperial stout. Perhaps ,to some, the imperial stout is unsurpassable, known as a grand effort and gesture in brewing, the longest throw. Storm King's owl icon art paired with the Victory Brand label deliver a formidable nod in this deep, dark beer tradition and aesthetic, one shared and partaken of by many, as evidenced by the thousands of hads on this drink. This beer is opaque, dark, black. It fills any drinkware quickly, and like oil. At pour, a 3 inch, tense, dense, slow boil of foam appears, tan-brown and perpetually lingering. Smell-wise, there is much promise here. Familiar, metallic, astringent aromas bound forth, heavy hops and malt, very complex and balanced, leaning here towards Russian Imperial style in figgy, oaky, vanilla smokiness yet still aggressively hoppy. Taste is where it all goes down for me in this Pennsylvania beer, and not necessarily in a good way. The flavor, if you will, comes on very well, very strong, porter-esque and buildling, and then just kind of flops. Pine, hops, malt, and brazen, syrupy, molassesy, yeasty, worty tastes take center-stage here. Unfortunately, despite summoning all of these exciting notes, what came next to tongue and mind was a seriously unpleasant, out-of-control black pepper, and way over-roasted malt. Now, again, I like the olefactory elements of this beer, which pulled the taste up from a serious 0 to a 1.5, but where the smell promises, the taste under-performs. The alcohol scrambles and overwhelms to compensate and fails. The taste itself brings nothing to enjoy for me over the course of one of these 12 oz'ers. The flat, thin, sourness both introduces and gives way to a slick, pulpy, rind-y mouthfeel, with a bit of an elmer's glue problem of an after-presence.    Speaking of bottles, considering the notably low carbonation of this beer, I thought if poured into a nice new can-glass (maybe foolish), maybe it would mellow out towards something like a nitro feel? Nah, it just went flat :(.     By now you may have gathered that I didn't love this beer, and after a 4-pack, I didn't really have any beatific experiences to relate from or while drinking it. But look, just because I don't love it, doesn't mean I hate it. In fact I even like it, because I like all beer, but in this review's frame, I would not considerate to be among the pleasurably drinkable strong beers. Overall, this is not really a recommendable imperial stout, by me, at this point in time. Maybe tweak this one, Victory? Thanks for reading, and keep on, fellow stout/imperial stout lovers!

Tan 1.5 inch bubbly, creamy head from a moderately agressive pour that recedes slowly, lumpily, leaving thick lacing, eventually becoming a thin collar. Overall, an excellent looking stout. Aroma is sweet fruits, a hint of chocolate, coffee, roastiness. Thick feel with little carbonation. Taste starts out with dark fruits, roasty malts, and transitions to a nicely balanced bitterness in the finish. It is true that the level of hops bittering is greater than would be the style standard, but it works very well in this big beer. Moderate booziness remains in the back of the mouth and the throat. This is a very tasty, wonderful imperial stout. Well balanced between the sweet dark fruits and roasty malt and hops bittering. Perhaps a bit more booze evident than you'd expect for 9.1% ABV, but nonetheless, highly recommended.

However, it was surrounded by 5-6 beer tastings on either end and I thought it wasn't a fair assessment. I was right.    Very dark/black in color; creamy tan head, mild roasty aroma, a little too much hop flavor and bitteness in a stout for my liking, which I believe is the weak link for this bottle. complex flavors, dark chocolate, coffee, malt; alcohol could be hidden slightly better, but overall a pretty good imperial stout

Lacing is just gripping onto the .    S - Thick licorice and dark chocolate. The dark cacao is very prevalent. Just by scent, you know this is a big beer.     T - Really dark chocolate with bit of alcohol on the finish. Almost like a licorice beer.     F - Medium-heavy in body, the alcohol sets this back to make this a slow-sipper. Big beer all the way    O - Awesome quality for the price tag. I got this on-sale for $8.99, which for an imperial stout is pretty good. Big, strong, and dark pretty much describes Storm King. I'll have to stash some of this for the winter months. Cheers!

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Storm King pours jet black with a slow forming brownish head. Not much lacing to speak of, bottles dated enjoy by sometime in 2020. Fresh still! Drunk from a snifter. A nice mix of roasty-ness and sweetness, but not overwhelmingly either. No alcohol presence whatsoever. It's a very solid imperial stout, quite tasty, but I wouldn't put it in the same league as some of my other favorites in the style (Expedition, Ten Fidy, Founders).   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 One of the darkest and roastiest regularly available imperial stouts around, and easily the hoppiest and most bitter. The combination of big, bitter hops and dark, dark roast coffee is really off the charts. I love it on the nose, with the licorice, rye bread, baker's chocolate, and dark fruit compliments. But on the tongue it's a bitter, cold-pressed coffee bomb. There are bitter chocolate and peaty notes, but it's really all about the bitter coffee and hops. Different but a little too bold.

Best before January 16, 2020.    Appearance - pours an ominous black coloured beer with a finger and a half of a beige frothy head. Modest head retention as after a few minutes a thin layer of foam remains. A thin curtain of lacing left behind.    Smell - chocolate, caramel and fruity citrus notes do innate at first. Some expressive coffee aromas a hint of molasses and vanilla come into play too. Booze is present on the nose.    Taste - a smooth and rich dark chocolate and coffee combination. Plenty of bitterness with just a slight citrus fruit accent. Long lasting bitterness. Some alcohol on the finish. Ashy charcoal flavours paper as the beer warms.    Mouthfeel - very smooth, velvet like texture and a pervasive creaminess that is delightful. Body is slightly chewy. Good carbonation. Slightly hot going down, I suppose this could be aged for a while still. Dry finish.    Overall - one of the better stouts I've had, storm king is decidedly aromatic and look great. The flavor profiles are what you've come to expect from a good stout, coffee, dark chocolate with notes of vanilla, although the lasting bitterness is very pronounced here. Definitely on a list of beers that you have to try once, simply for its excellent reputation and for the most part lives up to that rep. Glad I purchased the four pack, especially as winter approaches.

Storm King pours dense and black with a 1f British tan colored head. It's opaque, nothing visible through the darkness. The head tapers to a film and leaves web and spot lacing.     It smells like strong black coffee, espresso-like. Roasted malts, chocolate, and molasses sweetness and even some floral hop aromas float around. Warm alcohol.    It tastes like roasted and flavored Italian espresso with some sweetness and hops. It's coffee and malt in overdrive.    Lots of body, some hop bitterness separate form the roast bitterness. Semi-sweet.    I'm enjoying this experimental brew.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3.25 Spicy bitter hops on par with a hoptimum. Really not what I was expecting or looking for in a stout. I can't get past the hops enough to enjoy the malts well anything for that matter. Very unique more like a black ipa. I love hops and love ipas just not when I'm craving malted milk creamy sweet stout. I plan to put them in the fridge in my veggie drawer where all the other unbalanced bottles go to age and try it again in a year or so see if the malts take over...

Pitch black with great head and lacing.    S: Whoa, tons of grassy, citrusy hops backed up by bitter burnt malt. Lots of coffee and dark chocolate. A real bitter mess.    T: Follows the nose. Tons of grassy hops that linger long after consumption. Initial taste of darkly-kilned malts, but these pass almost immediately and give way to the hops.    F: Alright, exactly like other Victory brews (little watery).    O: Good beer. A classic.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 L: Frothy head, black as hell, really nice lacing.  S: Sweet creamy, with little bits of roasty qualities  T: Good, a I personally think it is a little over hopped for a stout. Stouts already have a bitter of a bitterness to them from the roasted malt, and these 2 aspects sort of multiple and make the beer a little too hoppy. Sort of throws the beer out of sink because it is very creamy and rich, and not "spritey" like an IPA. Otherwise, there is a bit of sweetness and creaminess that is quite nice in this beer.  F: Smooth, creamy. Only complaint is the beer is really astrigent, which isn't as nice with a heavy beer like this.   O: Good beer, definately will drink again but its definately a sipper, not something I can toss back like water (like most beers). Heavy and astringent, though there is nice flavor here.

Smells dark and roasty, coffee and chocolate, with some citrus/floral hops intermingled.    Taste follows smell, but the abundant hops and dark malts both have seperate profiles of bitterness that combine to make the overall flavor a but more bitter than I expect from a stout. Still tasty though.    Medium bodied with just enough carbonation to prickle and no noticeable alcohol.

Can't see through this beer at all. Poured around a 1 finger coffee and cream head which quickly dissipated.    S: Rich dark malt profile. Coffee, a little chocolate, and some toffee. This smells divine.    T: Dark roasted malts. Strong coffee flavor gives way to some malty sweetness and ends with some hoppy bitterness.    F: Smooth to drink. A little lighter on the mouth feel than I was expecting. Prepared myself for it to be a little more chewy. Coffee and bitterness linger around after a moderately dry finish. Very little to no alcohol burn for an Imperial Stout clocking in at 9.1% ABV.    O: I enjoyed this beer very much. I will be purchasing more to share, cellar, and enjoy immediately. If you like stouts, be sure to try this one out.

Appearance : Initially a brown pour from the bottle which turns into a dark chocolate colored body with 100% opacity. The head was almost gone by the time I sat down (which was about enough time to snap a picture and load it to Photobucket for WBAYDN; a 60 second procedure). It started out at about a finger high, which wasn't impressive to begin with. It has almost entirely dispersed across the top of the beer, and is even nonexistent in some places. Unfortunately I'll have to rate this just below the bar for par, normally a 4 for me.     Smell : Molasses and cookie dough. Burnt barley malts. Hint of hop leaf. Final note is scorched chocolate. The aroma overall is not really rich or decadent, but more funky and bizarre. Quite a few off-notes here.    Taste : Very roasted. The definition of roast in a stout. Coffee, torched chocolate, some hop oils, a pinch of tobacco, and a big finish of fresh coffee grounds. Set all of these flavors on fire, mix them together, and you have a good idea of Storm King. (edit : As it warms a bit, it becomes completely undrinkable. I'm pouring the rest of this one.) (second edit : had another one and it was burnt beyond drinking, dumped half of it. Adjusted scores accordingly.) 3rd trial : a bit better but mostly astringent with coffee and cocoa .    Feel : Fairly dense, mildly chewy, with a creaminess and zaps of carbonation to keep it lively.    Overall : This was not particularly enjoyable for me. The head on the beer disappeared quicker than the T-1000 regenerating from an injury. The aroma was not horrible, but was off in places. And the taste, while very big, was a bit too roasted and hoppy, taking away from the smoothness of an otherwise warming beer style. Once the beer had warmed a few degrees, a whole calvary of off-flavors surfaced and now it just tastes like fermented fruit and a mouthful of quarters soaked in motor oil.     Storm King needs some serious improvements to become even a decent choice for an Imperial Stout.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Definitely more black IPA than stout to my palate, this thing doubles down on a huge roasted malt presence with tons of bitter hops. It's a beast, but sometimes you can use a good kick in the pants.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 "This does not taste like a roasty coffee laced stout" That's what coffee stouts are for. This is a great example of stout made exclusively of grain. You do taste roasted notes, like in coffee, but they draw out the best in dark grain for this one. I think its one of the best examples of American stouts with no added flavors, almost tastes like an Ethiopian stout too, chocolaty and coffee like, but not fake. I like coffee and chocolate stouts, but it takes skill to make a beer that has those same flavors just from grain.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 This does not taste like a roasty coffee laced stout. This is a hoppy IPA tasting beer. Not really what I want when I want a stout. If it said IPA well than okay. For an IPA its good. For a stout its bad.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 This one was pretty meh for a well-renowned imperial stout. Initially not bad, although much stronger with grassy hops in the nose than most. Jet black with ok head retention. Taste is first and foremost of bitter, grassy hops like some not-so-good black IPA, followed by roasted malt and some charcoal. Not a ton of depth here, just two notes of char and hops. Not good. Feel is also too thin and heavily carbonated for the style. Not gonna bother with this one again.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Pours dark, with a very small caramel color head. Can't see any light going through the glass. The smell has a trace of fruit in it. At first it tasted hoppy, but after warming up the roasted malts took over.

Minty pine sticks to the background on the nose, but jumps up to the lead role on the palate (why??). The chocolate is still there, but irreparably marred.    M: On the thinner side, but still has that nice oily quality without too much prickly carbonation.    O: Good, but why the big hops? Can't we have a totally non-hoppy beer nowadays? Keep hops where they belong! Or at least let me know that I'm verging on black IPA territory.

Pours very dark as you'd expect and has some very distinct notes of coffee and chocolate with some lingering hop bitterness afterwards. It has a very full flavor compared to most stouts I've tried and gets better if you take your time to appreciate the different flavors it has going for it. Very recommended!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Picked up a single bottle as part of a build-your-own-sixer at my local Stein's Liquor. The enjoy by date suggests it's still good for almost four years. Poured at cellar temperature into my Samuel Smith pint glass.    L: Pours a deep coffee black with about three fingers of dense tan head that sticks around for a good while and leaves considerable lacing on the glass.    S: Roasted, toasty, and sweet caramel malts are all in play in the bouquet. On top of all this, there are definite citrus and (more sublte) pine hop notes. There's a bit of spice to this one, as well. I'm picking up some anise and the faintest sarsaparilla.    T: Sweet and roasty at the front end, with a very inviting malt profile. The middle brings on some of those hop and spicier notes from the bouquet, including the anise and sarsaparilla. Those hops work tremendously with the malts, proving some great complexity without losing balance. The back end has more of the hops, which provide a good bit of bitter on top of the sweeter malts. There's also just the slightest amount of clear alcohol coming through, but it's covered remarkably well by the lingering hop bitter aftertaste.    F: This one is pretty firmly medium-bodied. It has nice creaminess thanks to a good level of carbonation; it finishes with a bit of lingering bitter, but it's far from syrupy. If anything, this one could be a little thicker.    O: I haven't had a Storm King in some time, and I can't for the life of me figure out why. This is a great-tasting, complex stout that brings a good deal of ABV in a very unobtrusive way. This is one I'll be returning to more frequently.

Light to medium sweetness, medium to high bitterness. Initial sensation of metho then lots of roastiness and then the resinous bitterness kicks in. Medium bodied, creamy texture, noticeable alcohol burn and a very long roasted / bitter finish. Not feeling the love for this one. 6.

Perhaps its the very high ABV, but this beer is a VERY pungent, very sharp, robust flavor. You take a sip and need some time to recoil.     Feel: VERY thick and little carbonation, like a Guinness, but leaves a strong hoppy aftertaste.    Overall: I'm not sure. It's far too pungent for my taste in stouts/porters, but if you like really bold, intense beers, this may be for you.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 I first had this on draft and posted a rating but not a review. I'm not sure I did it justice so I'm reviewing it now. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into snifter. The color is jet black with a creamy, toffee-colored head and lacing. This is a classic looking stout. The smell is a pleasant cocoa/chocolate, caramel, and dark fruit. What a great taste: dark chocolate, malt, some sweet vanilla or toffee, some cherry/dark fruit, and a nice, hoppy bitter finish. It's the complete taste package for a stout. This is a medium-bodied stout with nice carbonation and the 9.2 ABV is not in your face. Overall, this is an excellent Imperial Stout; not quite at the Founders Imperial Stout level, but very good. I will enjoy this again at any opportunity. Thanks to Victory Brewing Company for an excellent offering.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 EBD 15jan 2020. Pours pitch black. Outstanding head volume and lacing, very good retention.    Rich nose of dark chocolate, sweet milk chocolate, light coffee and light roast.    Medium body with a creamy texture, but not in a viscous way. Superbly carbonated with effervescence from the middle on.    The outstanding flavor profile is intense, fairly complex and expertly balanced. It begins with bitter and sweet chocolate over notes of caramel. The middle brings a moderate bitterness of roast and hops and a nice bold hop flavor that is typically not present in imperial stouts. As the bitterness ebbs, light coffee is present over the strongest caramel influence. The finish is a slow fade of mixed flavors, with hops being the most discernible over caramel.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a snifter.    A - Poured jet black with a short but heavy tan head.    S - Bitter chocolate and carmelized sugar.    T - Huge roasty notes here, chocolate and espresso undertones and a hint of burnt sugar. Slight bit of hop bitterness near the back.    M - A little thin and carbonated for a stout, but nonetheless satisfying and smooth.    O - Rich and sweet, this stout is a great example of carmelized malt that doesn't overpower the brew. Very tasty.

I was expecting the hoppy bitterness to die off at some point but it has been pretty persistent. I'm a stout guy through and through, and Storm King is a solid imperial stout, however, I'm really not crazy about hoppy stouts. I'd categorize this beer as an imperial black IPA over an imperial stout. Semantics aside, it's absolutely worth checking out if you're into hoppy stouts. Even if you're not, it still has plenty of flavor and is worth cellaring for a little while

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 im shocked i have not reviewed this beer yet, this is an old classic, and one of my stand bys when i was living back east. its a genre defining stout for me, but distinct from the others that have come since it i think. its richer and more chocolaty than others, more fluffy in feel, and less harsh on the booze. if it wasnt for getting wasted, you could sip on these all day. its less sugary, at least in the finish, the sweetness there in the middle is replaced by a malty bitterness on the back end, dry cocoa notes, and an english sort of yeast profile thats usually absent in this style. i also think its one of the more hoppy stouts going, save green flash or something thats basically just black ipa. this one is hopped just right, built for bitterness, but it works with the dark roast and the chocolate in here, adding complexity. the feel is wonderful, maybe its best feature, where that raisiny caramel middle comes in, the beer gets milkshake thick and super creamy, a delightful sensation in a beer like this. no alcoholic hotness at all, and dry in the finish for how big it is. maybe the best beer victory makes, and definitely a trend setting that hit the scene long before it was the cool thing.

Milk chocolate, oak, some toffee, more rich roasted malts. It's a very rich smelling beer    T: whoa, I do believe I'm detecting hops. I didn't pick up any in the nose. They're just lending some earthy bitterness upfront. After those there is some bitter toasted malts, dark chocolate, fig, and a mild alcohol tinge    M: it's on the heavier side of medium. There's a little bit more carbonation in the mouth than I would have guessed from the head    O: hoppier than I expected. The rest of the flavors are luscious and roasted. It's a sipper, and with picking up a bottle, though I could use a touch less of the hops - but they're not detrimental

Lacing clings stubbornly in jagged, broken rings.    S: Fudge, molasses, bitter dark chocolate. Heavy roast. Mocha. Coffee with cream. Black licorice. Blackberries. Heavy dose of earthy, woody, and piney hops.    T: Brownie batter and fudge are soon overtaken by intense roasted malt flavors of woody char and French roast coffee. Acrid and smokey. Steely. Bitter dark chocolate. Berries. Aggressive hopping matches the intensity of the heavy roast with a high level of bitterness and lots of earthy, woody, and pine flavors. Citrus rind pulls through as well. Alcohol pulls through just barely. Chocolate cake, char, and earthy hops on a long bitter finish.    M: Thick in body with a lush and creamy texture that glides easily over the tongue. Whipped and airy and not sludgey or weighty in the least. Mild prickling carbonation. A mousse-like mouthfeel overall. Great.     O: Intense dueling bitterness between the hops and roasted malts. It's not unlike some of the bigger black ipas on the market at the moment. It's nice to sip in small doses, but it becomes palate-fatiguing after a while.

As others have noted in various forums, there is a "default" Victory taste profile. Hoppiness dominates that profile, regardless of the style of beer.    The outstanding imperial stouts I have had do NOT have a very hoppy profile. I love hops in beer, but there is a time and place for using hops. In this case, the highly hoppy taste works against the style overall.    The look is about as good as anyone can ask for - almost pitch black. But the smell exposes the high hops content. The bitter hops overwhelm any other smell - such as coffee, leather, and so on that one often gets in such a beer.    The taste isn't bad. It just doesn't taste much like an imperial stout. It tastes like Victory's brewmaster's take on an imperial stout - which may be exactly the intention. I just wish Victory would tone down the hops character in the case of this beer. Hops are great, but they don't make EVERYTHING taste better.    I bought a case of this, and I will enjoy it. It's far from drain pour. It's just not, in my estimation, an imperial stout.    UPDATE, 9-17-17  Tried this again. I'm still not wild about it. In fact, I like it less. Now the taste also has a "dirty" flavor to it. Dirty as in soily. It probably always had this, but for whatever reason I am noticing it more now. It's still an okay beer - barely. Still drinkable - barely. But I'm kind of sorry I picked up a 6-pack.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 12oz bottle into tulip    Appearance - Black as night, no light penetrates. A two finger dark tan head persists well and leaves lots of sticky lacing.    Smell - Really nice and hoppy up front, but not in a very distinct way - sweet, fruity, a little piney. The hops are blending very nicely with the mild roasty coffee and cocoa notes in the background.    Taste - Follows the nose very closely. Pretty big hop burst up front... Very IPA-like with plenty of sweet, juicy fruit (even a bit tropical in nature), citrus, a little piney and grassy. Hops balance well and provide some light bitterness and dryness. On the back end the stout complexities come into play with roasty malts, a bit of char, dark fruits, plenty of earthy coffee and cocoa suggestions. Booze is very well hidden. Finishes off-dry with some moderate resin hop bitterness. The hops and dark malts definitely play nice together.    Feel - Ample carb is super smooth and creamy, which suits the full body perfectly. Feels thick and rich, but not heavy. Drinkability is high for the style.    Overall - Pretty killer stout here... Or is it an IPA? It's definitely hopped up to IPA levels. Stout IPA? This bad boy has more in common with a black IPA (imperial black IPA) than an imperial stout. Many times the "black IPA", hoppy/roasty concept clashes horribly... Not this time. No matter how you classify this beer, it's truly excellent on all levels and in every category. That being said, if you don't like the idea of a hoppy stout, you'll probably want to skip this one.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A- pours slick, oily black. Impenetrably dark, very faint ruby around the edges. Half of a finger of tan head forms and disperses quickly. Lacing follows, but slowly leeches into the stout.    S- roasted malts, notes of vanilla sweetness, citrusy hops.    T- dueling tastes of deeply roasted malt and spicy hops. Malt sweetness compliments the tangy hop character. Some vanilla notes throughout the malt sweetness. Hop forward stout. Spicy hops linger through the finish. The beer improves as it warms; the hops mellow slowly as the sweetness asserts itself more.    M- sharp carbonation, thick and oily feel. Well balanced.    O- excellent beer, exemplifies the style - giant malty backbone with aggressive hop character.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a heavy, deep, dark brown in a well lit room. Damn near black. Head is khaki in color and slow to form. Tops out at about a finger's width and disappeared altogether after about 3 sips. Low carbonation. Decent aroma of dark fruit, roasted malt, baked nuts, chocolate, coffee, and maybe some cinammon. The initial taste introduces strong hints of chocolate, hops, and roasted malt. There's a hevy presene of chocolate and baking spices, along with notes of light tropical fruit. Has a decently smooth finish. Aftertaste put me in mind of black coffee (slightly bitter but also sweet).     This beer has a moderate alcohol taste, as well as an overly-hoppy profile for an imperial stout. It's a good beer, just a bit different from the norm. As has been stated in other review, more of a Black IPA.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 Poured into a Duvel snifter glass.    A - 4.50 - Pours jet black with a decent head potential, forms a finger of medium tan colored head. Low head retention, dissipates quickly. Spotty lacing left on the glass.  S - 4.50 - Malts, dark chocolate, currants, black strap molasses and a touch of coffee.   T - 3.25 - Too much hop profile, needs to be aged out. Medium sweet malt, chocolate and currant upfront which is pleasant, but quickly fades into a black IPA reminiscent hoppy bitterness that lingers for quite a long time on the palate and in my opinion, quite frankly has no place in an imperial stout. Really takes away from the experience for me.   F - 4.25 - Good mouthfeel. Decently thick.  O - 3.75 - Fresh, this thing drinks more like an triple imperial black IPA than an imperial stout. It has the qualities of a stout upfront, but sadly the hoppy finish really takes over. I feel this one needs a lot of time to age out that hop profile and may be revisiting this review a year or two down the road from now.

A taste of citrus rind before the chocolate and coffee of the dark malts crush the palate. Then, deep pine resin and molasses sweetness. Lingering bitterness and dark malt astringency.    M - A medium-tick mouthfeel with mild carbonation.    O - Drinks nor like an imperial black IPA, but still a solid dark beer. Was my introduction to imperial stouts and remains a great beer nearly a decade later.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Sight: Black, with some black highlights, and the negative space colored in with an extra black Sharpie. Originally capped with a medium-blend coffee roast colored head, which subsides down to a thing and sustained ring around the top. Lacing is small bands around the wall of my snifter.    Aroma: Roasted espresso beans, bright hops, a whiff of booze. It’s a great combination, like a Wilson to Walters pass, with protection by Malcolm Smith and Bruce Irvin.    Taste: Throughout the entire oral experience, I taste the hops. Espresso notes from the malt play along, and it ends with some heat and more hops. I saw somewhere this was originally meant to be a dark IPA (or I like to call them Cascadian Dark Ales). I completely understand, but because of the espresso qualities of the malt roast, and the abv, I can see why they settled Imperial Stout.    Feel: Medium body, tiny bubbles. A touch filmy or oily, which is fine. I want a little coating with my stouts.    Overall: Like their other boozy offering I tried recently (Dirtwolf- seriously, what took me so long to try that?) I think it’s a well-made beer... great for a nasty February day in NWNJ. Keep it up, Victory.

look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 (from the label) Enjoy By: 10 JUL 2019 C442 P     Appearance: Black body with a narrow foamy light tan head. Fades quickly to a ring.    Aroma: It has an oak barrel aroma and some strong caramel scents. The bottle doesn't say anything about barrel aging but it has that woody smell. There is a bit of pine in there too. All of this is very subtle, but if you take the time it will really come through.    Taste: Interesting. It has a very strong pine and mint quality, backed by this acrid smokey charcoal flavor. It's a lot like what camping in the woods would taste like. It probably sounds funny but that's what it is to me.    Mouthfeel: It has this sharp bite that kicks you in the pants. It can be pretty harsh if that's not what you're looking for in a stout. It's the type of beer you'd want to drink with some sort of snack to cleanse the palate. Nobody would ever say this beer is boring.    Overall: It was a beer that was worth trying. It had a strong presence that really does define what I'd expect from an American Stout. Lots of flavor and palate-shocking presence that makes it worth drinking. If there was an eagle perched in the forest somewhere with a crown on and a beer in his claws, this would be it.

Taste: The taste is very similar to the nose, with some chocolate, coffee and fruity flavors - the hops are pretty forward in this one. There is a bit of alcohol on the back end as well, but not overpowering, pretty subtle.  Mouthfeel: I thought the mouthfeel on this one was a bit thin, and somewhat dry on the finish.  Overall: This is a very good brew, pretty hoppy for an impy stout, but definitely not in a bad way. I really like the hoppiness in that it doesn't overcome the roasty stout flavors, but complements them very well.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 2012 vintage 12 oz bottle, poured into a goblet.    Appearance: Pours a beautiful, completely opaque, pitch-black color with a quarter of a finger of caramel-colored head that quickly dissolved into an extremely thin lacing of foam that partially covered the top of the beer.    Aroma: I’m stuffed up at the moment (I know that being in that condition is not ideal for reviewing a beer) but even so, I can still smell very strong aromas of roasted malt, some subtle smoke, and dark chocolate.    Taste: Strong flavors of roasted malt up front, imparting notes of roasted coffee beans, followed by some subtle smoke, some brown sugar-like sweetness, finished with some well-balanced hops. Delicious!!    Mouthfeel: Chewy and pretty smooth, as there is some slight carbonation. With an ABV of 9.1%, there’s quite a bit of alcohol on the palate, imparting some very pleasant warmth.    Overall: Damn, this is another excellent imperial stout! It has great flavors of roasted malt, sweetness and balanced hops. While not exactly world class like Bell’s Kalamazoo Stout, Founders Imperial Stout, Great Lakes Black-Out Stout and Oskar Blues Ten Fidy, it’s almost up there, and I’ll certainly keep some of this in my cellar! Excellent!

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5 12 ounce bottle into snifter, best before 12/11/2017. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, toast, dark bread, citrus zest, pine, floral, grass, light smoke/char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and moderate citrus/pine hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, toast, dark bread, citrus zest, pine, floral, grass, light smoke/char and floral/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, toast, dark bread, citrus, pine, light smoke/char, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and moderate citrus/pine hop flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Russian imperial stout style. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted malt and moderate citrus/pine hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Black color with a thin tan head that fades and leaves minimal spotty lacing. Espresso, roared malt, citrus, and charcoal. It's roasty up front, espresso, char and burnt toffee flavors up front. Citrus hop bite mid palate finishes too bitter with an astringent burnt coffee flavor and strong hop finish. Feel is medium and a bit thin for a stout. Nicely carbonated and a dry finish. Overall it's dedent, it drinks more like a black IPA, but it's far from the best no matter which way you classify it. Probably will finish the 4 pack but won't seek it out again.

Pours jet black with slight browning at the edges of the pour, with a khaki head. Aroma and flavors are much better now than they were when I had this beer on tap (it was too hot, too hoppy, and needlessly complicated in its flavor profile rather than complex). It's smoother, with lots of chocolate, roasted meat flavors, and complimented by an earthy bleu cheese funk that I am quite enjoying. Mouthfeel is still a little over carbonated for my liking.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 There was no date on the bottle, so I’m not exactly sure how old this is, but I’m pretty sure I’ve aged it at LEAST a few years, which may be why I like this more than others.    Appearance – A super dark black amber with a moderate head and moderate lacing. The head diminishes to a thin layer fairly quickly.    Smell – Wow, a very robust, super malty scent. I’m not smelling the hops that others noticed, likely because of the aging. Semi-sweet chocolate as well.     Taste – A wonderful malty flavor. Again, not much hop flavor, but that’s a big plus in my opinion for a stout.    Mouthfeel – Thick, creamy, nicely carbonated and smooth. No bad aftertaste. I think it could use a little more alcohol, maybe 12-14%, but it’s really nice.    Drinkability – This one surprised me based on the current BA score. Perhaps aging did it wonders.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.75 I was totally shocked from the flavors going on here. A nice dark roast grabs your taste budds and all of a sudden a mild level of hops come into play. The flavors all blended well and made it quite enjoyable.

Bitterness from this hoppy stout really overrode any other traditional flavors that one gets from an imperial. Good to try, but not a taste profile for me.

It's a little strong for my taste, but you can tell it's quality brewed and Victory knows their stuff. I'd try it again in hopes that I can handle it, but maybe that's why I shouldn't have had it in the first place.   
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Poured into a snifter from a 12 oz bottle.    Color is black and opaque with a nice thick tan head. Really nice lacing for a stout. Smell is really interesting. Lots of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate with some underlying sweetness, booze and citric hops. Flavor is strong hops on the palate - bitter chocolate and coffee - followed by some roasted malt flavor and finishing with a strong hop bite. Finish is quite bitter and lingering for a stout. Body is medium/full with a bite from the carbonation and alcohol, lots of sticky hop resins.    Overall, if you like IPAs you'll like this stout. More like a black IPA with some stout character. I like it, but IPA is my favorite style.

Here in Michigan we have many world class imperial stouts, and storm king seems to fly under the radar on our shelves. I decided to pick it up finally, and I could not have been more surprised. Not complex at all. Straight forward, simple, tasty, RIS. The only thing I could ask to be improved is the aroma.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Beer is looking sexy as hell in this goblet. poured really nice jet black with a creamy light brown head...1/2 inch about. As you drink it leaves moderate spotty lacing too.    The smell is very interesting....has all the characteristics of a stout while also hinting that it could be a black IPA type style as well because of all the earthy and floral/grapefruit hops kind of pushing through...dominant smell are dark fruits...espresso..coffee..bitter dark chocolate....lets taste the storm king.     damn this is good!!!...for an imperial stout this is dangerously smooth for a 9.1 abv...i mean DANGEROUS haha. you get those big chocolate and coffee flavors....but coming into play is a mild floral hop presence, kind of bringing all of the flavors together; this beer is super solid.     has a very creamy like mouth feel and is pretty well carbonated.....    All in all if you're into stouts.... but "imperial" stouts tend to scare you away because you're afraid of it being a "booze bomb" or too overwhelming...do not fear this brew...this is a killer beer...big stouty notes.....hop notes evening the strong coffee and chocolate flavors out..and drinks real smooth. if you see this and haven't had it....give this a try...and if you're an IPA hop -head like myself, I really think you will appreciate this beer for what it is.

Maybe I shouldn't fault this beer because I didn't drink it fresh but it was not great at all. The alcohol was very pungent in the nose as it was in the taste. The only thing I enjoyed about this beer was the burnt espresso char that was evident upon the first few sips. This reminded more of a porter was I am splitting hairs there.    Overall I should try it fresh. To give it a fair chance but I can't recommend this to imperial stout fans.

Coal black color, with a decent beige-brown head.     Coffee bean defined nose, with sweeter malts and hints of floral hops.     Tastes of chocolate, followed by coffee and metallic hints, due to a surprisingly high carbonation, which reveals tobacco and earth in the finish. Smooth, slightly fizzy, creamy mouthfeel, medium-bodied beer. Taste converts from warm chocolate notes to a bitter, slightly aggressive coffee bitterness with bitter, floral hops. A bready malt-backbone adds complexity and saves the balance of this beer. The aftertaste is slick coffee bitterness with a hot stinging peak on the tongue and throat, which stays remarkably long. Well balanced, with an intriguing complexity, still pretty straight-forward heading towards the bitterness.

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 It looks great, but it would be appropriate as a Black Ale. This is just way too hoppy. The bitterness from the roasted malt only makes it drink even rougher. It also seems more like an American than a Russian or Imperial Stout. I am going to sit on the other 3 for awhile to see if it helps. Pretty average at best.
