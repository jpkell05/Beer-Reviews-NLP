Because it is a session, you can relax and enjoy the refreshing rush of fruit and hop flavors and aroma without breaking the bank. A gold standard for any other IPA to compete against.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 All Day IPA is exactly what it claims to be. A perfect low ABV beer that has a ton of hop flavor. Can’t tell you how many festivals and camping trips this beer has been my go too for. Love the 15 pack and availability (especially east coast) will go down as one of my favorite beers of all time.

Not one of my normal, go-to beers but its isnt half bad. mellow hoppiness paired with a relatively low ABV and BOOM: session beer. I wouldnt turn it down if offered again but my own personal preference would be an IP in the 6 to 7% ABV range.

look: 3.75 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 2.75 | overall: 2.75 Poured from the bottle into a Westbrook tulip glass.   Look: I dog the color of this beer. The darker, orange toned hue gives high expectations for a relatively low abv session IPA. Most seem to have a straw like color.  Smell: taking a turn here. The Hop aroma is light but I am picking up something metallic, almost irony... It may be coming from the malts, bit I wouldn't expect this from a bottled IPA.  Taste: definitely picking up a more metallic note from the malts backbone. At first sip, the hops shine and make the beer a refreshing, drinkable offering. The metallic aftertaste lingers for what seems like forever. I wonder if this is the case for the draft offering as well??  Mouthfeel: despite the darker color, it is thin enough to be considered a session IPA.   Overall: I really wanted to like this more than I did. A sessionable IPA that makes a statement is difficult to produce, and unfortunately this one didn't break the code for me.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 From notes 3/25/13: Pours a clear deep honey gold with a faint greenish hue when held to the light. The pour produces 1.5 fingers of frothy, somewhat lasting, white head that leaves splotches, strings and motes of lace. Aroma is pine resin heavy with some grapefruit flesh and pith backed by low caramel malt sweetness. Taste is pine needle tart and bitter resin, grapefruit zest, flesh and pith so heavy that it masks most of the malt. It finishes peppery and bitter transitioning to a simple bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation, watery but lively in the mouth and astringent aftertaste.

look: 4.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 First let me state that my least favorite type of beers are IPAs. That said this is a very drinkable good tasting beer. Not real high in alcohol like most IPAs hence the name.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 This beer grew on me over time, and now I consider it an excellent choice for a session IPA.    Poured from a can into a pint glass. It's a golden-honey color, with minimal haziness. The head is average (something I don't care much about). It also has fairly average carbonation. The mouth feel is light, reminiscent of but not quite an India pale lager (IPL). It tastes crisp and refreshing, with a strong, clean hop presence. There is no heavy or complex malt flavor, in keeping with the session-IPA genre, but there is enough. Occasionally, I sense a subtle "metallic" taste, but I don't know if it's due to the can or a characteristic of the hops.    When I want a lighter, lower-alcohol beer with abundant flavor, this one often hits the spot.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 ** I am rating this beer for what it is - a Session IPA - It is ridiculous that a few people are giving it a horrible score because it tastes like a watered down IPA - by design, it is a SESSION beer - which means lower ABV - which is achieved by less grains/fermentables to water ratio. Which in turn is going to give you less malty/bready flavors. This beer still has a lot of Hop flavor. If people want a full strength IPA - then go buy a full strength IPA. And giving a beer a bad score on every category because you don't like the taste is also ridiculous. This is a near perfect beer in color, clarity, and head. Mouthfeel is pretty much right on for this style, and this beer is quite aromatic. **    Look = crystal clear golden color - loads of foam at first - when the head recedes, bubbles, activity, and a foam ring remain  Smell = nice floral hops with a touch of pine and cattiness. Some sweet malt and caramel come through  Taste = decent hop bitterness - a bite at first then some pine and citrus hop flavors barge in. Some sweetness comes through and there are some decent bready/yeasty/malt flavors before drying out and fading out with a slightly smoky finish  Feel = low end of a medium bodied brew - I expected it to be a bit thinner. Activity died down halfway through the drinking timeline so I gave it a bit lower score.  Overall = a great beer - more flavorful than I expected for a session beer. Great color and aroma. Nice blasts of hops throughout. Very happy with this one and will buy again. Founders' beers finally made it to Colorado so I am grabbing as soon as I see them (grew up in Michigan but moved away before I knew what real beer was).

Clear, medium-golden/faintly amber body, few fingers of white foam on top... Light, crisp, clean, smooth... Crackery malt backbone with some hoppy pine shellac and a bit of dry citrus rind... Moderately bitter, mildly sweet, amply carbonated and really refreshing... I think I killed the 12 oz can in like 5 hearty swigs! Don't know if this is gonna change my world view on session beers, but it might - totally possible to crush a six-pack of this without even trying...

Rather drink that little bit extra alcohol and have more flavor and bite. If wanting something lighter to pack down, I'll stick with Yuengling Lager or Pilsner, Pabst and maybe some Narragansett Lager. Likely won't buy this one again.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 24oz can poured into Duvel tulip. CANNED ON: 08 22 18 printed on bottom of can, so it's exactly 2 months old. Should be plenty fresh. Picked it up at a gas station for $1.99.     Appearance - Pours very large, very loose white head with no lacing and decent retention. Absolute tons of carbonation. Maybe the most I've ever seen in any beer. Deep gold body, hazy to the point of opacity. 4.5    Smell - Fresh grass. Citrus rind. Medium to heavy bodied and round. 4.5    Taste - Light, loose grass up front that mellows out into even lighter grass. Slight bitterness in the aftertaste. 4.5    Mouthfeel - Light-medium bodied, more toward the light end. 4.5    Overall - No off characters. Packs enough grassy bite up front to be a worthwhile IPA, but mild enough to be a great session beer. I fully understand how this beer got its name 'All Day IPA'. Literally even says 'Session Ale' on the can. Flavorful but mild and drinkable. Well done. Great price too. 4.5

A fantastic Session IPA with an OG hop profile. More of the grapefruit, pine, floral notes of IPAs of old. Excellent stuff.

If I'm looking for a Session IPA where cost is not a consideration, firestone easy jack IPA and Terrapins session offering would be higher on my list. Still, for about a buck a can, this is an easy go to Session IPA that gives you enough hops to almost make you forget that it is a bit monochromatic. Certainly worth a try for anyone who likes hops and not too much alcohol.

This is my fave so far with its smooth but definitely hoppy taste and aroma. In a case of cans, I’m unable to see it but imagine it looks as clean and shiny as it tastes. Very nice!   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.25 Not a terribly exciting beer. I'm a big fan of IPA's, but not session beers. This is better than most, but very one dimensional. Hops without much of a malt backbone to balance things out. Just hop bitterness with a fairly thin mouthfeel. It does have its place though if you don't feel like getting hammered after several beers, but I'd take Firestone Easy Jack over this one.

Canned on 05/17/17 so it lasts well. I t still seems fresh. From a 19.2 ounce can into a nonic glass.

The beer is a light copper, burnt orange hue under a cream colored head that retains well — layer of froth on top with light lacing. Aroma is light pine and a subtle grassiness. The beer tastes the same with very light astringent pine with buttery malts which finishes bitter. Mouthfeel is light but sticky.    Overall, not my thing. I’ll probably never drink a session ipa again, as hyped as this one was.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 19.2 oz Can.   Pours a nice hazy gold color. Foam dissipates quickly leaving a bit but not much lacing.   Lots of IPA's have a grapefruit-like quality, but the aroma on this beer is exactly the same as cutting open a fresh juicy grapefruit. Perhaps a note of tropical fruit and alcohol but faint. Moderately carbonated.    Taste is excellent. Flavors of fresh mango, orange, pine, wheat. It is arranged in a way that the hops are not overbearing but still very apparent. Certainly not bitter, great entry to hop-present beer for someone interested in trying an IPA. Light body (but not watery) and drinkable (That's why it's called Session Ale). Like the image on the bottle, great beer for a hiking or fishing trip. Not an IPA i would turn to for rich flavor after a meal but it serves it's purpose, and is among the best tasting at this ABV.  Overall grade is A-

Has a touch of citrus in the flavor and a subtle zestyness to the aftertaste. Finishes crisp, with a lingering, slight, piney bitterness.    It's light on the palate, but not watery. Very well carbonated.     This is the perfect beer to drink when you're craving that IPA complexity but need to pace yourself (hence the sub-style name). So far this is my favorite session IPA!

The classic IPA aroma. It smells really good right now, though. Grapefruit juice as well as peel and zest and oils. Pine needle, orange peel, and light bready, toasty malt.    T: Big pink grapefruit juice, flesh, pith, and peel, all in perfect harmony. Big essence of grapefruit--sweet, sour, and bitter all at once. Lightly toasty, bready malt in the middle with hints of caramel and honey. A touch of orange and mango as well. Nice sticky pine on the back end, slightly resinous and vibrant. Finishes crisp, with a slight lingering stickiness of resin and a light piney bitterness.    F: Light, but not watery. Very well carbonated. Finishes fairly crisp and clean save a sticky hop resin that coats the palate.    O: I can't believe I haven't reviewed this earlier. This beer is the progenitor of the session IPA substyle, and still one of the best. A really great beer on its merits.

look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 19.2 oz can poured into a pint glass.     L - Pours a hazy amber/copper color with a bit of transparency and a generous inch or so of soapy white foam that leaves a good lacing throughout. Looks like a lighter IPA.     S - Piney hops, citrus rind, resin, grass, cereal grain, a slight sweetness to it but the typical piney IPA is dominant.     T - Lemon, orange, grapefruit, a little bit of malt and hops, some spice, astringent alcohol bite to finish. Nothing overpowers or stands out, so it's pretty balanced.     F - Light and crisp, definitely drinkable for an all-day session, so it fits the name. Decent carbonation but not too bubbly. Finishes slightly dry but refreshing. It's like an IPA that drinks almost like a lager.    O - A nice, lighter offering for those summer days when you want to knock back a few but not feel knocked out. Has a nice balance of bittersweet and sour from the hops and citrus with just a touch of malty sweetness. If you're looking to break into IPAs, this is a good starter option. And hey, this is my 100th beer review, so cheers to that.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Pours a nice golden color, thin head, light lacing. Muted aroma but not out of the ordinary for a session IPA. It has a well-balanced flavor, a good piney flavor with a hint of citrus without one ingredient overpowering the other but still nothing really popping out. It has a good feel, somewhat light and crispy without being overbearing, on the palate. With the low ABV, I can see this being a good all-day beer, though it is a bit bland for me, but not bad at all.

look: 2.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 2.5 So my rating is due to being in the Pacific Northwest for 5 years. This beer just does not compare to the IPA's I have enjoyed in the PNW. The overall badly is light, strong piney, and the finish is shallow. It has a moment but it is short lived. Bought this in a can at Whole Foods in Ausrin TX. I alwYs Che k BA but this one did not live up to the ratings.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Pours a slightly hazy honey color. Lots of carbonation rising to the top. Head is one finger and off-white. Retention is decent.    Piney hops in the nose. Citrus peels are noticeable. Malts are there to balance it out. No lingering bitterness.    Malty with some nice piney hops to keep it in check. Nothing complex. Just a well balanced IPA,    Light and easy on the carbonation. All Day IPA is a fitting name.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 Canned on 1/24/2018. Poured from the can into a pint glass. The beer pours a yellow/orange with a two-finger head. The smell is hops, grapefruit and a little pine. The taste is a bold IPA flavor, you wouldn’t think this is a session IPA if the can and abv didn’t say so. The texture is great, not too heavy but not to light. Overall this is a good sipper if you don’t want to drink a 7% IPA at noon and still want to be productive throughout the day. The can doesn’t lie this is an excellent “All Day IPA”.

Nice golden color with moderate white foamy head, some mild lingering lacing. Smells of nice hops, more floral than citrus. Tastes of floral hoppiness, some nice bright fruit, malt and biscuit. Very little bitterness. Thin mouthfeel, perfect amount of moderate carbonation throughout. A great, rock-solid beer.

Taste was the same, citrus.pine hops over soft malt.    The body was light, had good carbonation, and a semi-dry finish.    Drinkability was fine, no issues, except for the idiotic can size. Overall, solid enough. It's no Field 41, but it's enjoyable enough. worth trying if you see it.

Pours a clear medium amber with half a finger of dirty white head that leaves Alpine cliffside lace as it recedes.    Smells of lime peel, lemon zest, crisp caramel malt and freshly cut lawn.    Tastes of white bread crust, mixed citrus rind, mild caramel and more grassy, piney hops.    Feels bright and clean. Lean medium bodied with peppy carbonation. Finishes dry.    Verdict: Recommended. A nice little beer that is easy to drink and tastes good.

Smells of melon, tangerine, orange, essentially a lot of citrusy hops, along with pine.    Tastes much like the aroma. Grapefruit, orange, and tangerine up front, along with a grassy, pine supplement. Has melon, pineapple, and slight lemon peel in the back. Feels smooth.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 One of the best budget ipas in my opinion. Nice hop forward smooth finish, keeps you thirsty for more.

Like not crushing 10+ beers before 4pm at a kegger but more like relaxing at the beach having a few nice canned ipas over the course of a few hours while still being able to play a game of beach vollyball. Aka sessionable. And ya for the price its tough to beat.

Healthy hop nose with some pine    Big hop flavor up front with some pine and nutty notes, pretty thin in terms of malty flavor as expected for the style. Thin into the finish, but with some nice subtle hop bitterness.     Light body, medium carbonation. No astringency or harshness. Fairly thin and gentle on the tongue.    In the upper tier of session IPAs that I've tried. Slightly thin, but nice hop character.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Canned 1/16/18, consumed 4/1/18    Got a cold 19.2oz. can at the A's vs. Angels game at O.co Coliseum.    Drank it out of the can at the ballpark, I want to put N/A for Look but that's not an option.    Aroma and taste were both perfect for a session IPA, not as pungent and dank as regular IPAs but definitely not light or watered down in any way.     Mouthfeel was light and easy, all day is the perfect name and description for the way these go down.     Overall, I'm going to be adding this to my list of session beers around 5%ABV to pick up. Perfect ballpark beer - so glad they had this as an alternative to all the lagers and blonde ales.

It smells good, but that almost perfume like smell is definitely too present in the taste. Founders has some good brew, this just wasn't one for me.

F: Light body, light carbonation, kick of bitterness in the finish, decent mouth coating. But ultimately still a little thin.  O: A decent low ABV AIPA but the mouthfeel suffers as usual. Proof again that it’s almost always better to drink a genuine low ABV style, like an English pale ale, than a low ABV version of a high ABV style.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 19.2 oz can, dated 10/24/17.    Clear amber with a big, creamy white head that leaves behind patchy lacing on the glass.    Aroma is a classic mix of pine, grapefruit, and orange citrus. Faint sweet pale malt too, if you really search for it. Flavor is citrus and tropical fruit, with bitterness from the hops. Not much else going on other than that.    Body is medium-light and it's refreshing and easy to drink. It teeters on the edge of becoming too thin, but there's just enough body there to keep you interested.     Admittedly, the session IPA is not my favorite style. But this is likely the best one I've had. Most just taste like hop water and lack character but this is more akin to a pale ale than session IPA.

Clear copper-colored body, with two fingers of off-white head that left a modicum of sticky lacing as it settled. Even at two months past the bottling date, there was lots of hop character. Big aromas and flavors of pine, orange, and citrus zest, balanced by a light caramel malt presence. Light to medium mouthfeel, crisp finish, and a bit of resin and citrus zest lingering on the palate. Light and refreshing. this one delivers.

Upon cracking the can, the air is filled with the smell of lemongrass and citrus. A wiff of the glass reveals hints of melon and pine.  A decent malt profile takes a backseat in this hop - forward sessional. Flavors of citrus and lemongrass rush in with a touch of chamomile. Then, juicy notes of melon sweep over, immediately followed by a classic resinous pine and a lingering bitterness.  Perfectly carbonated per style; this brew has a smooth, almost silky finish with a refreshing but not-too-thin body. This is a fantastic example of a session IPA; it definitely showcases some classic and delicious hop character.

The look - golden. A little sticky, with a decent retention. I'm surprised. The smell on this one is nice, how could anyone complain? Have you seen the alternatives people?!?! Smell is of pine, hop resin, and just general dankness. Had I not known better, this would be a lot more expensive of a beer. In fact, lots of fools try to pass off beers as being "great" when they are no more fresh or better than this one. The flavor is also great, matching the hops, just a little light on the bitterness. The feel shows that it is a session ale - super light. I guess that's why people don't rate this higher or something? Maybe I just got a really fresh can, but I would say that this is a perfect introduction for someone to an IPA without all the barriers that might stop your everyday Natty Lite type drinker. I've drank a lot of beers and this one is not bad at all. There is a little bit of barley/grain that kind of seems to sit in the finish, but this beer is supposed to be a session ale, and it does what it does like a boss. Cheers.

Fairly light feel, slightly sticky. Tastes of citrus, hop resin, and a touch of malt. I still prefer stronger IPAs, but this is decent and at $15 for a 15-pack, the price is right.

I usually don't buy session IPAs because it seems like a scam, less alcohol and more water for the same amount of money. But I saw a 15 pack of Founder's All Day session IPA cans when stocking up for hurricane Irma on sale, so I bought it. It was delicious! Very light, refreshing, decently carbonated, almost bitter enough, and not too much aftertaste, fairly dry and clean. Easy to drink, and very convenient for long days of drinking... not much alcohol in them, a bit hard on the wallet, but a lot of fun.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 Pours a very lightly cloudy amber with tall active head; subsides rather quickly, leaves moderate lacing. Some active carbonation visible throughout. Aroma is mostly of malt; not a good sign for an IPA, even a session; some very mild citrus / tangelo aroma. Taste follows with not much going on in the hop department; acidity from the carbonation is too pronounced up front with too little hops to drown it out. Some light taste of citrus, but it's mostly just the rather bland malt flavours that dominate. Even maybe a hint of adjunct-like flavour poking its way through at the end of each sip. Mouthfeel is neither full nor even close to juicy. Somewhat watery as I find most session IPAs are, sadly. Disappointing for Founders, even though I wasn't expecting much given that it's a 4.7% session. If you want to try a session that keeps all the flavour of a good IPA with a low ABV, you've got to try Maine Beer Company's "Post Ride Snack". It's the only session IPA with which I've been pleasantly surprised instead of disappointed.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Appearance: Slightly cloudy medium golden body is crowned by a massive, dense white head, which subsides only slowly. Rings of patchy broken lace adorn the glass walls. Sparse, fat bubbles drift lazily to the surface.    Aroma: Strong aroma of grapefruit rind and pine tar, these utterly dominate, though there is a quite pleasing note of pale malt, though subdued.    Taste: Begins with a strong surge of grapefruit rind, soon followed by prominent, but lesser pine tar flavors. As the taste progresses, the pale malt present as a slight bread presence. The taste draws to a close with a modest surge of piney hops.    Mouth feel: Soft, pleasant, and full, with a modest note of carbonation.    Drinkability/notes: A very nice choice for a warm summer day, a pleasing alternative to mass-produced pale lagers.    Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce aluminum can, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice.

Slightly hazy with modest visible carbonation. Lacing was better than expected, but not super. Retention was fair.    S: citrusy, resiny, floral hops. Very straight-up IPA smell; slight sweetness, just a hint.    T: immediately hoppy, resinous, floral arrival. Crisp, lightly bready middle rounds out to a grapefruit peel center that transitions across the ending and lasts through the finish.    M: lighter end of medium. Moderate carbonation.    O: I've had this three or four times, usually toward the end of the night at a party, and thought I liked it, but couldn't be sure. Well, confirmed, this is a great beer and I can see why it sells like hot cakes. It has more body than any session IPA I've had yet. The hops are standard IPA fare, none of these newfangled varieties that taste like crap after a month. Overall, this is just a pretty standard IPA in every respect but one - it has less than 5% ABV, and getting that to happen is a feat of artistry.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Poured into a small chalice: color is gold, transparent, solid small bubbled head that presents at least 1/2 inch thick; head dissipates to light outer ring.     Smell is light toast, some hop presence, mainly grassy/floral hops.    Taste is just a straightforward easy drinking slightly hoppy beer, still find it odd these are considered 'ipas' and not just hopped up pale ales, but regardless the construction is well done and flavors are pleasant. Malt is light, maybe some toast, not emphatic or dramatic; hops are earthy, grass, herbal, hint of citrus rind.     Mouthfee is moderate, fairly strong dry/bitter quality which works at higher strengths with some more malt, but seems distracting on a lighter ale.     Overall, good beer, but nothing to separate from just a well constructed hoppy, pale ale.

A decent go-to beer that you can find in a can or bottle at most any dive bar. Founder's mimicked the Sam Adams formula and produced a beer that's slightly better.

Flavor reverses this with strong pine up front, with tropical fruit and sweet malt finish.     A nice dryness that can be hard to achieve in this style without totally losing body.

There are lots of good sessionable craft ales out now that are decently priced (including this one, Dayblazer, and 12th of Never)- it's a good summer to be a beer drinker! This one is a piney yet grainy fizzer. A worthy foamer to take to the dome. (I would likely take 12th of Never in a pinch, though.)    I've housed quite a few of these on any given 2017 summer night! CHEERS!

Light in body as intended, but with more oomph than most sessions. Finish is bitter. Well carbonated.

Toasted malts and some fruitiness, but not as much as the aroma, touch of pineapple, dry finish and the hops kick in at the perfect level, mildly pithy; light-medium body , good carbonation.  Overall it has amazing balance, and is interesting without being TOO interesting - could definitely drink this one all day.

The aromas of this session IPA are rich in hoppy notes, especially of florals and fruits, all nicely balanced and distinct. Taste is less distinct, there are some floral, grass, pine and citrus notes, but seem a bit watered down and indistinct, except for a light bitter sweetness. The finish is medium, and it ends with a bit of a watery texture and note, although the average level of carbonation does make it smooth for most part. Net, great aromas, but a bit indistinct on he taste.

S: Citrusy hops, slightly less smell than characteristic of most IPAs    T: Alcohol virtually absent except very slightly on the finish. Pine trees, slight citrus, balanced hops, slight bitterness closer to finish. Love that this does not have a bitter aftertaste at all. Makes me want to go for another sip. Slightly pine-like aftertaste which I like.    F: Decent mouthfeel. Carbonation feels slightly strange for some reason, but no complaints for the most part.    O: This has certainly grown on me. Sorta feels like drinking a tree if that makes sense. Good to have in the fridge. Makes you want to go back to it, but probably not something I'd drink super regularly. Won't get you hammered at a relatively low 4.7% for IPAs (perhaps thus the name --"All Day" haha.

Poured into a large Boston Lager glass, this was a slightly chill hazed, coppery shade of amber, with a big, creamy,beige head. Lots of lace.    Grapefruity and piney hop aroma to this, with a malt presence I've come to expect from a midwest IPA.    Taste is like the nose, but the malts are a little closer to the hops. It's a little low on the hop flavor that I picked up in the nose, but still packs pretty good flavor for something 4.7% alcohol.    A little low in carbonation, with a body a little thicker than I expected for a session IPA.    For what I paid for this, it's a steal in its ubertallboy can. It's not bad for a session IPA, but there's two locally brewed examples I'd rank ahead of it. They don't come in an awesome can like this, however, so this could see some use on outdoor occasions this summer.

But in all seriousness, this beer is meant to replace shit beer like bud light and corona. It's a refreshing, toned down session IPA that isn't meant to be a heavy hitter. Decent.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 Founders All Day is an encouraging campaign for long afternoon cracklings with your mates but unfortunately falls flat to other session options. Luring me in with a sexy amber color and light head this brew makes further promises a strong fragrant head. Upfront you are hit with floral and citrus wafts on the nose with slight pine forest background. Unfortunately this is a style over substance problem as the sexy aroma and looks give way to overly aggressive hops which while encouragingly dry are muddled in their punch to the pallet. As you finish off a quaff the palate is left with a chalkly mineral dischord. Lots of lead up to a disappointing end. Not a bad beer overall but strictly middle of the road in terms of overall flavor. Body is a couple notches south of medium and finishes light on the tum making extended drinking feasible if you are buzzed enough to forgive the lack of finesse on the tastebuds buds.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 $ 10/six pack of 12 oz bottles ($ 0.139/oz) at Oppermann’s, Saginaw, MI.  Bottled 2/15/17. Stored at 42 degrees and served at 42 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.  Aroma – citrus predominates with piney undertones.  Head – average (Maximum 3.5 cm, aggressive pour), off white, medium density, average duration, diminishing to a dense irregular five to ten mm ring and rocky partial layer fed by effervescence.  Lacing – excellent. Complete rings of tiny bubbles featuring stalactites and columns connecting the next ring.  Body medium yellow, almost clear (chill haze), effervescent.  Flavor odd. Definitely a citrus slant but a little chalk. Possibly a citrus fruit with which I’m not familiar. Not unpleasant. Some malt. No alcohol, no diacetyl.  Palate – light to medium, watery, lively carbonation.    One of the poorer offerings from Founders, IMHO. Perhaps Oppermann’s propensity to store large quantities of beer at room temperature has something to do with it. The chalky aftertaste makes this a case of one six pack and done.    Appearance 4.25, Aroma 4, Flavor 3, Palate 4, Overall 3.5.

However plenty of bubbles remain so looks like an average session ale, I give it a 4  The smell, loads of citrus and pine, but at a lighter level than say a double IPA. There's plenty to take in here and I'm lovin it. 4.5  Taste is equal to the smell. This is by no means a heavily flavored brew, but bygosh there's lots of different notes. There's a rich citrus quality, more on the lemon side. Also there is some pine, reminding me of when I've gone camping. Theres a decent malty backbone to it, but it is lighter than usual, and the flavor slips away quickly and doesn't linger. This is a very flavorful beer for 4.7%. I give it a 4.25  The mouthfeel is slightly watery but still tastes like a good beer, not much to say here so 4  Overall I like this beer as a session ale but its not what you are looking for if you want full flavor. 4.25

A good session blend of hops w/o slapping your taste buds excessively with pine needles, as well as very crisp and refreshing. Not filling at all and goes well with food. Also it’s only 147 cal a can so practically lite beer for people who actually love beer.

Some stringy lace.  The aroma had a nice sweet grassy hop contour flowing over some light floral and steadying a slight malt base soaking in the hops.  The flavor was fully bittersweet bringing the hops to the malts and carrying a beautiful blend of it all into the aftertaste and finish.  The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with a nice sessionability about it. Carbonation felt good. ABV felt appropriate.  Overall, pretty nice IPA that I could have again, makes for a great session while fishing.

Medium intensity and well-balanced. Prominent hops with resinous, earthy, and citrusy notes of pine, cut grass, and pineapple. There's a honey-like malt backbone to support all that hoppiness. No esters and no alcohol.    Taste: Very much like the aroma. High hop flavour with citrusy lemon, resinous pine, cut grass, and pineapple. Low yet strong enough malt profile to make this a balanced brew. The finish is medium-dry and well-balanced.    Feel: Medium body with lively carbonation. Creamy, fizzy, and slightly drying. No apparent alcohol warmth.    Overall: All in all this a very good beer with no apparent flaws. Great flavour and very drinkable. An epitome to what an all day IPA should be. I'd have it again given the chance.

Smells of clean bright pine resin and a touch of creamy wheat and steel. Taste is bright green grass and a slight herbal oregano. Tasty, juicy, floral and smooth. Tons of fresh hop flavor without the big bite on the finish. Slightly thin on the texture, but that makes it very refreshing and clean. Slight dry finish but crisp and tangy. Love that this comes in a 19.2oz can.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 This one impresses me more and more. Due to its easy (for me) availability in cans and the 4.7% ABV it has become a go to boat beer for me this summer. It has plenty of flavor for a session beer.  I recently started my afternoon with two DFH 60 Minute IPAs and had only All Day IPA cans immediately available to me, to my surprise the All Days held up very well.

Light gold in color with a slightly less than pure white head that provides some clinging side glass lace that has average retention.  SMELL: Hops and lots of grapefruit and citrus. Pine hops.  TASTE: Not as tart as I expected. Grapefruit prominent but not overwhelming (as feared). Some drying resin hops  With each sip, my taste buds adjusted to the early smack of grapefruit and this beer became more enjoyable.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Tried this beer in 19.2 OZ cans. A great IPA to enjoy-- not too heavy in hops, yet the hops are the main ingredient in this beer that stands out. Alcohol content is 4.7%, which makes this a great beer to enjoy in the summer time, or as a session IPA.   
look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Look: Pours a slightly hazy light orange/yellow color with a HUGE three finger frothy head of off white foam. Leaves sticky webs of lacing lining the entire length of the glass.    Aroma: Bright tropical mango, orange, some sweet caramel and a little bit of pine and grapefruit rind.    Taste: Well balanced. Slightly more bitter than sweet. Upfront flavors of mildly dry grapefruit and sweet mango. Finishes on malty notes of toasted carmel and juicy pineapple, with hints of orange candy.    Feel: Thirst quenching. Crisp. Mid-light body. Low carbonation. Very crushable.    Overall: Unbeatable for the price. $10 a 15 pack at Costco. A solid choice to keep around in the fridge during the warmer months. Better in cans in my opinion.    Rating: [B+] Great. 4.00/5   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Look: A shade darker than gold, with a very persistent and surprisingly vigorous head.     Smell: Grapefruit, more like the fruit than the zest, with some pine underlying it.    Taste: Grapefruit juice, with a little graininess and a piney/pithy finish.    Feel: Thin, but not quite watery, a dry, refreshing finish.    Overall: It's a bit thinner than I'd like for a "feature presentation" beer, but for a BBQ outside or a drink after a long day outside in the summer heat, it does a great job. No palate fatigue, but it won't bore you, either. For a 4.7% pale ale (at that gravity it's not an IPA), it's not bad at all.

Hop flavor, citrus and pine, dominate from start to finish and linger in the aftertaste. Malt presence is noted but it really doesn't have springs heavy duty enough to carry the hop load.    Texture is lignt medium balanced with carbonation.    Overall it's a decent example of the new session IPAs, fairly lightweight brew with an overabundant hop load.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 4.25 I picked this up by accident. Thought I was getting Sierra Nevada but didn't realize it was actually Founder's until I got back to my car. It was a 15 pack of cans, which pleasantly surprised me. I like to try new beers on a regular basis, so this was a happy accident.     12 oz can poured into a tulip glass.     L: A rich golden color that reminds me of raw honey. Very little head, but I typically pour with a lighter hand. Very hazy, too.    S: Smells really great. Like fresh grapefruit. There is a good amount of pine, too. Nothing too strong though.     T: Tastes like you took a bite out of a grapefruit. Not a big citrus rind explosion you get from something like Stone or Ballast Point, but actual fruit. Pine notes in the background, more citrus fruit based. A lot lighter than most IPA's I have tried, but not in a bad way. This beer has a lot of good flavors, it is just different from what most IPA's are going for these days.    F: Really light carbonation. I tend to like my beers to have a little more body to it. This is the only problem with this beer. Some may like this, but not me.     Overall, this a solid beer. Glad I got to try it, even if it was by mistake. I would drink it again, but it might be a while before circle around to it again. This might just be something with me, though. I like to try everything I see. This beer is light, crisp and refreshing. Has great notes of actual grapefruit fruit, which is different from other IPA's I have tried recently. I would be happy to drink this again.

Founders did a great job with this one.

There's pale malt in there too, but it mostly shows up as a faintly toasted undertone.    Taste: Very balanced. Nice malt character with citrus hop notes in the front. Finishes with a clean, slightly piney bitterness. Doesn't wallop you with hops in the taste.    Feel: Light bodied and easy to drink.    Overall: Great session beer with all the things I like about more aggressive IPAs.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 BOD 11/23/16 Clear golden pour with a touch of amber. Quite outstanding head volume and lacing, normal retention.    Outstanding, although intensity is a bit modest, nose of light citrus (lemon with a touch of grapefruit and pineapple) over a subtly sweet base. The malt base has both grainy and bready characteristics. As it warms, light notes of floral hops are presented.    The body is, surprisingly, light medium with a smooth texture that has subtle oily aspects. The carbonation / body balance is slightly below normal. Both the middle and finish levels of effervescence are slightly below adequate.    The flavor profile is subdued for an IPA. It lacks intensity and complexity. Granted this is a "session" IPA, but session IPAs are not a separate style and must be judged against the IPA standard. It is however, very well balanced. The bitterness is mild and combines both rind and pine in composition. Hop flavor presents as a combination of weak lemon and orange. The middle is not sweet per se but does balance the low bitterness level. The finish provides a light lingering bitterness. As a pale ale this one would score considerably higher. It is flavorful but as an IPA, this misses the mark and is "watery" - something an IPA should never be.

Bottled January 25, 2017.    Appearance - mostly clear, rich golden coloured beer with an impressive finger and a half of white head. Plenty of spotty lacing all around the glass.    Smell - rich citrus hops flood the nose with some earthy goodness mixed in. Subtle sweetness mixed in for a well balanced pale ale.    Taste - deliciously balanced, with a touch of juicy fruits, steady grain background and a nice kiss of sweetness at the end. Yet sufficient bitterness throughout. A great daily drinker.    Mouthfeel - smooth and light bodied, perfect carbonation and finish.    Overall - while All Day IPA might not be the best beer on the planet, it is one of the easiest drinking and harmonizes the balance between malt and hops, clean finish, light body and general drink ability to such an extent, that I now understand those who say if they had to drink one beer for the rest of their lives, it would be All Day IPA. Very delicious and a must try beer for any lover of any kind of beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 A boring if completely inoffensive American Pale Ale. At least, in the area, Founders has made a huge push with this one - large singles are available in every liquor store, including those too near the capitol to usually sell singles; they obtained permission to be sold as "premiums", meaning that Founders really does seem to be making a concerted effort to get this onto every shelf.     That's more than reflected in the taste - what an inoffensive pale ale. This is the pale ale that I'd want to be the first someone tries. Neither east nor west, citrus and pine both collude to make for a mildly flavorful experience, just complex enough to mask the carbonation taste, but simple enough to where there isn't much to speak of beyond the lemon, maybe a hint of ginger? Maybe not.     The generic pale ale to purchase when you want a pale ale, but crave no particular brand or flavor. Ingenious, if unexciting.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Pours a golden color with a white head that goes away quickly. Can smell hops with a hint of citrus along with some pine. Has a grainy malt taste along with a hop aftertaste.

Lighter bodied and easy drinking.    Decent session hoppy ale. I think Stone's Go-To is still my favorite but it will be nice to have this one in the market year round.

Pours golden copper in color with a small, white head that recedes into a film that lasts throughout the experience. Some lacing clings to the glass as you drink.    Smell is hop forward: Citrus rind, grapefruit, some floral and pine.    Taste follows the nose, featuring citrus, floral, and pine notes. Finishes with a lingering hop bitterness. Malts play a purely supportive role.    Mouth feel is on the lighter side of medium bodied, generously carbonated.    Drinkability is excellent. This is a session ale if there ever was one.    There is a time and place for every beer. All Day IPA is there for you when you want a sessionable high quality brew at a reasonable price.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 12 oz bottle from a six-pack purchased at the LCBO; best before Nov 25 2017 and served well-chilled.    Pours a foggy, translucent golden-blonde hue, generating one finger's worth of soapy white head which requires a minute or two to recede down to a bubbly collar and film. At the same time, a smooth curtain of sticky lace is deposited. Grapefruit, lemon pith and clementine citrus are apparent from the first sniff, alongside some earthy pine needles and floral, leafy hop notes. There's also perhaps a hint of grainy sweetness - but truthfully, the malts lack the oomph needed to punch through the strong current of hoppy goodness which characterizes the aroma. Is that a problem for me? Hell naw; not for this sort of beer.    An appealing, flavourful session ale, with the profile basically adhering to the same specs as the nose. Wheaty, grainy pale malt sweetness is relegated to a purely supportive role, allowing for citrusy grapefruit and lemon rind notes to run roughshod over the taste buds. A slight hint of apricot or melon surfaces mid-sip, but is soon lost amidst the piney, floral bitterness of the back end, which culminates in an earthy finish and slightly resiny aftertaste. Quite light-bodied, with fairly sharp, biting carbonation that is in no way shy about prickling the palate. Exceedingly drinkable for such a sturdily-hopped brew.     Final Grade: 4.2, a solid A-. Founders' All Day IPA is an excellent session ale that I'd buy by the case, if it were sold in that format in this market. While it's not exactly a complex (or even especially memorable) pale ale in terms of hop profile, it's still quite well put-together - particularly for a session IPA, a pseudo-style which I am admittedly not a major proponent of. Certainly better than nearly all of the locally-brewed competitors in this hoppy, crushable sub-style, with only one or maybe two exceptions coming to mind. I'd encourage Ontario BAs to grab a sixer while it's fresh and near its peak.

OK.     Pours clear gold, nice thick head.  Not much to talk about taste wise. Very bland, not much hop bitterness or flavor.  Very light, but not satisfying if you expect any sort of IPA body.    I suppose if you get it cheap enough, and you're at an all-day BBQ, this might be an okay choice. But I'm glad I only bought one.

A little thin lacing    Overall smell is not very prominent.(perhaps because it's 3 months old?) I'm getting mostly lemon citrus with a little malt    Taste is a little bolder then the smell. The hop bite is very slight    Slightly prickly feel    There is a lot to like about this session IPA. It's very drinkable and the price of a 15 pack of cans cost less then some 12 packs of other beers. I bought this single beer to see if I wanted to invest in a 15 pack next week... I think i will!

Saw the new 19.2 oz cans and picked up 5 of them for 1.99 each! 15 pks and now these great tallboys. There's certainly better beers, but it might be the best session ipa. Especially, for the price and convenience of the packaging.

A: Subtle aromas of citrus like grapefruit and lemon, touch of pine, tangerine, solid aroma.    T: Sweet citrus notes upfront, tangerines, lemons, touch of grapefruit and pine bitterness in the middle, finish has lingering notes of grapefruit and pine, some citrus sweetness as well.     M: Light bodied with a good amount of carbonation and a dry finish.    O: This is pretty good, good amount of flavor and aroma, amazingly drinkable.

I know you're supposed to drink beers fresh, but I took a chance. Glad I did...I think a can's life is longer since no light gets in at all. Anyway ...it pours a nice head..looks light orange...medium lacing...smell is not real apparent..taste is mildly bitter...definite hops here..grows on you with each sip. I have become a big fan of Founders brews.   
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Poured to a tulip glass.    A: The body is yellow-y to orange with a good crystalline look although not extreme, since there's a fair amount of haziness in this beer. The head is white, minimal, but showing good retention and minor lacing.  S: The aroma is very citrusy, having tangerine, orange and a bit of pineapple. Closely, there is a big resinous profile.  T: The taste is sweet of ripe tangerines followed by a big resinous profile, ending in mild malt profile.  M: Body is medium to medium low. Carbonation is high however, it's not visible. Alcohol is unnoticeable. Bitterness is high.  O: It's a very fresh and easy to drink IPA. The drinkability is valued on this beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Stovepipe canned on Valentine's day. A nice refreshing beer that is a touch lighter at 4.7%. Decently hoppy / lightly bitter with a nice pine hop note, and very crushable. Recommended, especially at $2 a huge can.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Felt like some hops today, but didn't want to gamble on a full six-pack of something new. Local retailer had single All Day 19.2 oz. cans and I'd never tried it before. Not sure where a Pale Ale stops and a "Session" IPA begins, I'm hoping this is more along the lines of a good APA.    Canned on 01.31.17 - not bad at all. Poured into my imperial nonic.    L -- Clear, deep gold with a firm white head that holds up well.    S -- Strong resiny pine hop aroma, verging on harsh. Some herbal earthiness back. There's a toasty, oaty, cereal grain note in the glass after the beer is gone -- only real malt character I picked up in this beer.    T -- Strong herbal, resin hop flavors up front with some light citrus notes following. Earthy, resin, herbal bitterness in the finish that lingers through the aftertaste. Maybe the lightest hint of biscuit malt in the aftertaste, but not nearly enough to balance the hop juice. The finish is surprisingly clean, other than the lingering resin bitterness at the back of the throat.    F -- Mouthfeel is crisp and dry with a light to medium-light body (no malt, no body).    O -- This is a good beer to quench a hop craving without getting clubbed by the usual IPA ABV. While it's flavorful and goes down pretty easily, I honestly don't think I could drink it "all day." The lingering hop resins in the aftertaste start to fatigue the palate quickly and any hop craving quickly turns to a malt craving! Nonetheless, hop-heads will like this as a good session choice... wonder how it mellows with age...   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Clear golden with two fingers of white head. Some rings and swathes of lace.  Smell is floral hops and light bready malts.  Taste is floral hops with very light malt presence.  Mouthfeel is watery with good carbonation. Finish is dry and mildly bitter.  Overall I dub this an IPA Light. One of the better session IPAs so far.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 This beer pours a, fairly clear, darker golden color. Nice carbonation bubbles in glass when poured, and a 1 1/2 finger head. The nose smells amazing - nice citrus - orange, maybe lemon. The taste is mellow for a second, then the citrus from the hops hit. You can feel the carbonation going down nicely. Refreshing, and fairy easy drinking. A solid IPA.

The aroma is very citrusy, primarily orange with grassy and piney notes being a bit overpowered.  The flavor is citrusy, grassy with a nice dry finish. It is a bit watery, but what else would you expect out of a session IPA.  Overall, I'm glad I tried this. It is sort of a classic, and a great deal at $2 s stovepipe. it's not my favorite, but it's very good for what it is.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 This beer pours a bright golden color that is transparent with the slightest bit of chill haze. Very active carbonation. The head is two fingers, rocky and slightly off white. Retention is solid and there is just a few spots of lacing.    Smell is piney, citrus, herbal and earthy. Citrus flavors including orange and grapefruit are much more noticable when the beer is agitated.    Taste is similar, but kind of muted. All the flavors from the smell are there, but it just seems like there isn't much to it.    Feel is light, smooth and slightly watery. Suprisingly not as crisp as I thought from the huge head and many bubbles constantly rising to the top of the glass.    Overall this is a good beer. Sessions aren't really my thing and this is no exception. Decent for what it is, but I'd reach for a pale ale over almost any session and this is no exception.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Slightly hazy, amber in color. Thin, foamy head with streak lacing. The aroma is very light. Orange zest and caramel malt.

Definitely very sessionable, but not a ton to hold my interest beyond being a thirst quencher.

It has a great bit of citrus, with mild malt flavor. It is super crushable and a great beer when you just want to take it a little easy. Again, I consider this the best one in this style. Founders is my go to when I don't know what I want since they produce high quality beer.

The 4.7 alcohol content is an asset when I want a beer well before bedtime, and the price is competitive. Poured cold from a can into a thin walled glass. The initial hop aroma is good and strong; the color is rich amber. The beer develops a fairly thick, lasting white head. Taste is satisfying, with a tilt toward fruity, bitter hoppiness. Moderate lacing as the glass is emptied.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 This beer was my first session IPA. It was delicious! I bought a 6 pack of these, believing I wouldn't be disappointed by something that said "IPA" in the title. And disappointed I wasn't. However, the cans I got were very over carbonated. When I opened up the can, and later I found every can did this, beer rose to the top real quick and spilled over. Messy, sticky. I was not pleased with that. I told Founders and they compensated with really cool merchandise! So, to the beer itself  Appearance: pours a typical IPA amber, touch lighter maybe. Overcarbonated as it was, I was able to pour a reasonable head on it.   Aroma: Citrusy and tropical fruits.   Taste: Follows the nose with some pleasant malt sweetness. Balanced. My favorite type of IPA  Overall: It's delicious. It has a good citrusy tropical punch with a balance of malts on the front. Balanced IPA's are the way to go!  Update: I've been I'm search of my go to beer for over a year. After trying this beer, then trying others and then revisiting this beer, I think I found my go to with this one. It's just well balanced and my friends and family that aren't IPA fans love it. Keeping it in the fridge will be a must   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Poured from 19.2oz bottle into Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned on April 27th 2017. A bit old and a revisit so let's see here.     L: Clear gold, with an off-white two finger head that has moderate retention.     S: Gentle aroma, light citrus note of grapefruit with some nice floral notes. Super light aroma of malt.     T: Again very light flavors, citrus and floral with some herbal backnotes as well. Definitely a Session IPA. This is better than when I had it last and probably because my palate has changed.     F: Light, crisp and semi-dry.     O: Much better than last time, which was quite some time ago. I like this.

But when the leaves start changing, I stop drinking  L: Much lighter than a typical IPA but would never be mistaken for Bud  S: Yep, there's hops in there. Some, anyway.  T: Took some getting used to, honestly. Initially thought it tasted like an IPA-flavored light beer. Eventually came into its own, though. Skillfully made.  O: If the only think you don't like about summer is that it isn't IPA weather, give this a try. It's weird, but it works.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Not the most spectacular IPA but for a 4.70 ABV, it's solid, probably the best of the low ABV IPA's I've had. The color was yellow with a tint of orange. A nice half inch white head that remained for a while after pouring. There were aromas of pine that is fresh and earthy. The flavors were more mild. Malt sweetness is medium and the hop bitterness comes in quickly but not assertively. Mild citrus and mild pine. It has a light bodied mouthfeel but not as low as I expected. This will definitely be my next beer of choice on the next outing trip.

Smell is a nice piney and citrusy note. Taste is mild up front hop bite with pine and grapefruit. An easy drinking IPA light of sorts for whe you want to pound beers but stay straight. Like it says on the can though "drink responsibly because they don't serve Founders in the clink"

Slight hazy in texture and dark gold in color, thick frothy white head builds up and stands with good retention before slowly sinking to thin everlasting foamy sheet on the surface, plenty of sticky lacing web and patch appeared along the glass-side.    Loads of hoppy goodness with notes of citrus, kaffir lime, floral, resin, pine, and somewhat earthy yet grassy while malt is also there with notes of sweet breadiness and caramel.    Nice hoppy flavor with notes of juicy citrus, pine, oily resiny, there is a bit spicy also. Malt establishes as a flavor canvas with a sweet breadiness while it is hop again in later stage to wrap up all the things with a clean bitterness at the end.    Light to medium body with smooth mouthfeel from its lively carbonation, the feeling is crisp and refreshing, dry and clean finish.    Really go direct and not complex in order to be sessionable, anyway, it does not compromise in the part of hop. It still has vivid and lively hop character in both aroma and flavor.

A - Golden and clear  S - Slight hop aroma with citrus notes present  T - Vaguely hoppy  M - Heavy on carbonation  O - I rated this low because of the apparent marketing ploy to get IPA lovers to drink pilsner-style beers.

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Founders All Day IPA. 12oz can, served in a clear plastic cup. Packaged 05/31/16 19:24:03    Appearance: Mostly clear golden amber with just a bit of haze. 1/8” Thick rocky off-white head with sheets and fine strands of persistent lacing.     Smell: Faint citrus aroma. Surprisingly not very aromatic.     Taste: Nicely bitter. Classic pine and grapefruit bitterness up front, and an equal amount of bitterness at the end. Malt for balance is nearly non-existent, or at least I’m not tasting it much.     Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, a bit spicy and prickly. Some hop oils sticking to the teeth.     Overall / Drinkability: While I enjoy hops, I find this one is not “all day” for me. I need a bit more malt balance and less of the strong pine/citrus hop profile. It’s good, but it’s not great. While only 4.7% ABV, not what I would call sessionable either. One is enough. It did go well with Indian food though.

Unassuming, golden hue with mild hop presence in both the nose and taste. Although sessionable, this would not be my brew of choice to drink all day.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25 Founders All Day IPA  Look: straw, or golden color with tons of carbonation and a large off white fluffy head. I noticed there was not alot of lacing. In fact not much at all. That is kind of odd for an IPA.  Nose: Citrusy hops, lighter malts, grassy  Taste: Kind of the same as the smell. The hops are there and you can tell they are somewhat citrusy, but it is pretty light in flavor. I have had it on tap and it tasted better. This was out of the bottle. The aftertaste is the same as some of the IPA's, but it is just so much weaker and less bitter. If you wanna sit there and sip beers this is the one for you. Maybe good for someone transitioning from lagers to pale ales. It tastes more like a regular pale ale.   Mouth feel: very light, crisp, thin and refreshing.   Overall: It is more like a regular pale ale than an IPA and would be good if you can't hang with the strong hops bitterness of the real IPA's.

You do even pull faint lime notes instead of oranges or grapefruit.    F: Light and crisp in the mouth and not punishingly bitter at all. Clean, easy drinker.    O: Drinks too damn easy and is a great IPA to introduce people who are new to craft beer or for those that are looking for a summer alternative to mass produced beers "with lime."

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Pours a clear honey yellow with a thick white head that dissipates quickly and leaves decent lacing. The aroma is fairly citrusy. The flavor is all citrus with some nice hop bite. Crisp and clean on the tongue. Nice session beer.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Poured from a can to a shaker glass. Color is a light amber to gold with an off-white head, foam is thin and did not last long. Smells strongly of pine with a hint of citrus. A little malt flavor leading into citrus and pine with a bit of bitterness. Finish is citrus and clean, does not linger long. Feel is light and airy, easily drinkable on a hot day or as the name implies, all day. Good session IPA.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Bottled on Feb 24th and reviewed May 29th, so take the 90 day period into account. We're slowly going through the 'sessionable IPAs and there does seem to be a lot of them. The Founders version pours a nice, rich amber that says 'IPA' and has a good head and lacing. Aroma has floral hop notes which fade a little as the beer sits. Taste is hop forward and dry with some astringency. The beer is not as smooth as some of the others. Overall, a good IPA and easy on the ABVs. Founders does not know how not to make a bad beer.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Picked up a fifteen pack (sweet gimmick, like old Stroh's) today at Lowes Foods. Reddish golden color with spotty, soapy head with miniature lace. Nose is cirus based with a touch of bitter pine. This is a beer I've planned on reviewing for a while.     Solid bitterness throughout the flavor, mostly pine and lemon. Unfortuanely, I do feel there is an abundance of carbonation midway through the sip. The aftertaste, like the whole beer, is pleasant but restrained. Texture is mostly okay apart from the carbonation.     I guess I'd characterize this as the "light beer" version of an IPA if that didn't sound so preposturous. Decent, and probably tasty while paddling up a river but not an IPA to look for generally.
