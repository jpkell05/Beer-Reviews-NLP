Has a mild citrus and gentle spice character - kicks off herbal and floral aromas... Feel is smooth but lively, amply carbonated, mildly sweet, mildly bitter... Very easy to drink...     Definitely not my style but a decent enough beer for what it is...

Aroma is grain / wheat, honey, yeast, but the aroma is subdued.  Taste is very similar to the aroma, much more bitter than the aroma hints at but not off putting. The wheat is more subtle than most wheat beer but it does come through. It is not overly complex but still flavorful and makes for an easy to enjoy beer. Goes well with food as it isn't too strong on it's own that it takes away from anything else

Lots of fine head that sticks around for a bit, but leaving merely okay lacing.    Scent is honey wheat bread. This is what I'm looking for in a wheat brew. Mellow, yet the scents that are there have some depth, like you get when something is fresh.    Field-fresh wheat is both the canvas and the color. There's also a barley-like grain flavor, as well as white grapes. It's not complex, but for the type, it's again about ideal. Finish is honey and light herbs.    Aftertaste is a far diminished version of the taste. Carbonation is a bit prickly, and it's easy to bring out with a swish around the mouth. I get a surprising amount of alcohol for a fiver. Weight is pretty good, though.

Hazy, cloudy look with many large chunks of particulates floating around like pieces of cheese - not appealing in the least bit. Mild, rather nondescript grainy aroma. Taste is citrusy, lacking the spice that one would generally expect from the style. Mouthfeel is on the creamier side. Overall, not bad but not great - perhaps it would benefit from the addition of some spices.

The head slowly dissipates into a thick blanket of foam, leaving plenty of sticky cobwebs of lacing along the way. Beautiful beer.    The aroma is very bready and yeasty, with notes of lemon, grass, and subtle notes of clove and spicy hops.    The flavor is more of the same. Lots of wheat bread and yeast. Some citrus rind and spicy hops.     The feel is medium-light with moderate carbonation. Refreshing and highly drinkable.    Overall, a pretty good beer that's entirely underwhelming, but it's drinkable as hell and I'm pretty sure that's exactly what they were going for here.

I feel it's highly overrated, at least here in Michigan. To me it's just an OK beer. Personally I don't think this beer is worth the cost @ around $9/6 pack. I can get a 12 pack of a cheaper beer like Old Milwaukee or PBR for the same price. I think those are much better beers anyways. Individual bottles of Oberon can be had at Meijer stores for $1.99 each.

I might have got a bad batch, it is a good beer just isn't as good as I remember it.   The beer pours a hazy orange, with a good amount of head. This beer is unfiltered and it shows as the last of the beer pours out there is a fair amount of sediment (not unappealing). The smells is sweet: wheat, spices and orange. Taste is a slight hint of orange, spice and a lot of wheat. The mouthfeel is more full then I remember. Overall this is a good summer sipper.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5 From Bell's Brewery comes something different, Oberon, an American Pale Wheat Ale. Heard lots about this beer on social media and was fortunate enough to get my hand on a bottle, here in NoCal through a co-worker.    Oberon pours a cloudy, golden color with particulates floating under a thick and rich looking, off-white head.    Aroma was citrus and fruity with a definite wheat presence and a clove-like spice.    Taste wad a good mix of citrus flavors the orange standing out, followed by an earthy, grainy type of flavor before finishing with a touch of spice.    Crisp and clear, at 5.8% ABV it's a tru summer time brew.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Pint Can poured into Glass @ Nonic Bar and Kitchen - Columbus, Ga    This shit is goood. Poured a nice orange hazy color with a small amount of head. Smelled like wheat beer, subtle and not overwhelming in any sense. Felt smooth and refreshing, could easily knock down a few of these every hour. Very subtle orange/citrus taste and not overly malty. First time I ever had this beer was at Bonnaroo in 100F, perfect beer for a warm, active day as it doesn’t weigh you down.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Pours dark cloudy orange/yellow. Head is off-white with good retention. SlightLacing.  The nose has a bit of funk. A good funk. There is orange, sour lemon and heavy wheat notes.  There is tons of orange and grains upfront. Finish is sweet and sour with some lingering bitterness.  The mouthfeel is good. Its medium bodied and smooth with plenty of carbonation as to not weigh it down.

My understanding from the Brewery's website, is that this is a wheat beer but brewed using Bell's special house yeast, so all of the spicy notes from the magic of the hops and not from added spices. My only gripe is that is a bit heavy for what it is described as being, a great summer beer.     Very full mouthfeel.   
look: 3 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 5 Oberon is an old friend; back in the day it was called Solsun and sold in 22 oz bottles that were perfect for enjoying on the front porch on a hot summer day. It's still the taste of summer for me.    Purchased 6 pack of bottles from a local grocery chain. Pours orange yellow with an aroma of wheat, yeast and citrus. I have always found Oberon to taste like it smells; wheat and yeast dominate with a citrus note. It has a smooth mouth feel and a dry finish. It pairs nicely with grilled foods, especially chicken.

Yeast.   Taste follows the nose, it's not simple or complex...somewhere in the middle with definitely enough to keep interest and come back for more.  Full bodied. Low to medium carbonation. Clean and finishes quick and dry...a plus.

Murneau's masterpiece, Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans would look like if it was shot in technicolor. Taste is like waking up next to Alesandra Ambrosio on a cloudy day, and then having her freshly squeeze you some orange juice - I can get used to this. It's not the most vibrant, it doesn't speak to me like Sartre at midnight, but it is there and proud. And that is enough for the Raul man.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 From Siciliano’s in Grand Rapids MI ON March 26 - Oberon release day. Pours a slightly hazy amber golden with fruity citrus aroma with bit of yeast. Taste citrus - orange, slightly grainy, mild clove with touch of spicy hop. Smooth juicy mouthfeel, well carbonated. Though still winter like while consuming does taste like spring - really good.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Grand Rapids local Family Fare sells a ton of Bell's products. Pint can poured into a Witbier curved glass.     Orange to amber pour with a thick couple inch head. Little to no lacing and aesthetically pleasing. Aroma is of huge wheat presence with undertones of orange peel and a typical malt backbone. Mouthfeel is of standard wheat taste but is most definitely of a higher quality than domestic wheat beers. The orange notes are diminished and very subtle to the taste. It's an interesting beer that definitely isn't something to write off. I see why many people rant and rave about Oberon but I'm not overwhelmed

look: 3.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Pours a hazy gold amber with a finger and a half head that retains mildly well with a small amount of lacing.

The LA version is okay (made year round by, who I assume, are local brewers) but the Michigan version can't be beat. This is the beer that Blue Moon and Shock Top probably wish they could aspire to be but can't. This is a summer time favorite in the colder climates that would be perfect to enjoy year-round in warmer climates.

The spicy and earthy wheat makes a nice wheat Ale. Crisp and refreshing. Great for a hot day.   Overall, a great wheat to choose on a hot day.

Taste is some orange with rather bland malts. Feel is nice- highly carbonated..medium bodied. Overall, seems to be more of a summer easy sipper. Not a lot going on to like or dislike really.

The taste is an exceptional one with similar notes to the nose and sweet malts, bread, cumin, back pepper and a touch of pine. Great balance and very excellent overall flavor. I love it.

Smell is pleasant blend of light citrus, with a lean towards orange zest, and biscuit/wheat malt.    Taste is very good with a great wheat/biscuit flavor, solid hop spice and delicious orange/citrus zestiness.    Mouthfeel is crisp, moderately carbonated, starts with a fuller presence then has a lingering dry/spiciness on the tongue.    Overall: a very good wheat beer with pronounced citrus and wheat flavors, light hop spice and dryer mouthfeel.

Aroma is orange peel and wheat. Lots of malts not a whole lots of hops. Smooth, barely biter.    Taste follows--oranges and wheat. Extremely smooth and mellow.    Feel is medium, perhaps a bit heavy. Very smooth and creamy. Easy drinking.     Overall, definitely a classic summertime beer. Not too hoppy, not too experimental, the flavors are just done right.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75 This beer is one my favorite beers to indulge in the summer. It has that golden blonde body. In Aerosmith the song Sweet emotion, when they sing it they give the sweet, a sweeet emotion, which the aroma is. Wheat and oranges. Perhaps a tint of apricot. It goes down very smooth. It has a citrusy orange flavor that delights your taste buds. Overall if you supply the Oberon I will be there with bells on.

Some nice ringy lacing was left. Some light slow carbonation was seen rising. The smell had some moderate flavors of wheat along with notes of orange and lemon. The taste was basically the same with a slight added hops to it and a nice bit of light acceptable sourness to it. The palate was about a light with a decent amount of carbonation hitting the tongue, but in a nice and acceptable way for the style. Overall, this is a good summer beer that is quite drinkable.

Overall this is a great summer beer, sweet on flavor with a nice punch of citrus fruits.

A light-drinking summer beer, with a pleasant lemon flavor, but not my favorite summer beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.5 Oberon is a fantastic summer beer. It's light feeling, but has a ton of flavor. If you like Coronas as a summer beer, try Oberon! I've been a fan for about 10 years. It's a beer that varies a bit from year to year, which is kind of nice. Lots of people add a slice of orange, but it's not required. It's quite fruity, but not overpowering, nor does it have a strong wheat beer flavor. It's also not too high in the ABV, so you won't get dehydrated as fast as some beers. Pick some up!

Beer is highly carbonated, but is not dry in the finish-- very refreshing indeed. Beer is very sessionable, just like a good summer beer should be.    I do prefer this to the other wheat ale by Bell's, Winter Wheat Ale. A good quality wheat ale and an excellent choice for a summer beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4 L: Hazy golden orange with a big creamy white head. Excellent retention and lacing.    S: Crackery and wheat malts; some mild banana character, orange, stone fruits, and subtle spice.    T: Big cracker and wheat malt flavors, doughy and chewy, bready--softly complimented by green and yellow banana subtle sweetness, orange and lemon peels, white peach, and on the finish, a dry and lightly spicy flavor; some clove, but leaning more towards basil or cilantro.    F: Medium-bodied, but leaning towards heavier with the pleasant silky-smooth, high protein wheat mouthfeel. A moderate carbonation pushes the beer across the palate smoothly and it becomes very drinkable, even with the creaminess.    O: An excellent American pale wheat ale. It's much more restrained than the typical banana-bubblegum-clove flavors of a German hefeweizen, but it still abounds with subtle flavors and is very pleasant to drink. This is deservedly a classic!

Pours a cloudy yellow orange with a two finger sticky white head that leaves behind some solid lace.     Smell is biscuit, coriander, mango, and lemon peel.    Taste follows nicely biscuit, clove, coriander, mango, and a little lemon.    Mouthfeel is less than medium, enough carbonation, not dry at all, and it was difficult to drink it in less than 5 minutes very crushable.     Overall not a style I normally go for, but this is a very nice beer. Thanks @jzeilinger for this.

Taste: Sweet orange ski and grapefruit, has smooth breadth feel which makes you think it was fused with orange zest.     Mouth: Medium body but sticky. Smooth finish.     Overall: Best beer so far of the day, went great while watching the Met game in this crazy heat. Always in a glass. Salud.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.5 16 oz can    Pours just over a finger of white head into my willi glass. I can hear it fizzing a little bit. The body is a very cloudy, dark orange. Carbonation looks quite high. Head retention is about average so far, maybe a tad below average. So far it looks ok.    The aroma on this is very nice. Has a full nose to it, it’s got girth. Pretty sweet, smells almost like there is lactose in here, but according to the can, there is not. You definitely pick up a significant amount of wheat, as well as some citrus. A little zesty, there are some nice yeast characteristic hiding in here as well. It just has this very creamy, flowery aura to it. Almost reminds me of a cremesicle, but not in a gross way. It does a nice job of not being too sweet. On some sniffs it has more of a dryness to it – for being a somewhat light aroma, it has a decent amount going on. Really a great smelling beer.    Hmm, flavor is definitely a little different. It doesn’t have quite the same creamy flavor as the nose gave off, or flowery flavor. It’s definitely drier than I anticipated. The malts are not very sweet, rather dry as well, and in your face – I get a lot of malt. Malt is relatively bland, not a much of a wheat flavor. Maybe a little citrusy, but not much at all really. Not a huge yeast characteristic either. This is what I expect a pretty standard American Wheat to taste like, and for that reason, I’m not terribly impressed. The nose had me very excited, but this is very one dimensional, and not too exciting. There aren’t any off flavors, and I know this is a light style, but still, very underwhelming. Overall, it’s ok.    The mouthfeel has some body to it, it’s a relatively thick wheat beer, which is nice. The carbonation is medium-low. It’s a nice mouthfeel.    The drinkability is very high. It’s not incredibly tasty, but it’s light and it certainly doesn’t taste bad.    The appearance turned out pretty good. The head quickly dissipated quite a bit. However, it settled down to a substantial film, that lasted quite some time down the glass. The lacing was pretty decent from top to bottom. Body was never a problem. Overall, pretty good looking beer.    Overall this is a bit of a letdown, I haven’t cheated and looked at reviews before reviewing it myself, but I gather this is a pretty highly regarded wheat beer. I’m probably giving it a rough grade on flavor because it smelled so good, and the difference is really noticeable. Still, any way you cut it, there just isn’t a lot going on here. Overall, ok.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.75 The beer pours a cloudy yellow when decanted - leaving quite a bit of sediment in the bottle. The head was an off white color, about a half inch, and it lingered nicely.    The smell seems subdued. It is bready and yeasty initially, with lemony citrus coming out after a few sniffs. There is some spicy character and floral floating over the top.    The taste is rather on the sweet side and bready. More lemon emerges as the beer sits and warms, and the spicy notes hang in the background. It all ends up being fruity and floral with just a little clove-like spice in the background.    The feel is slick and smooth, lively enough carbonation to keep it from being coating and annoying.     Overall, a very nice wheat beer that I would recommend when you want something on the lighter side of things.

Smell: Layered wheat and grains with a good dose of yeasty and hoppy spice and fruit.    Taste: Clean wheat and grains continue from the nose with light orange citrus and spicy yeast notes. Earthy hops and just a bit more bitterness than most wheat ales.    Mouthfeel: Light to medium body, creamy smooth with soft but refreshing carbonation.    Overall: Satisfying layers of grain, yeast and hop flavors provide more depth and complexity than a typical wheat quencher.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 On tap at the Winking Lizard in Columbus Ohio. Served with orange slices. Great summer beer. I have had this beer before in bottle and on tap. I prefer on tap. When I see it I know summer is coming. Very drinkable. Light fruit smell and taste. Wheat beer very smooth. I could drink these all day. Pours a hazy Amber color with a thin head. Very tasty.

look: 3.75 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Pours a deep straw, lots of fluffy white head that leaves moderate lacing. Smells barnlike in a bad way to me - got a definite animal waste smell. Settled down a bit with some fruit, coriander. Mild flavor, a bit sweet and fruity. Great mouthfeel, very refreshing.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12oz bottle from 06/16 I believe - was originally a little apprehensive buying a kinda old batch at this point, but have had it fresh and wanted to see what a few extra months did to it. Poured into a tulip, added a few drops of sediment partway through the glass to see what an extra kick of yeastiness would do.    L: Relatively clear brownish orange, but very hazy if a bit more yeast from the bottom kicks up. Looks a little like grapefruit juice if hazy, and like a typical APA if not. Nice white head, low lacing.     S: Yeast, sourdough bread, tangerine, orange, zest, honeysuckle, spicy.     T: Sweet orange, spicy hops, grass, and yeast.     F: Medium-low body, doesn't cling too long, but the zesty hop finish reminds you it's still an APA.     Overall, one of my preferred examples of American wheat ales. Quenching and sweet, but balanced with a nice punchy hop bill.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 This beer pours a murky golden color. The head was 3 finger, frothy, white, and dissipated fairly quickly.   The nose is got a slight citrus hue to it. Fairly mellow. Slight banana from the wheat also.  The taste is somewhat muted. There is the banana taste to it. There is also some citrus from the hops.   The feel is lighter bodied. There is a good feel from the carbonation going down.   Delicious as always, and a good beer to get.

Pours a hazy orange golden color with an inch of white head that retreats to a ring around the glass. Almost no lacing. Smell is wheat malt and bitter orange. Taste is predominantly wheat malt driven with some subdued orange flavor. Mouthfeel is full and soft offset by sharp carbonation. Overall, good. This is a classic summer wheat beer that most anyone can enjoy. Some may find the lack of spices, fruits or weisen yeast to be boring, but this is just a well made beer needing nothing extra to do it's job.

If you're wanting to try Bell's, Oberon is a great start into exploring the brewery.

Color- a foggy or hazy yellow, like urine.  Feel- goes down smooth, almost too smooth. Has a domestic beer feel to it.   Body- pours full with a 1 inch head that disappates shortly after  Smell- pure orange peels and some lemon lingers barely   Overall- this beer is a poor man's craft brew. Tastes slightly better than Blue Moon which isn't anything to brag about. I can't express how disappointed I was in this. I personally didn't taste the malts. Very yeasty beer with too much orange peel flavor. Won't be having this one ever again.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured to a tulip glass.    A: The body is yellowish with some darker hues. The head is one finger thick showing good retention and some good lacing as well.  S: The aroma has strong profiles of malts, yeast and just a small hint of alcohol. Hops profile is minimal. A bit earthy and no fruitiness.  T: The taste is much more fruity, having a strong profile of tangerines and oranges - the citric touch is very rich. In the back, there's a malty touch connecting very well with the hops.  M: Body is medium to medium low. Carbonation is high though not visible. Bitterness is medium to medium high.  O: I think I'm kinda into American Wheat Pale Ales, it's not the first one and I'm digging this style currently.

A bit of fruitiness and hopiness but not overwhelming. Perfect for summer and what beer was designed for.

Pale hazy yellow / orange color from the tap in to the glass. Noticed small floaters throughout.. First taste is wheat for sure followed by citrus toward the back end. Nothing amazing , but I it is a solid go to beer. Usually , when this one is released, summer is right around the corner!

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Light golden color, large white fluffy cap.    Smells nicely beery, a bit floral, very lightly citrus, a rounded, gentle scent.    Taste is uncomplicated and clean. It's fuller and more nuanced than what we usually think of as a "light beer" being both flavorful and refreshing at the same time. The body has heft without weight and a nice nutty undertaste. Just a touch of hops in the finish and aftertaste, in fact the whole thing is light handed yet the parts come together beautifully. Nothing stands out, everything fits in, and you're left with the warm feeling of having made a new friend.    It takes skill to pull off a brew that looks so easy. Others do it as well but these lighter styles leave little room for mistakes and this one is nigh flawless, a good example of what craft beer is all about. This beer was made for refreshment and does it well. I can't think of any reason why I should pick this one over a selection of well made craft wheat ales, but then again I can't think of any reason why I shouldn't.

Nice pungent aroma, quickly dissapating head, great looking hazy yellow with bits of yeast floating around. The taste is an almost perfect balance of malts and hops. Nice and spicy with creamy texture. I hate that this is not available year round because it stays hot down here in the south a lot longer than it does in Michigan, where this is made.

The feel is very smooth. The taste is full without being in your face. Nice hops finish. Very drinkable. This will be one of my GO TO pale ales.

look: 4 | smell: 2 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.25 This is a nice light Ale with a mildly cloudy appearance and decent lacing. Not much head to speak of. I was able to detect very little aromas on the sniff other than slight acidity and some mild citrus.   Mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied for a lighter flavored beer.   A great introductory ale most light beer drinkers should enjoy. Will try this out on my husband who has only recently graduated from Bud Light to Blue Moon I think he would like it a lot.   Flavors range from citrus to baked goods - bready and yeasty.   Yeast being a predominant flavor even in after taste.   Carbonation is sparkly.   Overall a mild flavored brew with some hints at spice but not overly so whatsoever - more of a spicy tingle on the tongue than flavor.   Not necessarily my cup of tea - I mean beer - but I can absolutely see this being a gate way beer to better beers than your typical Bud by far!   Hoppiness present but no where near that of an IPA obviously but they are detectable.   After taste is somewhat hoppy and slightly bitter but not so strong your lager drinkers would be repulsed.   Solid for what it is marketed for and one of my more loved Wheat Ales to date.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 L: Hazy amber color, half finger white had, nice lacing, good carbonation.    S: Wheat, bread, biscuit.    T: Bready, malty.    F: Nice mouthfeel, refreshing.    O: Nice wheat beer.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Solid hazy orange pour with a small white head and noticeable yeast particles at the bottom after settling. Smells lightly sweet and sticky, but no particular notes to pick out (I have a terrible sense of smell). The taste is of light clove spice and a nice sweet and tangy-refreshing wheat character. Noticeable hops at the end that linger slightly giving a mild astringency. Medium-high carbonation, medium-dry, with a thicker than normal mouthfeel for an American wheat. Overall, an excellent wheat rendition, equally thirst quenting and flavorful.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 I finally got to try Oberon, a beer that has a lot of hype in my neck of the woods. The beer left a head that lasted in the glass forever. The beer itself has a nice golden cloudy color. It did leave a bit of lacing in the mug as I drank it. Overall, it's a nice looking beer. It smells like a pilsner/lager with lots of wheat, oats, and barley. Wheat seems to be the main ingredient, I could defiantly taste it from the start. It reminds me of a lager upfront. The back end of the beer was kind of bitter with an overlap of citrus, with a light spice and a small amount of hops. Overall, a very light and smooth taste with wheat standing out as the main ingredient. I agree with the people who say that this could be considered a wheat ale. Overall, this beer reminded me of a high class lager. It's not terrible, but I don't think it necessarily lived up to the hype that people give it. I would drink it again. I enjoyed the summer feeling that the beer gave off, and that's what it's marketed for. So give it a try if you can find it. (Especially if you like lagers like me.) Summer is almost over and it will be gone, so go get a 6-pack.

The glass had thick lacing the whole time. Nice cloudy golden color.     As for everything else I tend to agree with the reviewer that said this may have technically been a wheat brew, but in tast was a pretty respectable pilsner.     Would make a great summer afternoon/evening session beer, which is just what it is marketed as on the can.

Aroma is wheat, yeast, and some slightly overripe banana. Taste follows with yeast, wheat, unbaked bread dough, overripe banana, and hints of spicy hops and floral tones. Mouthfeel is thin to medium and carbonated but a bit oily. Overall, a pretty good American wheat ale, although a metallic profile comes through.

It smells of wheat, orange peel, and spice. The taste follows the nose with a subtle orange-wheat flavor. There is also a hint of spice and hops at the finish. This ale is light and slightly creamy. At 5.8% it is very easy to drink. It nicely complimented the Cuban sandwich with which I drank it. Overall, it is a well-crafted and enjoyable American Pale Wheat Ale.

Towering head of 3 fingers, leaving spotty lace amongst a couple broken webs.     Aroma is weak in volume but the characteristics are there - honey-tinged wheat, salted pretzel, peeled orange.     Flavor is rich and wheaty, touches of orange peel, with wheat thins and pretzel. It's incredibly refreshing, undoubtedly creamy, and has a great semi-dryness on the finish.    Bell's Oberon is a great adventure. I imagine I'll be picking more up this summer when we cross the border to camp in Iowa. Nice work again, so glad I could try this.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 12 oz. bottle into a Helles glass    A - Moderate pour produces a 1 1/2 finger head in height and the head is bright white in color with a light frothy appearance. The head dissipates very slowly. The beer itself is hazy with the yeast visible and moderate to high carbonation visible in the form of small bubbles racing toward the surface of the beer. 4.25/5     S - There is a very distinct yeast aroma to the beer with an earthy, musty character as well as a bit of light caramel and rye bread. The aroma is not as sweet and much more earthy than expected. A bit of orange peel and peppery spice comes through as well with hints of herbal hops. 3.5/5     T - Light caramel and multi-grain Cheerios come out right away along with a bit of an earthy yeast note than gradually increases in intensity. Orange peel as well as a hint of orange flesh, peppery spice, and musty hay come out in the middle of the flavor profile which is then finished off by a bit of grass and herbal hops. Not much in the way of bitterness with no real lingering bitterness either. 3.75/5     M - Moderate carbonation burn up front which gradually diminishes over the course of the sip. Slight drying on the back end with an ever so slight lingering dryness. Light to medium bodied in stature. 3.75/5    O - I had high expectations for this beer and unfortunately it just didn't live up to those expectations. The yeast profile of this beer really throws me off for a wheat ale. It's much more of a Belgian than American wheat to me. Light drinking and fairly sessionable, this beer is well balanced between sweet and bitter. 3.75/5

look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Poured from a mini-keg into a shaker glass. Color is a pale, straw yellow with a decent head, about finger, that is white. Some carbonation drifting to the top of the glass. Smells heavily of wheat with a little bit of citrus. Taste is much the same, like a wheat cracker with a hint of citrus, maybe oranges? Taste does not linger at all, body is very light with little carbonation. Very crisp beer, great for summer and a staple in my fridge.

Very good head volume, average retention and outstanding lacing.    Good nose of light lemon and wheat cracker.    Light body that is smooth. Outstanding carbonation / body balance. A light effervescence at the beginning that gains strength and closes with a nice prickly finish.    The flavor profile is very good but lacks a bit of complexity. Intensity and balance are outstanding. Light lemon and wheat cracker arrive initially. Mid palate delivers a subtle bitterness and an equally subtle biscuit sweetness. Clove becomes the main component from the middle on riding over the wheat. The finish is somewhat crisp and light clove lingers.

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5 Oberon pours to a thin, pebbly white head that immediately begins to decay to a thin ring, perched atop a borderline hazy/cloudy, effervescent pale gold body. Lacing is scant, just fast-retreating spots and blobs. The aroma is super-light, consisting of hints of citrus, cracker and indeterminate spice. The flavor is more assertive, being moderate in intensity: a somewhat murky wheat malt flavor with hints of estery spice and a slight yeast presence, all hedged in by a moderate brightish earthy/spicy hop bitterness. The finish is pretty clean, being just a bit of wheaty caramel, followed by a modest earthy rebound bitterness that lingers for awhile. Mouthfeel is slightly big for the light body, and is a bit astringent; the texture is medium-creamy and prickly from the assertive carbonation. (12 oz bottle, 41 days after pkg)

The beer clouds up, after the "swish & pour". Aroma is of spices (alligator pepper?), sweet, white bread, and maybe sourdough. Taste is of slight banana, alligator pepper, white pepper, coriander, a shade of banana, white wheat bread, possible bubble gum, and practically no bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and fluffy, and Oberon finishes drinkable and semi-dry.     RJT   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Three things signify the beginning of Michigan's summer: the end of hockey playoffs, 80 degree weather and the release of Bells Oberon. I know people that go crazy for it but I'm not one of them. I think it was perhaps the first craft beer to really emerge on the Michigan beer scene 10+ years ago and therefore has a historical significance to Michigan beer drinkers. It told us that it was ok to put the Bud Light down and try something new.    With respect for what it is and to its success, it's not my favorite but it's decent. You get a blend of citrus notes and some rich wheat malt on its own but gets a boost when the bartender adds a slice of fruit to it.

To me this beer kind of tastes dirty, not sure what it is about it. If I had to choose an orange-flavored beer, I would actually go with Blue Moon over Oberon. It's a great beer for the summer, something for my palate is just a bit off.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25 This is a very easy going wheat ale. Not a lot of complexity, but a great drink to have on a patio in the spring/summer time. This beer has some spicy hop characters to it as well as mild fruity aromas. This is a smooth drink, and is very enjoyable, just don't expect anything extremely bold and exciting.

I am not saying I do not enjoy Oberon or love it, but I would prefer something else when choosing.   Aroma has light hops and a nice blend of citrus fruits such as lemons and oranges .   Flavor is very light and refreshing. I really enjoy the citrus and orange flavors that are balanced well with the bitterness of the hops and wheat.

As inviting as it appeared, I was somewhat underwhelmed with the taste. It was a nice, lightly sweet, lightly spiced flavor. Very mild hops on the front. The smell was almost nonexistent for me. I probably wouldn't go this way again. It was, however, certainly refreshing with a zest that could squelch the summer heat.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Had this on tap. Body was a hazy, honey type color. Thin white head that left good amounts of soapy lacing. Smells lemony and yeasty. Taste has a lot of citrus flavor in the form of lemon and orange peel. There's some yeasty/hay type smell and taste at work here too, along with some bready maltiness, and hop spices (clove, coriander). Feel is okay, I expected it to be a little lighter and fizzier than it was. I thought it seemed just a touch too heavy. Really nice soft mouthfeel though. Overall, a refreshing summer beer that really highlights the full spectrum of yeast and wheat flavors.

Just a slight bit of bitterness.  FEEL: Medium body, good level of carbonation, and it has that soft wheat beer consistency.  OVERALL: The little bit of funk might turn off some but I like it. It is pretty refreshing for the body it has, and some nice citrus notes. Pretty good stuff.

F: Full mouthfeel that drinks so well but causes some trouble in my stomach. Avoid drinking this with fried food as there is some volitile reaction that happens.    Overall: It's a very well rounded beer. The unpasterized side of things doesn't agree with my stomach, so I am biased in that regard.

As an avid "fruity" beer drinker, Oberon is actually not one of my favorites. I think that the bitterness overtakes the fruity flavor, making it less fruity than I typically like. The look of an Oberon is definitely something of beauty though. With a large heard and slightly orange smell, you can use your senses to spot an Oberon easily. The palate is fizzy but refreshing. Overall, Oberon is worth the hype that it gets!

But still it's a decent beer but not great.

But apparently the deman for mainland craft stuff is on the rise here, and this was super fresh, bottled just over one month ago. Hazy with some mild sedimentation but still bright to look at, with over an inch of slowly expanding white foam. More hops that expected for a wheat beer in the nose, spicy, grassy, zippy, and distinctly European in nature on that front. Not much going on with the yeast in nose or taste, which I suppose allows the fresh cereal grain element to take center stage. It's fluffy and fuller bodied, extremely smooth. Crackers and biscuits come yo mi d, but it's pleasantly dry in the end, and while the hips are more mellow in flavor than aroma, they provide enough nuance to keep it interesting and unique on the back end. This refreshing summery brew is best when slugged down ice cold. It cuts the humidity of Puerto Rico beautifully, and I am already looking forward to finishing off the six pack in the fridge today. Bells dies some of their best work in their most basic styles, one mark of an expert brewer...

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Poured from a 12oz bottle into a nonic pint. Hazy gold in color, with quite a bit of sediment, and topped by a two-finger tall white head.    Aroma is bright, citrus, bread-y yeast notes, and a bit of a graininess, almost like dry grass.    Taste is a balanced mix of sweet malts and citrus right up front. Neither of these is totally dominant- they seem to compliment each other instead.. Some spice (coriander, pepper) and biscuit-y notes support this in the background, leading to a rather short finish dominated by a distinct yeast bite.    Mouth-feel is a medium, a bit more substantial than many wheat beers, but still very easy-drinking. Moderate carbonation only accentuates this.     Oberon isn't a terribly complex beer- it's pretty much a prototypical Hefe- style beer with no surprises- but it is very well done. While it perhaps could benefit from just a bit more depth in the malts, everything that is here is just where it should be. The crisp refreshing nature of this make it a natural beer for summertime, or anytime a light, clean flavored ale would suit one's fancy. It should be a nice beer to have in the rotation as a slight change of pace from lagers, wits, and the like.

S: Malts, biscuity, yeasty, hop profile is small but citrusy.     T: Biscuity malts, slight bitterness from citrusy hops, yeast. Touch of bubblegum.     F: Medium body, nice carbonation level, refreshing.     O: A solid beer from Bell's.    Notes from my first of 2017: 12oz into standard pint glass. Good head retention, keeps a thin layer after several minutes, also better lacing with a fresh one. Aroma is not much different but the flavor this year seems a bit more well rounded. I like 2017 better than 2016.    Later 2017, 16oz can into Weizen glass, canned on June 7th 2017. Great head of three fingers, excellent retention, one fingers width sticks around forever and leaves lacing all around. Great wheatiness in this one, lots of good yeast as well, orange zest, this can is popping with aroma! Wow this is the best Oberon I think I have had, maybe it's just my mood and the heat (San Diego) but super refreshing, lots of wheaty sourdough like biscuits, orange, spicy notes as well. The wheat lends incredibly smooth and creamy mouthfeel to this light and crisp beer. Best summer beer. This has renewed my hope in this beer which I thought had been lacking of late.    Notes from 2018 release: 16oz can into Weizen, head is just as great as last year’s. A touch more of bubblegum in the aroma this year. Aroma is very nice. More orange in the flavor and good bite from the spice layered over the wheatiness. Very good. Mouthfeel has stayed the same since last year. Overall this is as good as last year’s if not better.

The aroma is bready wheat with lots of yeast and some floral and citrus hops. The taste is floral hops and the wheat. Lemon, slight funk and more yeast at the end. Funky, wheat finish. Light body for the style and pretty drinkable. Overall, good Wheat Ale.

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5 Hazy orange with a large white head clinging like meringue.    Smell is pizza dough to me, all the way. There are some mild esters and a subtle spice, but this really reminds me of pizza dough.    Taste is bready and smooth wheat nicely accented by pear and other light esters that contribute a little sweetness with a hint of spices.    Medium-full with a round carbonation, Oberon is easily drinkable despite some components that might sound heavy.

T: Slightly tart, wheat twang, spicy, citrus, lemon, hints of tangerine, floral, faint fruity notes, maybe a touch of bready yeast, and some honey sweetness.

I also get an oatmeal-like aroma as well.    Taste is rather simple. It is what the nose describes: citrus and wheat. The citrus is rather non-descript but it's presence is noted. The wheat is the predominate flavor of this beer, which climaxes in flavor near the end of the sip. It is super refreshing and goes down very easy. No bitterness at all to this one. Medium body with a great amount of carbonation.    Overall, this is a easy drinking beer. I will buy it again for sure. Super sessionable, but I almost desire a bit of bitterness to cut through the rather monotonous notes of wheat and citrus. I see this pairing well with just about anything. A nice farro and orange salad with citrus grilled shrimp would be nice! It gets a 84.5/100.

Golden , highly carbonated with about a 2 finger head. This reminded me a lot of a Heineken and had a lemony citrus taste with a hint of hops at the end.

Really cloudy, with a really nice looking billowy head that shows no sign of receding, enabled by the substantial amount of wheat in the mash and lack of filtration.    S: Very yeasty. The wheat is pretty noticeable, with a hint of lemon zest (wish there was more). Very musky, like an attic, and not entirely pleasant.    T: Dry and drinkable upfront, with some substantial hop bitterness and a tad of sweetness. Taste is wheaty, earthy and very light. Following aroma, a hint of lemon. Very dry finish.    F: Medium-light body. Medium-high carbonation.    Overall: A very drinkable wheat ale for the summer. Not great, not too complex, but it serves its seasonal purpose. Not surprisingly for an unfiltered wheat beer, it has excellent head retention. Not a huge fan of the aroma; it reminds me too much of pure yeast.

Although it doesn't appear to have a lot of carbonation, it does upon sipping.     Not my favorite offering from bells.

This beer is a really crushable clean and easy brew. Reliable choice for a daily sixer. Thumbs up. Give this one a shot.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 Look:  Massive amounts of foam after pouring from a 12oz bottle. It is a deep gold / orange color that is a bit hazy.    Smell:  Smells of various citrus fruits and aroma hops. There is a strong bready / yeasty scent as well.    Taste:  There is a hop bitterness at first, but it quickly fades into a very wheaty / malty flavor. The tastes then turn towards tart fruit and sweetness. There are spice notes throughout that keep the flavor very interesting.    Feel:  Medium mouth feel. Feels fairly thick and syrupy with a lot of tongue tingling goodness.    Overall:  I really enjoyed this as it is different than all of the other "orangey wheat summer beers". This is a bit more interesting than many I have had lately and I would definitely buy this again. I grew up in Michigan, but never had one of these when I lived there. Definitely recommend.

It really blew me away for what it is... a drinkable summer wheat ale. Great pool beer. It may be weighted a bit too high given my expectations, but I call them how I see them. Will try again under different circumstances.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Hazy pale gold with thick head, decent retention and nice sticky lacing. Aroma is typical Belgian wheat with nice hit of citrus. Clean scent, clean taste, nice well-balanced beer. I would never suspect the 5.8%ABV. A delightful refreshing beer.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75 Yeast and wheat on the nose a bit of apricot. A bit sour on the palate with some lemon or orange zest. This came off as a bit watery to me. Decent summer beer but nothing special.
