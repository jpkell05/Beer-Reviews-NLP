look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 A hybrid of 2 of my favorite beers (IPA and Brown Ale) Also has a scotch ale in there as well, so I had to give it a try . I've heard amazing things about it. Head is a dark red color. Smell some chocolate and caramel and a little fruit as well. Taste definitely was good. Right off the bat you taste some cocoa, a little nutty, and some coffee hints. What shines through is you taste some hops, not West Coast IPA strength or even NE IPA strenght , but just enough to give this a little bite, more so than your typical brown ale. Mouthfeel is light, definitely tastes lighter than it's 7.2 ABV. It's definitely a solid beer, a little slightly overrated in my opinion but definitely solid. If you like Brown Ale's and IPA's it's a must try.

Since this is a hybrid brew, it's very accessible not only to IPA lovers but to people who like an ale as well. I have always liked the taste and feel of this brew, and it also makes a good holiday beer for this time of year as well as for warm weather - when you can find it. Definitely a keeper.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 From notes 7/24/12: Pours a very deep brown; garnet hues dance at the edges when held to the light. The pour produces 3 fingers of tan, variously bubbled frothy, lasting head that leaves beautiful webs and rings of lace. Aroma is dark bread, toast, dark fruits, brown sugar, dark cocoa with pine, burnt hints and smoke in a light floral and citrus hop background. Taste is brown sugar, raw, bitter chocolate and dark bread malt; not sweet, burnt, smokey and nicely bitter. Hoppy citrus, pine and herbal throughout the sip but intensifying from the middle through the peppery finish and intensely bittersweet aftertaste that rapidly fades to a lasting bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with moderate carbonation; smooth and easy to drink. May be called a brown ale but this stuff is in a style of its own. 4 stars

Overall, this is a great brown ale.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Pale/brown amber, translucent, frothy head with webby lacing. Smell kind of reminds me of smoke and charcoal but sweet and malty too. Not much in the way of hops as far as the nose. The taste remains largely the same, peaty, smokey brown ale with sweet and and sticky feel. Semi-dry. Complimented most lightly by the hoppiness, mostly just in the aftertaste in my opinion. The malty taste is sort of carried through by the hops though I guess it could be described as. Overall a solid beer. Found a couple six packs on sale for $5.00 a pop so I got a steal if you ask me.

In a nutshell, the mix of a brown ale along with Dogs' IPA brewing talents add up to a winner. If you like good beer...you'll like this. Simple as that.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Looks like Dogfish's Indian Brown Ale has added the word "Dark IPA" for rebranding. With same descriptors and ABV, I'll assume it's the same.    Anyway, this fella pours like a dark Scotch ale, with a deep brown look with clear amber hints at the edges of the glass. Head is minimal and even.    Aroma is like a porter. Malt, slight caramel and barley. Not getting any hops in the smell.    Their site describes this as a cross between a Scotch ale and a brown. Taste is more various. Tastes initially like a brown ale, with a light, lagery body, with a bit of bad coffee shop coffee. No chocolate. Caramel and a slight bite of hops comes in to suggest an IPA. Maybe I'm just looking at the label too hard. A little over cared. Slight hoppy bitter, some anise and hints of citrus and earth, through to the end. Those are the hops, right?    I'm also getting a feel of roasted barley, seems like it's close to a Guinness, no kidding, of the lightest variety.     But it falls short of a porter or a stout. Looks darker than it drinks. 7.5% ABV is pretty hidden. Ever so slight booziness, akin to how a Scotch or an IPA might feel.     Interesting mix of a brown with some added stuff like brown sugar and hops thrown in. Very drinkable, very well balanced. Interesting beer.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 One of my favorite DFH beers. I enjoy this more than 90 min. I'm not generally a huge IPA fan (will not drink more than 1 at any given time) but this is a pleasant mix of styles. Malts and caramel offset the hops just enough that they balance each other perfectly. No one flavor overpowers another, something I think a lot of brewers miss the mark on. You can taste all of the notes described very easily. Lacing on the glass through the entire beer and a great aroma. 4s all around for an above average beer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Indian Brown Dark IPA brewed by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, with an ABV of 7.20% This American IPA pours out a deep brown color with a nice off white head. This brew has the look of cola,not saying that is a bad thing. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness. Then sweet earthy roasted grains and malts. There is also a nice sweetness to this brew. Between the look and smell this is one inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with Roasted Hoppy Flavors. Reminds me more of a porter, than an IPA. It is also really hard to pick up on the 7.20% ABV in this American IPA, it is just that smooth. The body of Indian Brown Dark IPA is a solid medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. The mouth feel is Bold, Rich, Sweet, Roasted, Smooth, Clean and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Indian Brown Dark IPA a 4.50 out I 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, did a super nice job with this brew. If you are a fan of dark brews you should look this one up.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 This remains as one of my favorite Dogfish Head beers to this day. This beer has held up over the years unlike many of their new age experimental craft beers that they make. It's not a heavy & roasty type of brown ale, yet it is not an IPA either. This beer is almost like a style on it's own. I have noticed a few breweries on the east coast have tried to copy this beer over the years. I highly recommend this Brown Ale if you have not already had it. Cheers! B

If you accept that Dogfish Head combines three styles, Indian Brown is unique... and pleasantly so.    It certainly Looks like a Brown (or a Scots ale). The Smell also could be either style... except even I detect the hops. Tastes cascade starting with the dark malts balanced by the hops sweetened by the brewers sugar and then, inexplicably, finishes dry. I only give a great crafter this many points for their hoppy beer.    This might be a good ale for hop-heads to appreciate sweet browns.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 From a growler via Jungle JIm's Eastgate in a snifter. This fine ale pours a rich  ruby tinged brown with a fantastic head of off white foam that settles to a   thick ring, thin light pool, and showcases some nice sudsy lacing. Nose of   light cocoa, subtle citrus notes of orange zest, light brown sugars, and light   piney hops. Flavors exceed the nose with caramel and brown sugar touched  with orange zest and light peach notes touched with bread crust and awash   in herbal and light pine tinged hop flavors that balance out the malty characteristic  of the ale. Nice mouth feel; medium body, medium light carbonation that is   perfect and quaffable for the style, and a lightly hop touched malt finish.    The best parts of two styles in one....NICE.

The smell is very caramelly, with maybe a hint of maple. Tasting is where it really shows off ... Burnt sugar, caramel, molasses, more molasses, and a bit of dark chocolate. Should be cloyingly sweet, but it isn't. We're saved by the hops, this is an IPA after all, and that jolt of bitterness brings this into balance. I'm told that dry hopping means adding hops after the fermentation has completed to boost the hop flavor and aroma. It's works and it is brilliant!

Being called a "Dark IPA" I had no idea what to expect. I'm not sure there's a better name for it, but if your expecting a typical IPA you may not like this. Regardless, this beer is close to perfection for me! It comes across as a toned-down double IPA... like maybe the 90 minute's little brother, but maltier and heavier than the 60 minute. It has that hop bite and finish, but with the feel and taste of a strong brown ale. It also has some hints of dark fruit like what you'd find in an imperial stout. It's not overdone, and extremely well-balanced. I could easily knock out a few of these in one sitting. Great beer!

From the brewer I think is one of those that know how to put out an IPA, here's thing they advertise as a dark ale, really a brown ale, and has the muted flavor of an IPA. Speaking of muted - the only thing muted about this beer was it's smell. The scent was a muted blend of caramel and malts, with none of the hoppy background you would expect. The look is dark brown, decent head, and very, very good lacing. Mouthfeel was very full-bodied, definitely carbonated, but still a great smoothness across the tongue. The taste was distinctively malty right out of the bottle, but after it settled in the glass, the hoppy character made itself known and it was also distantly sweet. Overall, I found this to be definitely exceptional.

No hops but great start for an english style brown. Taste follows the nose until the finish. Malt, toffee, and some coffee make up the body before a bitter hopped finish. Medium-full body and medium carbonation with a lingering bitterness.  The malt backbone was heavily handedly done on the front and the hops at the end were too strong so the beer was too sweet to start and too bitter on the end. It tried to be malty and hoppy simultaneously. For me, it didn't work as well as the beer's reputation lead me to believe it would and should.

The beer pours very dark brown with only the slightest red hue if held to light. The head is tan colored and short lived. The aroma is dark chocolate and coffee. The taste is mild roast coffee and dark cocoa that ends with a mildly bitter note. Mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied, adequately carbonated and almost entirely dry in the finish. The hop presence is there in taste and feel, but it's impossible for me to single out specific flavors over the malt bill. Overall, very good, very balanced example of the style.

Overall - this really is quite a beer. i can't help but keeping sipping on it, and it sneaks up on you quick. really great in every way.

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 From notes taken 05/03/17:    Very deep garnet color, fairly clear, with spongey brown head of desert mud colored foam. Good retention, a ringed berm of lace, and then a wall of it below. Smells more like a Stout or even a Belgian Dark than most Brown Ales I’ve had, with cocoa, menthol, a little dark fruit. Taste is the same but everything is stronger and with the addition of molasses, and then toffee, the latter especially toward the finish. Hops are soily and strongest in the middle, along side a shot or two of ethanol. Good balance, should satisfy a sweet tooth or a hop head. Full-bodied, syrupy, fine-bubbled, tingly, and creamy, with surprising warmth for not only the style but the ABV as well.

Looks deep amber, mahogany. Smells like buttered biscuits,caramel, Flowery hops, mild ethyl, butterscotch. Full bodied, nice carbonation and head retention. Overall this is delicious. Not to knock Founders but this is wayyyy better than Dirty Bastard. Which says a lot. I really like this brewery and am ready to take a short road trip to visit the pub.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 This beer pours a dark clear ruby brown with an average head. The aroma features dark tones of hazelnut, chocolate, pine, orange peel, coffee, and greens. The flavor leans much more to the malt than the hops, with good medium chocolate, mild coffee, hazelnuts, almonds, and some orange peel, evoking a chocolate orange, and pine, with a really solid bitter core. THe mouthfeel is somewhat full with a light mildly carbonated finish. Overall this is really classy beer - unbalanced for the style, but iconically America in sensibility.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 Dark beer, not completely black, but brown as it says.  Dark chocolate, burnt caramel, molasses, brown sugar.  Effervescent flow over the tongue fades to brown sugar fades to bitterness hint of the hops behind all this. Nice.

Unremarkable aroma smells of straight caramel with some peanut brittle.    Balanced taste is delightfully nutty, with caramel and brown sugar adding complexity without dominating. Noble hops lend an even keel to tame the sweetness while remaining understated in their own right. Brown sugar comes through more on the back end with warming. A palpable stickiness lingers on the lips between sips. Medium body and fine, fulsome carbonation afford a vibrant, velvety mouthfeel that deftly cuts through the sweetness.    Overall, this is a robust, balanced brown ale with a great feel. One of the better Dogfish offerings, in my estimation.

The over all taste is complexly neither malt forward not hop forward... its bitter then sweet then creamy, not quite a coffee taste but that is the closes thing that comes to mind. It feels as silk does in ones mouth leading to a overall refreshing beer!

But sometimes the darker brews such as the porters and the stouts are too bitter in taste. This one is well-hopped, yet it's actually lightly brown-sugary sweet. I would say this is world class brew. Another solid product from Dogfish Head!

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 355ml bottle poured into a pint glass.    Translucent mahogany brown with an amber shade in color, it tops with a finger of frothy brown head that stands for a while before sinking to some bubble sheet atop and leaving some spotty and patchy lace on the glass-side.    Really nice aroma led by caramel, coffee, roasted, powdery, and toasted bread from malt as well as a sweet addition of brown sugar. Hop is herbal, fruity, and citrus.    The taste has a well-rounded balance between the two proportions of malt and hop. Malt provides its caramel, coffee, roasted, powder, and toasted bread as well as the addition of sweet brown sugar while hop lends its citrus and some herbal bitterness. The bitterness comes from both roasted malt and hop actually.    Medium body with quite smooth mouthfeel and moderate carbonation, the feeling is proper and crisp enough to carry all the things well. Finish is pretty dry.    Good Brown Ale with lots of typical caramel malt character and brown sugar in addition, hop also helps to bring some more depths.

The smell was awesome as it had a super nice allocation of the Scottish peat - like smokey/roasty malts to the engraving bittersweet citrus hops to delightfully entice my nose to partake in more whiffs to get some light roasty caramel nuttiness about it. The taste replicates the smell pretty much exactly the same. On the palate, this one sits about a medium. The carbonation seems appropriately made for the style and shows a decent smoothness about it. Overall, what an absolutely amazing beer - three styles in one and we’ll done.

I'm a big fan of Dogfish Head, there hasn't been any brew of theirs that I did not only thoroughly enjoy, but also hound my beer loving friends with recommendations.     All the look and smell of a stout but not the overpowering kick. Stouts are sippers, this dark ale is a comfortable medium between my usual IPA and stouts that I don't really prefer to drink. Two fingers of head, with a scent is of a distinct chocolate, and with somewhat toffee accents. The looks is very dark but up to the light it has a red hue deep within it. This brew has a warming quality going down too. I got a lot of lacing on the glass, for this is clearly what I call a glass washer. No aftertaste other than hints of chocolate that go down nicely. Overall it is a pleasurable drink for a quiet moonlight night.

The color is a dark brown with a medium head that lingers in the glass, The initial taste is somewhat heavy with a very roasty, malty, coffee feel and limited nose. I did not care for the aftertaste which is somewhat harsh and chalky. It gets better with food as you lose the finish. I did not notice the hop element even though it clocks in at 50 IBU. Overall pretty decent as long as you are ready for the aftertaste.

The head sticks around, and is of an on-tap quality. Smells of malts, burnt sugar, cardamom, and floral hops. The taste -- while similar to the aromas -- mostly accentuates the malts, making for a wholesome drink that focuses predominantly on breadiness/nutiness, with a slight spiciness. Reminds me a lot of Shed Mountain Ale, but less rustic.    83/100

It's pleasant but it ain't no IPA, not anywhere close. Tastes like a stout mixed with an ale. Minimal hops. If you're looking for hops, don't look here. I can absolutely understand the high ratings, but my palate has been corrupted by wonderful hops, so this just doesn't do it for me.

It looks super dark brown, bubbly over carbonated head, smells great like coffee and caramel. The taste doesn't live up to the smell. The first few sips are bitter and you can taste the alcohol in it. As you continue to drink it, the bitterness settles down and it;s a bit more enjoyable. However, this is not up there with the likes of an Old Brown Dog. Some may call this complex, but I'd say it's a bit off the mark.

Smell is coffee, brown sugar, pine, cedar, toffee, toast, milk and something a little sticky and acidic like maple and wine barrel.    Taste is not quite as complex as the nose but still good, with creamy toffee, milk, sharp pine, tangy malt and caramel.    Frothy and full-bodied.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Poured into a 13 oz Weyerbacher tulip glass bottled on 9/30/16. Pours a beautiful mahogany with a two inch off white head that leaves plenty of lace behind.     Smell is caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, and pine.    Taste follows caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and vanilla upfront with biscuit, pine, and a hint of grapefruit in the long lingering finish.     Mouthfeel is above medium, plenty of carbonation, a not really dry, and excellent drinkability.     Overall why I never got this beer over the years is strange. A very nice beer that can warm you on a cool evening, but is very drinkable and goes down easy.

Not a big fan of bitter beers such as IPAs so I wasn't sure how I'd like this one... I was amazed to say the least. This beer is definitely BURSTING with flavor, the coffee note is a strong after taste that complements the body of the beer amazingly, definitely has some floral notes and a quick bitter hoppy punch that quickly recedes, the brown sugar and toffee undertones help this one out and by far this is my favorite beer to date and I HIGHLY recommend!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25 Bottle dated 8/31:  Now listed as a "dark IPA" - huh?  Pours a mahogany brown, though getting past the darkness you can tell it's likely a clear beer (like many of DFH beers). The head builds up a light brown, and remains in a thick rim around the glass throughout the pour, with continents of thin film across the surface.    Nose has a little more roasted nut and even a little darker malt in it. I actually think I get the brown sugar, and a little bitter hops also comes through.    Taste starts off with a little sweetness to a dark bready malt flavor. The bitterness catches up fairly quickly, though, to bring the flavor back into balance. One of the classic brown ale flavors, a light nuttiness comes in to lean this a little more brown than a darker porter, in my opinion. The woodsy hops actually play nicely here, but do seem to add an American hoppiness to this beer (taste and power).    The beer is a little thin rolling over my tongue, but with the bold flavors, this actually helps keep it fairly easy to drink in more than sips.    I expected to rate this beer decently having had it many years ago and enjoying it. But this beer is even better than I recall. The balance of the brown with a little extra hop notes that don't overtake the beer hits the spot.   
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.25 Hey look, a brown ale I'm a fan of. This one is a deep brown, and is replete with minimal light tan head in the 1/3" range. Aroma is interesting, English brown malt, some hopping, a fractional amount of smoke/roast/charred matter.    Taste hits more of the brown and scotch ale notes than it does ipa. Even though 50ibu it seems less than that with everything else going on malt wise.     A pretty cool beer even though I probably go years at a time between having one. Its one of the more respectable offerings from DFH.

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5 355ml bottle into a glass tankard. Paid £3.50 for a single.    Pours a shiny, dark-mahogany body that when held to the light displays some crimson tones and allows small amounts of fine carbonation to be observed. A thick, foamy, one-finger in height, light-tan coloured head with excellent retention slowly reduces to a thin cap, leaving plenty of sticky, soapy lace.    The nose is led predominantly by a combination of warm toasted malts and a darker, more heavily roasted profile. Burnt sugars and roasted coffee beans are noticeable underneath, along with some citric hop bitterness towards the back end. Taste roughly follows suit, leading initially with a faintly sweet mixture of toasted malts, brown sugar, molasses, and lightly burnt caramel. Mid palate, hints of tart cranberry and dried dark stone fruit join lingering semi-sweet malts, before roasted bitterness begins to build. Burnt grains, roasted barley, charred espresso, cocoa and dark baking chocolate become much more prominent towards the latter half, combining with assertive citric and pine hop profiles to finish with increasing bitterness. In the mouth a medium body paired with moderately lively carbonation give a feel that starts slick and smooth before quickly drying as roast profiles intensify. After the swallow, bitter, oily grapefruit rinds, pith and resinous pine hop profiles linger momentarily on the palate, while hints of alcohol warmth give the only indication of the otherwise well-hidden 7.2% ABV.    Overall this is a decent beer. Sweet and bitter, malty and hoppy, complex but easy drinking, it starts as the label promises: a hybrid between a Scotch Ale, IPA and American Brown. The beers latter half however is dominated by a roast profile that’s a little too dark, intense and burnt, which ultimately detracts from balance and drinkability.

Some occupy the space between a stout and a pale ale without much merit to stand out on their own. Not the case here. Tons of reviews here better than mine so I'll just go ahead and sum it up - roasted malt, bitter hops, slightly floral, chocolatey, nutty, burnt caramel, brown sugar. Not too sweet or too bitter. Great balance. Smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation.

I finally snagged a 6 pack about 1 month old. Pours dark brown with a coffee head. The aroma is great: dark malts, caramel, and brown sugar. Sweet caramel notes dominate the taste with hints of chocolate, molasses, complex toasty maltiness, herbal hops and a pleasant bitter aftertaste. The taste is rich, complex, and wonderful. This is almost more of a Scotch IPA - strong caramel with some hoppiness. Creamy mouthfeel with a mild bodied. This beer is utterly unique and a true standout. Highly recommended.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Poured from a bottle into a pint tumbler.    The bottle would lead you to believe that this is a pseudo-brown ale that has been hopped to pieces, like an American Black Ale. WRONG! While somewhat hoppy, this brew is more closely related to a Scotch Ale with it's caramelized sugars, color, and sweetness/mouthfeel.    It's quite good and very well done.    Look: Deep dark mahogany brown. A creamy head of fine bubbles that persists to the very end. Lacing for everyone.  Smell: A lot like a Scotch Ale. Rich, creamy smell of caramelized sugars, pipe tobacco, and a hint of something floral.  Taste: A char tang, somewhat astringent at first. Then the sweetness of caramelized sugars and low-note hop bitterness, with a coffee grounds finish.  Mouthfeel: So smooth, a little bit thick and creamy.

This brew looks great. All dark and foaming. There is little aroma.    That taste is out there. It mixes up so much and it's too early. I have to imagine that I ate a bunch of food (I'm sitting at the bar of a great restaurant, just not hungry). That helps tolerate the amalgam of hops and yeasty and nastiness.     I do remember now that this brew had this big nasty taste. Stay away, Bob, stay away.

When pouring, and the liquid was thin, it was clear. Can't tell clarity when in the glass, too thick. Thin head faded quickly to a cap. Left good lacing.    S---Burnt malts. Caramel & some toffee. No real hops to it. More a brown ale than an IPA.    T---Nose really comes alive. Coffee & other roasted malts. Caramel & toffee show up strong. Again, no real hops presence.    F---Thicker & heavier than an IPA. Feels like a fairly strong brown ale.     O---To rate this to style as an IPA is pointless, that's just not what it seems to be. It is a very good brown ale, though.

You can believe yourself being in the woods if you close your eyes and smells this beer plus a great roastyness. The taste is lighter and more on the caramel. The carbonation is average. This is a great beer but the smell let you want more complexity for the taste but it might be explained by the fact that I enjoyed a great dipa just before that

This is a medium bodied beer with a surprising amount of carbonation that gives this beer a foamy feel.

F -- Medium-to-full body. It's just thick enough that I don't want to go chugging it. It also has a nice carbonation that plays across the tongue.     O -- Very solid.

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 From 12oz. Bottle, about 4 months from bottling.     Look is dark brown and somewhat thin. Not much head, dissipates to light khaki ring.     Smell is subtle and mostly malts, with some sweeter notes... Maybe raisins or other dark fruits? Maybe a fresher bottle would showcase the hops better.     Taste is tremendous, excellent brown ale with sweet maltiness, mild bitterness and enough complexity to be interesting. Not waste this style in my experience.     Feel is medium bodied with a dry finish.     Overall this is better than expected, and the expectations were high. Super easy to drink and very complex yet balanced layers of flavor. Top notch!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Clear brown-amber body, steady stream of bubbles, rich creamy light tan head with polkadot lace. Smell encompasses warm chocolate and toffee malt and formidable, but balanced, piney hop bitterness. The flavor- MMM- the flavor, it is warm and rich with moderately dark chocolate, caramel, nutty toffee, brown sugar, as well as hops with all their acidity and bitterness. Perfect balance betwixt everything. Body is, you guessed it, rich and warm, slightly sticky with sugar, delicate carbonation.  This really does blend it all- a delicious malty chocolate caramel base with a counterpunch of bitter hops. This is, perhaps, DFH's greatest beer. A crazy experiment, not flashy, but well executed, enjoyable, and appealing to many.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Why do we always forget about IBA?    This dry-hopped American brown has been around for more than fifteen years and is one of only five beers on DFH’s current year-round slate, where it’s been a long-time standby. Yet ask a casual fan to name the first DFH brew that comes to mind and it’s rather unlikely “IBA” will pass their lips.    Like many DFH fans, I fear I’ve taken IBA for granted. With an open mind and a fresh palette, I revisited the classic by way of a recent batch.    Poured into a tulip glass from a 12-oz bottle with a 12/30/15 bottled-on date. Allowed to warm out of fridge for about 20 minutes before pouring.    Appearance: Dark brown, with about a 1/2 inch of off-white head that mostly dissipated within a few minutes. Lacing was minimal.    Smell: After pouring, the empty bottle gave off notes of bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, pie crust, and roasted nuts. From the full glass, a slightly herbal bitterness from the hops. As it warmed, I got faint notes of raisin and anise seed.    Taste: Things lead off with a light malt sweetness, followed by a rather assertive two-fold bitterness. Some bitter notes come from the herbal, slightly piney hops, others pounce with the bite of black coffee. It finishes slightly sweet, with a bit of burnt brown sugar. The alcohol lingers, but the bitterness lingers longer.     Mouthfeel: There’s more carbonation on the tongue than you can see in the glass, with a solid body that’s again more complex than its appearance. I don’t know what people are talking about when they say they can’t detect the alcohol here—it’s here.    Notes: Dogfish beers always have a lot going on –the question is whether everybody plays well together. In IBA, we have harmony, an enjoyably complex brown that shows you don’t need to pack a 10+ ABV to work as a sipper.

Nice nut brown head with good retention. Smell is deep and malty, with a hint of creaminess. Taste and mouthfeel are fantastic. Could almost be a porter, but lighter. Sweet malt, creaminess, and just enough hop bitterness to balance everything out. Delicious and drinkable, a dangerous combination.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Bottle date of 12/2/15. Poured extremely cold. 1 finger head, but I don't particularly care for head size/retention anyway. Right away, fuggle and williamette hops jump at out at me. The proper words used to describe them are "spicy, earthy, woody". Not my preferred hops but oh well. They use caramelized sugar so I was expecting the aftertaste to be a bit dry but it was not so. Look was dark, almost like a porter. Bitterness was manageable, didn't stick in the mouth like regular IPA's. Mouthfeel was alright, you kind of get a blast of the earthy-woody hops on the way down. Alright beer, neat concept. Much of the malt character unfortunately gets lost in the bitterness of the hops. I got some dark caramel and crystal malts mostly via smell.   Wouldn't get again though.

Smell is typical for a brown, sweet malt with brown sugar and coffee undertones. Taste is a complex blend of carmel, malt, and coffee with big smack of bitterness crashing in at the end. Mouthfeel is surprisingly much thinner than it looks and smells, but on the bright side, that makes it easier to drink more than one.

If you are a fan of dark beer and have never tried this one....get one and enjoy .. The 95 rating is on the mark!

Taste is bitter grassy pine, mild citrus fruits, roasty caramelized brown sugar and molasses, with mild chocolate and earthy wood notes to balance it out.

look: 4.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Appearance - A lot darker than I expected. It looks like a stout or a porter in the glass. Little bits of light coming through the glass from the corners. 2 finger head that dissipates quickly.    Smell - was expecting a bit more on the nose. Bottle is fairly fresh at 2 months old, but I'm only getting faint smells. Caramelised sugar is there, roasted malt, hops, and a touch of alcohol.    Taste - Very very smooth. Caramelised sugar up front, with a fair bit of hops on the back end. Has a nice bitterness to finish.It's almost a mix between an IPA and a porter. Very well balanced beer.

Smooth and big in mouth, with a dry edge. The aftertaste is roasted and sweet, with a solid nutty and toffee linger. Smooth, dry finish. Great beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12 oz bottle served at cellar temperature into a pint glass. Sadly the last of 6 bottles to be enjoyed over the past week weeks following a visit to New York State.    Appearance - an aggressive pour yielded a dark mahogany coloured beer, with gat clarity and topped by a finger and a half of tan head. Pretty good head extension and some sparse lacing lingers around the edges of the glass.    Smell - big aroma of coarse grain, some dark fruit, a hint of wood and smoke. A little caramel mixed in for good measure. A very aromatic beer for the style.    Taste - grain flavours, followed by some mild bitterness, slightly earthy hops, a smoked or burnt flavor, and a touch of caramel at the end. Complex and nice complementary profile. The roasted and slightly smokey flavor is the star, which may or may not appeal to everyone.    Mouthfeel - smooth, medium bodied with good carbonation and a fairly dry finish.    Overall - one of the best brown ales out there, it's a hybrid in that the significant hop presence and the woodsy aromas and flavours with the smokey elements gives you a different beer than many browns, but it works very well here. Top notch stuff that will grow on you more, the more you enjoy.

It poured a dark brown with reddish hues and a creamy tan head and lacing. Because of the temperature it was hard to really appreciate the smell but I definitely discerned chocolate and nutty caramel. This is a very tasty brown ale with a base of roasted malt with chocolate, coffee, and nuts. There is also some vanilla/caramel sweetness and it finishes with more than a hint of hoppy bitterness. In sum, it is an extremely well-balanced ale. At 7.20% ABV, it is very drinkable; you can easily have a second. Overall, this is a very well crafted brown ale that blends different flavors extremely well. It is a pleasure to drink.

IPA's have never been my favorite style but when mixed with malts and sugar it creates one of the more balanced yet at the same time flavorful beers I've ever had.

The nutty maltiness you expect from a brown ale. Some faint hop aroma as well.    T: Bisquity, toasted malt flavor and caramelized wort. Significant hop bitterness with a pretty clean flavor profile overall. Finishes fairly sweet; you can really taste the brown sugar.    F: Medium body, medium carbonation: appropriate.    O: Quite a nice beer. A very unorthodox brown ale and one I expected to be more like an IPA, but a nice, sweet sipper nonetheless. Strikes me as a cross between a brown ale, an IPA and a Scotch ale.

Hope they keep this in their lineup for a good while.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Dogfish Head is a brewery that puts out a lot of nonsense that I don't care about. However, they do have some great standards. I say this both in the meaning of the level of quality the Dogfish brewers accept and in the sense of a song that has established and lasting popularity. Their 90 minute IPA and their Palo Santo beer are some great examples of this, but the list wouldn't be complete without the Indian Brown Ale. The name suggests an overzealous and directionless blend of styles but on the contrary the beer itself is exemplary. This beer should pique the interest of IPA lovers just as much as those more inclined to amber and browns. I drank it from the conical pint glass that I poured the 12 oz bottle into.     Look: Beautiful dark brown that inspires images of the other fine brown things in life. Think leather bicycle seats, old and well loved copies of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, and trees.     Smell: Caramel raisin sweetness blended with a hoppy bouquet of leather samples. The type of adult candy that most children just can't seem to understand with their stupid child minds.     Taste: Here's where the fireworks of this beer are at. Each flavor of the beer's concept (IPA, American Brown, and Scotch Ale) gets a spotlight without overshadowing any other. The piney hops compliment the sweeter candy sides of the scotch ale side keeping the beer mellow throughout. There's some chocolate and dark fruit tastes without the unrelenting sweet and boozy characteristics of a full blown, big scotch ale.    Feel: The beer remains effervescent while being smooth and full feeling. It's just another testament to the brewer's masterful standard for this hybrid.     Overall: Most hybrids suck. Fusion food is bad, hybrid crossover fruits like pluots would be better off thinking for themselves, and beer hybrids often seem like ill attempts for non-creative brewers to sound interesting at whatever shitty dinner parties they go to. This beer is a strong exception to this rule. The standard to which it's held sets a high bar for beers of each style it takes from without sacrificing in any way. I think Dogfish Head's Indian Brown Ale is a completely worthwhile beer.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Thanks Ted. Time to conquer a personal whale.  This was poured into a nonic pint glass.  The appearance was a dark brown color with a thick tan foamy head that had wonderful sticky lacing around the glass.  The smell started off with cocoa, bread, caramel and a light earthy and semi-citrusy hoppiness rolling in underneath.  The taste was basically the same but with a slight bitter floral hoppy quality in underneath. Breadiness comes back in the aftertaste and roams into a dry semi-citric finish.  The mouthfeel was moderately light to medium bodied with an okay sessionable dark feel to it. There's some heaviness coming in like Flynn to bring the roast and dry somewhat puckering bitterness laying down on my tongue.  Overall, this is what I hoped the greatest of American Brown ales could be. In like Flynn, of course I'd have this again.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Beautiful, robust dark brown ale with thick, longlasting head. Nearly too dark, but why complain, this is a beautiful beer.  Nose is lots of cocoa, dark bread, charred caramel ..... wow, this smells like heaven for a brown ale, and I do not get much hop in the nose, and I don't want much hop, despite the warning on the label and the rep of the brewer for super-hopping. Nose wins.  Taste is not the same. I taste a florally-hopped black IPA, where all the cocoa and caramel are completely overwhelmed by puckering floral hops. A bready thickness remains beyond the hop dryness and carries into the finish, reminding me however faintly that I'm still drinking a dark ale.  Feel is full and heavy (nice), with too much tingly carb and puckering dryness for what I wish was a strong, mellow brown. Can't win 'em all.  Overall, great nose, full body shows it's packed with a great blend of dark and amber malts. For my taste (and I lovelovelove me some hoppy pales), this has too much hop infusion for a good brown. I know DFH was and is in front of the curve on many craft-brew "things", and in this case, they pre-figured the black IPA by a decade or so. Still a super-quality offering. The nose makes me wish they would brew an updated brown that doesn't try to win the hop wars. It would be heavenly.

Its high enough alcohol percentage that I can drink one and be good for relaxing night at home. With that said for a 7% alcohol content it not harsh at all. also has a great coffee after taste that I very much enjoy. Smells of caramel, chocolate and raisins. Tastes like more of a malty caramel and raisins. Great beet overall and definitely will enjoy it while i am on the east coast.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 Bottled on 07/24/15. Poured from a 12 oz bottle to a snifter at 50F.   Immensely fluffy thick head about 5 fingers thick causes me to make this a two-pour. Fantastic head retention and medium lacing in the beginning. Definitely a dark beer, but not opaque. There's a very unique crimson red glow when held up to the light, but otherwise it looks close to a typical Scotch ale but with much better head characteristics.     I get a sweet red apple scent with maybe a very light scent of bitter coffee, and straight malt. Lastly, there are faint and sporadic, but definitely present whiffs of molasses every now and then, which pop out of the glass and smack me in the nose.     This beer is amazingly silky smooth. Medium mouth feel with medium carbonation. Just very smooth and it seems like the beer permeates every area of my entire mouth the instant it touches my lips. It is certainly lip smacking good.     The flavors in this beer are delicious and unique, yet blended so well that not much 'sticks out' so-to-speak. The hops are moderately bitter and slightly spicy, but sort of neutral in flavor. The bitterness definitely lingers on the palette. As this beer warms, the caramel is coming out and there's this almost cinnamon candy like spiciness (but not flavor) about it. Think apple pie cinnamon. I can't help but feel like this beer would be amazing with a fried apple pie.     Over all this beer is on a whole other level, as with many other Dogfish Head beers. I think it's outstanding, unique, and very drinkable, which is why I give it 5 stars   
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5 One of my go to beers. This is a fantastic beer all around. Big malty, chocolatey, toasty notes. A nice hop backbone. This is a perfect Brown Ale, this coming from a person who has a love hate relationship with Dogfish Head beers. 2 Thumbs up!

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Ahhh. Made it to Portland. Served in a Nonic Pint.     Appearance : Pours a colossal, bubbly popcorn colored head that fills most of the glass, which leaves great webs and hills of lace behind as it recedes slowly. The body is Chestnut-Mahogany colored and a little bit of light squeezes some cranberry hues out of it. 60% Opaque. Overall a very nice looking beer.    Smell : Quite a sticky aroma, with sap, caramel, prune, burnt pecan, walnut, roasted malts, a touch of anise and a circumvention of polite hop. A little odd for a brown ale, but a pleasant aroma.     Taste : It's liberally hopped but not over hopped, if that makes sense. Lots of caramel on the finish, with plum and roast malts in the middle...and just like the nose, it's circumvented (and cut up the middle) by spicy dried out hop. Slight alcohol surfaces as the beer warms up and the hop also peeks through quite a bit more, realizing some of the IPA inspiration.     Feel : Medium bodied in a text-book fashion. Mild (although buzzing) carbonation which this beer could benefit from a little more of. It ends with an alcoholic dryness and a slight stickiness. A slight dock because more carbonation could really knock the feel out of the park.     Overall : For $2.16 I feel I got a great beer, and although I probably wouldn't purchase again, I won't discourage anybody else from doing so. This was a departure yet still a great representation of the style. I'm assuming "Indian" is where the liberal hop comes in, otherwise it's just an American Brown. Not bad, not bad at all.

Appearance  Chestnut brown with ruby red highlights. 1 finger of creamy tan head with good retention. Good clarity with lively carbonation.    Nose  Caramel, brown sugar, roasted barley, and faint citric hops.    Taste  Caramelized brown sugar, roasted barley, and some toffee sweetness. Hints of chocolate and smoke. The hops are mostly lost due to the old bottle but there are some citric and earthy hops subtly lingering.    Mouthfeel  Medium bodied, crisp, oily, and off-dry with a moderate bitterness.    Overall  New or old, this beer taste great either way.

Pours clear ruby Amber with nice persistent off white head. Smells of caramel & brown malts, figs, brown sugar and spicy hops. Malts seem to slightly overwhelm the hops but they compliment each other quite nicely. Tastes like a scotch ale with ample bitterness, a lighter mouthfeel, and great drinkability. Super smooth and a great beer to pair with a variety of foods. Nicely done. A very nice change up to today's standard IPAs. This one was def a trendsetter when it first came out.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Actually found/tried this at the beach, when looking for something other than an IPA or a shandy to drink! Interesting beer, which DH pushes as a hybrid Scotch-IP-Brown Ale. The taste really seems to follow suit, with some sweetness, hops, and kick. The sweetness tends to come in at the front and linger, with the finish being pretty boozy. The IPA portion tends to present near the middle--once or twice more than I cared for in all honesty:(not a fan of the style)--but all and all, it remains pretty buried in the mix. Color is a darkish brown, with a decent head development and glass lacing. If there's a critique besides the occasional hop rush, it would be the prevalence of the alcohol in the finish, which to me at least, can come off a little "raw / harsh" at times.

Honestly, I would have said this is a porter if I was unaware of the brown ale labeling. I bought this on the recommendation of Wine Enthusiast, and other reviews, and like many Dogfish brews, I was not disappointed. Is it earth-shattering, no, but its an excellent brew that I feel many would come to appreciate. Definitely put one in your six-pack next time you visit your local beverage store.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5 Look:  A decent head that is thick and tan. Decent head retention. Color was deep brown and red, very dark, but you can still see through to the world on the other side. This one was surprisingly clear!    Smell:  Chocolate and caramel and some floral hop notes. It also has a slight smoked malt scent.    Taste:   Instant bittering hops upfront that fades into a deep roasted malt flavor with hints of coffee and chocolate. After the bittering hops subside, there is a slight sweet and caramel flavor. The sweetness is short lived and it finishes quite dry. There is a slight fruitiness with flavors of plums and figs.    Feel:  Full bodied and decent amount of fizz. There is a slight dry pull on the tongue.    Overall:  This is a pretty unique IPA (which I was expecting) that was very dark, rich, and malty. This is something that I would buy again. Dogfish Head makes some unique brews (or is that off-centered?).

The head is creamy and smooth. Strong lacing.    Smell: Toffee, caramel, grassy hops, a bit of vanilla and sugared dates.     Taste: Very intense and sweet flavors of caramelized sugars, dates, toffee, coco nibs, and a backing of piney hops.     Feel: Full-bodied, smooth, wet, creamy, and a tiny bit dry at the very end. It reminds me of bitter dark chocolate.    Overall: Very satisfying, rich, full, and well executed. I could see myself using this beer in a number of culinary applications as well.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 Pretty silky smooth. It is very dark for an ale. The bottle says it is "hopped liberally and often" but the hops is balanced by the sweetness so it doesn't taste as "hoppy" as an IPA normally does. It is quite sweet. Pleasant.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75 Some good roasty notes, but hops are also featured in this medium-weight brown ale. Moderate carbonation. Light sweetness on the palate but followed by hop bitterness on the tail end.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4 July 27, 2015    12 oz bottle, snifter    A – Deep brown with tones of rich mahogany and ruby red tinting. Quite clear.  Maybe a quarter-inch of off-white to light tan foam, made of large bubbles, that fades fairly fast.     S – Caramel and brown sugar, along with light toffee and a touch of chocolate. Woodsy and herbal hops with some minor tropical notes.     T – Brown sugar and mild caramel. Just a minor chocolate note. Hops are woodsy but also fruity, some bitter grapefruit and darker tropical fruits. A moderate oakiness becomes noticeable on the finish.    M – Moderate to medium-high carbonation with a medium body. Some mild sudsiness. Sweet up front from the extra sugar but bitterness increases through the finish, lingering on the aftertaste.    O – More hop-bitter and flavorful than most brown ales, and I like it. The strength is deceptive. Lots of complementary and contrasting flavors. Complex.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Finally got around to this. Of course had to run to WI to get it. Currently #6 in am. brown ale category.  Great aroma with soft darker malts and a sweet sugary quality that moves to caramel. Nicely complex for style.  Smallish and dark head with some lacing. Dark brown with reddish highlights.  Again complex, esp. for style. Just enough alcohol to taste and add some complexity. It mingles with the hops nicely as it moves towards soft bittering on the finish. Again soft darker malts that are a bit drying but the sugary sweetness contrasts nicely.  Moderately light feel for style, even seeming a bit on the thin side. But it's not a distraction or problem.  This is good as it gets for style.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 A: [4.75] Looks pretty fantastic in the glass. Dark brown cola colored beer. Forms a dense 1 finger head of off white bubbles. The bubbles look creamy and have some staying power. Really nice lacing on the glass. The bottle lists the ABV (7.2%). There is a date code that means this was made 12/11/14.    S: [4.00] I get coffee initially. Then some whole wheat bread smells.    T: [4.25] Sweet upfront then moves into a really nice malt flavor. The roasty malts are fantastic. I am getting little to no hops - but I am not complaining. The rich roasted malt flavor is great.    M: [4.00] Smooth and creamy feeling with a medium body. Low carbonation and low bitterness.    O: [4.25] Blindfolded I would call this a porter. It has the coffee aroma, it has the great roasted malt flavor... The lable talks a lot about how it is liberally hopped. I am getting no hop bite. Based on the brewed date maybe the hops have faded. I am totally fine without them. This is a really great beer. Nice aroma, excellent taste and a smooth body. I will drink this again.   
look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.25 Hoppy but not citrus-y. Malty but not fruity. Dry.... very dry. Another reviewer mentions flavor of bread crust. I would add hint of burst toast, which ruins it for me. I think this would go better with some spicy or otherwise strong-flavored foods. It's not a very good brew for just sipping on its own.   
look: 3.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75 Nice beer overall. Unlike many browns you don't just taste the caramel - tastes like a crust of good homemade rye bread. Interestingly the one I had at the Dogfish head pub was better then from the bottle. Better chilled.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 What a great brown ale. Pours beautifully with a cola appearance and a finger of sea foam head. Love the style anyway, but this might be my favorite dogfish head beer. Nice balance of hops on what is no doubt a toasty caramel forward beer. Very easy to drink because it's on the lower ABV end at just over 5%, and carbonation lifts the malts so they aren't too heavy. Do yourself a favor and try this if you are into brown ales in any way.

It was a tough call though between this one and a variety of other excellent beers such as Ommegang, Founders, and New Belgium. I found a small fridge where they had some 6 packs of this already chilled for me so I grabbed one and headed for the checkout counter. It boasts an 7.2% ABV and 50 IBUs, let’s take a gulp!    Look: This one pours a clear dark cola color with plenty of carbonation trails running up to the surface. The head is medium and about one to two fingers thick with a decent pour and has lingering thick lacing on the glass. The blackness gives way to orange copper hues in light, very beautiful and clear.     Smell: The aroma is thick caramel and oak. I get a strong sense of smoky oaks and toasted butter and brown sugar.    Taste: This beer is a rare and amazing mixture of Scotch Ale, an India Pale Ale and an American Brown which is one of the main reasons I wanted to try it. It really does exhibit the subtle hops of an IPA, the caramel backbone and rich smooth flavor of a Scotch Ale, and the color exhibited by an American Brown. Quite the trio here and well worth a try.     Mouthfeel: This beer drinks so smooth and lacy at first and then the fizzle that comes from the plentiful carbonation makes this one mildly reminiscent of a coca-cola.     Overall: I’d say that this is an excellent beer for anyone to try. It really packs a unique variety of smells, flavors, and attributes making a refreshing experience outside of the norm.

Taste: Roasted malt and bread crust up front, leading into a strong resinous, grassy, citric hop flavor and bitterness. Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Finish: Hop bitterness is prominent in the swallow, but quickly disappears leaving a roastiness that lingers. Overall: a very well made beer, that definitely has a cross of ABA and IPA

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4 Poured from a 12oz bottle (bottled on 03Mar15) into a pint glass. Pours with a half finger's worth of khaki foam that dissipates into a line within 15 seconds. Dark brown in color with a ruby tint. Bubbles are scarce. Has mild aromas of roasted malts, sweet chocolate, and molasses with a hint of raisin and bitter hops. Intial taste is of strong molasses, and mild chocolate and bitter, earthy hop flavors. Mild roasted malt flavors along with a hint of raisin sweetness and ginger (that comes from nowhere) are next to enter the palate as all flavors persist into the aftertaste. Light-bodied, mildly carbonated, smooth, with a crisp finish. This is yet another unique tasting brew from DFH. Definitely not what I expected from an American Brown So, but I loved it.  NOTE: As beer warms, aromas and flavors change drastically, as in the case of most all brown ales. I would love to try this again, but at room temperature.

No real hop aroma. The hops must be hidden under the strong roasted nuttiness. I know this is a brown ale with extra hops so I'll be looking for that in the taste.     Taste is fantastic! Solid classic brown ale flavored of nutty malts and molasses with a bright hoppy dryness that lingers a while on the tung.     Overall maybe the best brown I've had. I love the addition of the lasting bitterness that comes with the nut and molasses flavors.

Aroma: Minerally, roasty. Quite mild on the nose. Sweeter as it warms. Raisin and molasses come out as it approaches room temp.    Taste: Dry, hoppy arrival. Light, and slightly sour and roasty across mid-palate. Surprisingly clean, highly bitter finish. Slight lingering bitterness.     Mouthfeel: Heavier side of mid-weight. High carbonation, higher than typical for the style, I think. Ever so slight slickness.       Overall: Wow; this is not at all what I expected. This does not really taste like a brown ale; but whatever it is, I like. Too malty to be a black IPA, but too hoppy to be a brown ale, and too light to be a stout. If I'm in a mood for a brown ale, this would not be a go-to. But there is a mood that suits this beer perfectly. It and Brown Shugga and Seventh Son's American Strong Ale are bunched together for me. A wintertime hoppy alternative to the typical stout.

Nice dark brown in color w/ a beige head that hangs around a bit. I found the taste to be fairly hoppy in the beginning, and more balanced the closer it became to room temp. At that point the malts and darker flavors rushed forward. This is when I really began to enjoy it. This is a very serviceable pour, yet didn’t stand out from any of the other brown ales I’ve tried.

I missed the hops in the smell but wow, what a nice balance in a heavy duty tasty spicy strong brown ale, it manages a caramel candy rum vs grapefruit celery leaf battle that my mouth really enjoys. Have had before and will have again.

Smells like a barleywine. Almost smells just like 120 minute but hold up...    This shit tastes so well balanced it's not funny. Not what I was expecting at all. Yeah, it's crisp. How does it taste this bright and crisp but it's so dark? The hops, that must be it. Caramel aftertouch. Yum.    Feels like the lips of a just shaved vagina. Wonderful.    Drank this out of a Lagunitas wide mouth mason jar. Amazing beer. Must have. Wish they sold six packs.   
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4 Beautiful stout-like color, light to moderate head retention. Aroma of caramelized malt, raw sugar, slight molasses, and rustic wheat germ bread. Palate unfortunately does not confirm the nose. Alcohol is a bit overwhelming the flavor, but is not unpleasant.     Flavor is summed up with moderate to deep roasted malt, smooth texture, and coffee bean and alcohol on the finish.     Decent beer for style, would not purchase again, unless pairing with food.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 L: I would say this about a 19 on the SRM chart. The color is like really dark root beer. The head is thick and tan and about two and three quarters inches that goes to about two in 30 seconds and dissipates slowly overall.    S: Chocolate aroma present with some floral notes. I picked up a piny presence plus a little cedar bark underneath it.    T: Definite roasted hops bitterness present roughly medium to medium high - it's there though. There is a mild sweetness and even some coffee and dark chocolate notes. It is a very subtle and complex flavor, IMO. The bitterness lasts and stays on the tongue but not in a bad way.     F: Medium body, and mild fizz as far as carbonation.    O: The aromas are nice and interesting, especially for me as it has been a lot of IPA's recently. The flavors are very interesting and are very subtle and complex. The balance in the flavors is deep and has layers to it. They took their time with this one and it shows. I would definitely drink this again. The ABV is actually beyond the standards @ 7.2% but that just makes things more interesting. Cheers.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25 Served on tap in a pint glass at Paxti's Pizza in Campbell, CA    A: Very dark bown, light at the edges but on the darker end of the scale for brown ales. Half a finger of mocha colored head that laced the glass very nicely.  S: Chocolate, coffee grounds, lightly roasted malts, hints of caramel and a little spice.  T: Follows the nose well. Lots of coffee upfront, followed by a light chocolate/caramel in the middlemouth and coffee in the aftertaste.   M: Medium to light mouthfeel. Carbonation is dialed in about right to rinse your palette with each sip.  O: I had this a long while back and didn't think much of it. It was worth drinking again for a re-review as I give it considerably higher marks this time. Excellent brown ale, very rich and flavorful without being overbearing.

An interesting blend been dark malt roastiness, with some sweeter sugary flavors, and subtle hop notes.    Mouthfeel - 3.75/5  Medium-full in body. A light amount of medium intensity carbonation. Very crisp.    Overall - 4/5  Overall, a great beer.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Brown, coarsely foam, with an almost black, ember color.     Bitter chocolate, burned malts, toffee, almost stout like aromas.     Malty beginning, hints of sweet toffee, soon overwhelmed by a more breadish taste of malt going along with a sligthly sweetened chocolate. Hoppy bitterness brings in even more complexity, goes well along with the upcoming coffee flavor. Kicks in late, gives the malt aromas much time to develop. Bitterness adds a floral taste to the beer, which pairs up well with the malty body which dominates throughout. Coffee aftertaste is very present, staying long on the tongue. Surprisingly it isn’t very bitter, but leaving a smooth dry mouthfeel.     This is a very interesting and enjoyable beer, reminds me somehow of the "Schumacher 1838er", while being a little more aggressive on the hops.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5 Looks nearly like cola in a glass. The color, thickness (or thinness) and its bubbly carbonation all remind of the appearance of cola. Maybe a point darker than cola, it is not transparent... but its close.    Aroma is wonderfully hoppy in the beginning. The more that it warms in the glass, the more the malty aromas stick through.    Oh man, its taste is beautiful. Absolute bliss. The perfect blend of malt character followed by hoppy notes. Some sips I get the hops first and the wonderful roasted malts second, other times it seems to taste the other way around. Either way, this is an excellent balance of the two. Very nicely done.    Exactly medium-bodied. If anyone ever asks me what a medium-bodied beer should be iike, I will show them this one, it is spot-on.    I'm impressed with this one.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Appearance - Pours 2 quick fingers of light mocha head, color is a transparent deep dark copper brown with reddish maroon highlights. Active carb rises from the bottom, and each quaff leaves a nice foamy ring of lace.    Smell - Roasted malt, brown sugar, light molasses, lite soy sauce, lightly toasted wheat bread, and a light grassiness.    Taste - Begins roasted malts and toast with a dusting of brown sugar, even a hint of dark unsweetened bakers chocolate - this is almost immediately followed with a good dose of grassy and herbal hops, with hints of basil, mint and pine on the back of the tongue. The finish is dried lightly burnt toast, some dried fruit stones, bakers chocolate, and dried brown grass. This is probably the most hops I've tasted in a brown ale.    Mouthfeel - Nearly medium and very smooth, with some slight astringency and dryness at the back. Carb is on the lighter side, with a few light edges at the back of the tongue, but no scrub whatsoever - allowing the hops to "sink in" and assert during each quaff.     Overall - A very flavorful brown ale, and very interesting to me, not your typical brown ale with the stronger presence of hops here. Not a bad thing at all, as it clearly says this on the label - and they mean it. Throw a few ounces of your favorite IPA into a brown ale and that's what you have here.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 10/15/2014. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, molasses, light dark fruit, herbal, grass, light pine, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, molasses, light dark fruit, herbal, grass, pine, and roast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, herbal, grass, light pine, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome hoppy brown ale style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.

Perfect head came right to the top of the pint glass.    S- Smells kind of like a porter with a bit of a sweeter brown sugar aroma.    T- It taste like a scotch ale (which I admittedly haven't tried very many of). It really reminds me of the taste of Oskar Blues Old Chubb, except this Dogfish Head tastes a little more hoppy, and a little more sweet, but only just a little.    F- Carbonation is just a tad weak. It seems like they wanted to create the illusion that it has more body by slightly under carbonating it, but this beer is a little to thin to pull this off. If it was carbonated just a tiny bit more it would be perfect.    Overall, this is a very solid beer that I will definitely pick up again. This would really hit the spot if you're craving a darker beer during the warm summer months.

I've continued onto IPA's , but not to much of a stout fan.    Anyway, this is by far the best high alcohol brown ale I have ever had. Its just so perfect in every way. Absolutely smooth and so enjoyable to sip and swirl.. I plan on using this beer to introduce craft beer virgins into this exciting market. I love the idea of giving these small breweries my money that the giant commercial beer makers out there.    Cheers to Dogfish on making me a so very happy customer with this WONDERFUL BROWN ALE!!!!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75 Another fantastically unique beer from Dogfish Head. Like Namaste or Aprihop, Indian Brown Ale makes a strong case for DFH's "other" beers that aren't really as well known as their 60 or 90-minute IPAs, at least not in WI. Like the aforementioned "other" beers, Indian Brown Ale is a superior and unique take compared to the standard for it's category. Too hoppy to be a true brown ale, but too malty to be even an English-style IPA. The hops take the edge off of the big coffee and caramel flavors, and this beer feels light for its style. I don't drink brown ales often, but this will be my go-to from now on.   
look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 I've tried many Dogfish Head beers and frankly, I don't find many of them very good. I appreciate pushing the limits and trying non-mainstream ingredients, but every experiment doesn't need bottling.    This one, however, is one of the few that I find very, very good and would recommend.    Nice dark brown color with tan head that slowly dissipates. Good lacing. Good malty caramel aroma that is not overpowering. Slight hop and bitter blends well with the malt.    The beer as is advertised.

S: Smells very caramel up front with some hop.    T: Wonderful caramel with that delicate coffee flav at the end.    F: Creamy mouth feel with light carbonation - perfect balance.    O: One of the best browns I've ever had.

This one packs a lot of flavor in. Brown sugar, toasted bread, roasted malts. There is a lot to appreciate here. Dogfish head delivers the goods on this one.    M: Medium bodied, drinkable and smooth.    O: I am not crazy about brown ales, but this one is top notch. The hops and the burnt sugar set this apart from the pack of boring masses in this style. Well done Dogfish Head!   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 I admit I'm not a fan of brown ales. While there are several notable exceptions, if I walk into a new brewery and sample a range of their beers, the chances are pretty good that I will find their brown ale boring.    DFH's Indian Brown Ale is anything but boring. It's an excellent balance of malty goodness, a little sweetness and caramel, and just the right amount of pizazz from the hops. It's a great beer for drinking with a meal, but has plenty enough character to stand on its own.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75 12 ounce bottle, poured into a pint glass    Appearance: Pours a gorgeous, deep, dark, mahogany color, with a quarter of a finger of white head that quickly dissolved away into a thin lacing of foam that almost completely covered the top of the beer.    Aroma: Lots of toasted and roasted malt up front, imparting some subtle notes of smoke, freshly baked bread, dark chocolate, brown sugar and some subtle hops.    Taste: Damn, that’s good! Massive malt bomb up front, giving off flavors of freshly baked dark bread, roasted chestnuts or walnuts, dark chocolate, and brown sugar-like sweetness, all beautifully balanced with some assertive, but not overpowering hops.    Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied to slightly chewy, and pretty smooth, as there is practically not carbonation what-so-ever. With an ABV of 7.2%, there is just a touch of alcohol on the palate.    Overall: Jesus, this is an outstanding beer! Strong, beautifully balanced flavors of malt, sweet and hops, wrapped up in a smooth quaff! Delicious! Another awesome beer from Dogfish Head, one of my favorite breweries.   
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4 Dark brown, a tuby shine when held towards the light, small beige head quick to a small lace.  Smell of roasted grain, caramel, faint nut, used coffee filter, some cocoa, light fruitiness underneath.  Rich caramel up front, with toasted grain, light hazelnut and some raisin and date too, and quite a lot of crisp citrus. Malts start to cover up, with some cocoa powder and rich toasted bread. Light coffee in the finish and a bit of bitter hop.  Aftertaste has roasted grain and bread, with a bit of nut and cocoa powder. Hops seem to disappear. Medium body, light carbonation, easy to drink.  Can't say it blew my mind. Rich, really tasty, with a bit of extra hop, a bit complex, but quite quaffable, and still, no real "wow!" factor.

A- Dark brown with slight amber and black highlights. Half finger head that moves a fairly thick lace. Decent retention on the side of the glass.     S - Grains, slight hops, dark fruit, cocoa, smoke, wood    T - Some caramel, cocoa, mild citrus, burnt grains. The description on the bottle seems spot on. Very clean and you can tell it was dry hopped.    M - Carbonation is medium light, things get chewy and a little sticky as it warms.     O - A well put together brown hybrid. Still looking for that brown ale that will stop me from reminiscing about the original Pete's Wicked.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25 Pours a dark, dark brown, with a subtle red tinge. Almost no head, what there is is very fine. Lightly carbonated, heavier body. Smells of sweet and dark malt. Leads with brown sugar malt, balanced caramel sweetness and a fair amount of hoppy bitterness, lingering finish of coffee and subtle smoke. Small amount of alc bite on some finishes. An interesting, while not outlandish, brown. Not bad at all. I’m nota huge brown fan, but if I’ll order one, it’ll be this.

That being said, I can't give you that in depth a review, but I'll do my best.    Looks: Nice deep brown. Very appetizing.    Smell:It smells good. Maybe a little underwhelming, but also appetizing.    Taste: This is where it really shines. Fantastic caramel malt start with a wonderful hoppy finish. Maybe even a little chocolate at the end, but my palette is not that developed. Really excellent, I can't swoon enough.    Feel: Very smooth in the mouth, and going down. I took off half a point because I felt it should be a little more carbonated.    Overall: Stellar on all counts. I bought this because I was worried the 60 minute IPA would be too hoppy for my friends, and figured this would be more balanced. I was right, and won big on the gamble. Everyone loved it. Get yourself some.
